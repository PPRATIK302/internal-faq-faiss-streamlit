Some homeowners and designers might desire a seamless transition from polished internal floor to external paving, with no change in level between the two, but this can have a serious effect on material durability and occupant health.
It’s vital for builders to observe ground clearances – the minimum distances that claddings and floor levels must be from the ground levels outside or under the building, to keep building materials and the interior as dry as possible.
Water splash onto absorbent claddings.
Cladding, framing or flooring absorbing water.
Premature failure of paint finishes when claddings are continuously damp (eg when soil is in contact with the cladding).
Blocked drainage from E2/AS1 20 mm cavities.
Blocked drainage slots for veneer cladding – water builds up in the cavity, causing rot, dampness and mould inside the building.
Blocked drainage slots for aluminium joinery – water drains inside, damaging floors and floor coverings.
Paving, paths and gardens that have been built up against the wall cladding, often with the finished level above floor level, can cause water to flow inside.
Blocked subfloor ventilation openings in suspended timber floors – dampness causes premature deterioration of timber framing and flooring materials.
Suspended timber floors too close to the ground – moisture from the ground that gets absorbed by framing, flooring and cladding can cause rot, dampness and mould inside the building.
Inadequate space for maintenance access under suspended timber floors.
Increased humidity levels inside the building.
Surface water entering the foul water drainage system because the gully trap is installed below ground level.
It’s vital for builders to observe ground clearances – the minimum distances that claddings and floor levels must be from the ground levels outside or under the building, to keep building materials and the interior as dry as possible
The rules for minimum permitted ground clearances are set out in Building Code Acceptable Solution E1/AS1 and NZS 3604 .
Ask for accurate drawings from the designer and follow them. These should show correct site levels (including contours and slopes) and minimum slab to ground clearances.
Ensure the set-out on site works from the datum point that the designer has used.
Make allowance for future landscaping, particularly where extra soil will be brought on site, or where paving will be added.
Remove surplus soil from the area immediately around the building.
Make sure drainage slots to veneer claddings and aluminium joinery are clear.
Don’t obstruct subfloor vents with framing, plaster or paint.
Ensure basement walls that are retaining soil are tanked to prevent moisture entry.
Advise the owner not to build up soil, mulch, paths, driveways or paving around the base of the building (unless the top surface will be below the bottom edge of the cladding (see table below), any subfloor vents or veneer drainage slots) and not to place any planting in front of subfloor vents.
Slope the area around the building away from it, so that surface water does not drain towards the building.

Your building designs can affect the health and safety of workers constructing, maintaining and demolishing buildings
This is recognised in the Health and Safety at Work Act (HSWA), which was introduced in 2015. It sets out the principles, duties and rights in relation to work health and safety. Although the HSWA focuses on the design of workplaces rather than domestic dwellings, it is important legislation to keep in mind when designing any type of building.
What is health and safety by design?
Health and safety by design is the process of using design to manage health and safety risks throughout the life cycle of a structure, plant, substance or other product. In the context of designing a building, this means considering the health and safety risks throughout the construction, lifetime use, maintenance, and demolition and disposal of a building.
Your power to influence safety
Designers are in a prime position to make buildings, and working on buildings, healthy and safe from the start of the design process. Your decisions will influence the health and safety aspects of a building for its entire lifespan. Making changes at the concept and design phase to improve safety is not only more effective, it can also reduce construction and maintenance costs.
Consider the whole life cycle
For each phase of a building’s life, there will be different hazards for people to consider. It helps to break down the different phases and ask yourself how your design will affect health and safety, and if there are any improvements you can reasonably make, for example:
Can builders construct your design safely?
Work sites already contain a range of health and safety hazards, and site- or design-specific details can introduce new or unexpected hazards. Consider talking to the building contractor, if possible, about how they plan to construct the building and any hazards they anticipate. You may spot things in your design you didn’t see before, and have the opportunity to make improvements.
Will the home be safe and healthy to live in?
The Building Code has many features that improve the health and safety of buildings for occupants, such as insulation requirements and barriers on balconies. However, the minimum standards of the Building Code are just that – minimum standards. Are there further improvements you could make?
Can the building be safely maintained?
For example, are there lightbulbs or other features that require a ladder to access, introducing the hazard of falling from height? Is there another way you could design features to reduce hazards?
Can the building be safely demolished?
For example, we have stopped using asbestos due to the unacceptable health risk to workers, especially when asbestos is cut, removed or destroyed.
Where to find more guidance
WorkSafe has developed a ‘Health and Safety by Design’ good practice guideline. It includes information on how the HSWA applies to designers, as well as guidance on the principles and considerations of designing with health and safety in mind. The case studies provided mainly focus on infrastructure, however the key principles are transferable to any type of design and can add value to your practice. The guideline can be downloaded for free from worksafe.govt.nz .
This article is an excerpt from Codewords Issue 91. Reading Codewords articles that are relevant to your licence class is a mandatory requirement for Licensed Building Practitioners. These questions can be answered through the LBP portal, online on the Under Construction website or recorded on the magazine, then provided at the time of renewal.

Houses built on slopes performed poorly in recent earthquakes. Now BRANZ experiments have shown how to retrofit pre-1960s timber house foundations to improve seismic performance
Many New Zealand houses have been built – and continue to be built – with timber foundations on sloping sites.
Observations from the Christchurch earthquake of 2011, and the subsequent BRANZ House Condition Survey, showed that houses on these sites tended to perform poorly. There is a need to improve the design of these to ensure greater resilience.
More resilient houses will mean a greater opportunity for residents to remain in their houses following a major earthquake – an important consideration in the aftermath of such an event.
Differing stiffness causes problems
The problem arises because the uphill foundation of these types of houses usually consists of a squat foundation wall, whereas the downhill foundation is a tall structure of piles or poles. The uphill edge, therefore, has a stiff foundation under lateral loading, and the downhill edge has a flexible foundation.
Under earthquake action across the slope, there is potential for large displacements on the tall flexible foundation structure on the downslope edge of the building, causing it to twist about the squatter, stiffer uphill foundation (Figure 1).
The deflections from the twisting action adds to the lateral displacement, potentially resulting in a progressive rotational failure. This difference in stiffness and the potential torsional problem is not addressed in NZS 3604:2011 Timber-framed buildings , where only the foundation’s strength is considered, nor in a specific engineering design if only strength is considered.
Figure 1: Twisting of floor on hillside under earthquake action
Four different foundations tested
To shed light on this issue, BRANZ partnered with Victoria University of Wellington to conduct an experimental study, jointly funded by the Building Research Levy and EQC. Four tests were carried out on representative foundations on a sloping site on a farm close to BRANZ, just north of Wellington. Scala penetrometer testing on the sloping site used for the test established that the soil bearing properties closely approximated the lower limit of ‘good ground’, as defined by NZS 3604:2011 .
Each test specimen consisted of a timber-framed plywood-clad floor of approximately 2.4m across the slope by 4.8m up and down the slope. All four floors had a concrete foundation wall supporting the upper edge and piles at the lower edge. See Figure 2 (main photo) for the floors under construction:
Floor 1: Standard NZS 3604:2011 construction using braced piles at the lower edge of the floor.
Floor 2: Standard NZS 3604:2011 construction using ordinary piles.
Floor 3: Typical pre-1960s construction using concrete piles and jack studs with cut between braces (see Figure 3a).
Floor 4: Typical pre-1960s construction using concrete piles and jack studs and clad with horizontal timber weatherboards (see Figure 3b).
Figure 3: Typical pre-1960s downhill subfloor wall construction
Weight added and shaking begins
Dead weight was added to the floor of each specimen to replicate the true mass of the superstructure associated with the supporting foundation.
Preliminary tests were carried out to measure the stiffness and natural frequency of each floor, then each was excited dynamically by a counter-rotating shaker to simulate the effects of an earthquake. The shaker had the capability to apply lateral and frequency. The displacement of the specimen was monitored along with the displacement response of the structure with respect to the ground.
Piles rocked noticeably
It was clear that all pile foundations rocked quite noticeably under the lateral loading, creating gaps between soil and concrete at the end of the tests. This was also observed in the foundations of some Christchurch buildings after the earthquakes.
The NZS 3604:2011 floors performed overall as expected, although the rocking of the foundations was a little greater than anticipated. Apart from the rocking of the concrete foundations, the floors deflected back and forth in time with the shaker. There was twisting in the plan of the floor, because of the unevenness in height of the foundations caused by the ground slope. There was some buckling of the diagonal brace, and movement at the brace connections to the piles.
Retrofitting improved performance
During the shaking, deflections of the pre-1960s floors increased, almost to the point of imminent collapse in one test. To address this, the pre-1960s foundations were retrofitted to improve their performance:
Both floors 3 and 4 had infill concrete foundation walls cast between the existing piles (see Figure 4a and 4b).
Floor 3 had all frame joints strengthened with the installation of galvanised brackets at all stud-to-plate joints (Figure 4a).
Floor 4 had sheets of 9mm plywood nailed to the inside face of the jack stud wall (see Figure 4b).
These retrofit measures greatly improved the floor performance.
Under the initial shaking, the pre-1960s floor structures proved to be quite flexible. However, after retrofitting, they stiffened up considerably, as anticipated by the measurements taken in the preliminary tests. Figure 5 shows the relative stiffness and the increase in relative stiffness in both pre-1960s foundations.
Figure 4: Pre-1960s downhill subfloor wall construction after strengthening
Figure 5: Change in relative stiffness of pre-1960s downhill walls after strengthening
Results can be applied to houses
A substantial increase in performance to the pre-1960s foundations was achieved by the retrofit solutions.
The infill foundation walls were very effective at stabilising the isolated pile foundations, although these could be difficult to construct on sites with limited underfloor access.
Nominal reinforcement was used in the wall, together with grouted in starters to all the piles. In the interests of buildability, starters could be reduced to end piles only as the centre piles are book-ended by foundation walls on each side.
The ply sheeting was very straightforward to install, as were the extra connectors on the jack stud braces. All solutions are likely to be inexpensive for most residential foundations.

Sealants play a critical role in making joints weathertight and allowing movement. It is important to get the application right
The sealant needs to keep joints closed during repeated movement – for example, as wall claddings heat/expand and cool/shrink over 24 hours. To do this, there needs to be good side adhesion and the correct width-to-depth ratio of sealant in a joint.
The four key steps to ensuring effective sealant performance are:
Choosing the right sealant for the job.
Good joint preparation.
Priming the joint substrate.
Applying the sealant correctly.
Many sealant problems come from poor preparation of joints and priming, and poor sealant application. This often leaves the sealant too shallow.
As always, follow the manufacturer’s use and application recommendations. There is little to gain and a lot to lose in trying to save money through buying a cheap, inappropriate product or skimping on application.
The correct choice of sealant depends partly on the material. For example, lightweight claddings may experience faster/greater temperature changes and rapid/larger movements.
This creates more stress on sealant bond surfaces. Sealants with higher rapid movement capability or elasticity are best in these cases.
Before applying sealant, clean joint surfaces to remove dust, crumbly material, oil and grease. Repair damaged edges. The joint must be dry during sealant application.
Priming is often necessary for good adhesion and a durable sealant bond, especially for:
Figure 1 – click to expand
High-movement joints.
Joints exposed to high weathering/ moisture.
Locations that are difficult to access.
Application
To be effective, the sealant must:
Completely fill the joint to the right depth.
Be fully in contact with the joint sides for the full sealant depth.
Not adhere to the back of the joint.
Have no air trapped in it.
A bond breaker, such as tape, to small joints in thin claddings or a PEF backing rod to larger joints (Figure 1) can help control sealant depth and ensure only side adhesion occurs. This allows the sealant to stretch more easily.
Mask joint edges and apply sealant within the time noted on the primer container. Push the gun in the direction the sealant is being applied (see image) to force sealant into the joint, then tool for a smooth finish.
Tooling helps force sealant into the joint, ensures sealant wets the joint sides, brings air to the surface and gives the correct contour.
Use the manufacturer’s recommended solution to lubricate the tool and prevent sealant sticking to it. Remove masking tape after tooling.
Remember that some gaps must be left open, chiefly for ventilation and drying in a wall assembly. These include:
At the base of cavities – a cavity closure or open perpends in brick veneer.
At the top of brick veneer – every third perpend (one course down) left open, or a 5mm gap to the soffit.
Under brick sills more than 2.4m wide (open perpends).
Across the face of a sill tray flashing when windows are installed in direct-fixed cladding.
In both direct-fixed and cavity claddings between the base of the cladding and: a head flashing across openings. a horizontal joint flashing.
a head flashing across openings.
a horizontal joint flashing.

Construction work can be messy, particularly when you’re dealing with sealants, adhesives and expanding foams. Generally, the sooner any spilt substance is removed, the easier it is to clean up, but make sure you use the right solvent
The secret to successful removal of spilt construction substances is understanding their composition and characteristics and using the correct solvent for the particular substance.
Stay safe during use
Before using sealants, adhesives or expanding foams, you should be familiar with the product’s material safety data sheet. This is provided by the manufacturer and contains information about the product including handling, hazards, precautions to take and dealing with spills.
Construction substances and the solvents used to clean up and remove them are often strong chemicals that must be handled and disposed of with care. Always follow the manufacturer’s instructions for handling and use. General precautions taken during their use include:
Using personal protective equipment (PPE).
Using a respirator when recommended to do so by the manufacturer.
Ensuring that spaces are well ventilated.
Latex and silicone sealants
There are two categories of sealants – acrylic or latex and silicone:
Latex sealants are typically used for filling gaps between the wall or ceiling and trims, where the sealant is not frequently exposed to water and where painting may be required.
Silicone sealants provide a waterproof barrier, so they are typically used around baths, showers, sinks and toilets. They also have reasonably good resistance to weathering and UV and can be used in a range of exterior applications.
Removing latex sealant residue
Latex sealants clean up well with water so spills should be wiped up immediately with a damp cloth.
Once hardened, the only way to remove residual latex sealant is by scraping. Apply heat (depending on the substrate, use a heat gun or hairdryer or pour on hot water) to soften the sealant and make removal easier.
Removing silicone sealant residue
Silicone sealant residue should also be removed as soon as it is spilt, as it is difficult to remove once it has cured. Depending on the surface, a cloth dipped in rubbing alcohol (isopropyl alcohol), methylated spirits (also referred to as denatured alcohol) or mineral turpentine may be used to remove residual sealant before it has cured. Before applying any solvent, always spot test on an inconspicuous part of the substrate.
Once sealant has cured, the first step is to scrape off as much residual sealant as possible using a scraper or putty knife. How to remove the remaining residual sealant depends on the substrate:
For non-porous surfaces such as metal, glass, plastics: wipe over the residual sealant with a cloth or sponge soaked in mineral turpentine or methylated spirits. The solvent will soften the sealant, making it easier to scrape off. If the solvent used is mineral turpentine, wash the area with mild detergent and warm water once the sealant has been removed.
For porous surfaces such as concrete, timber and brick: use a heat gun or hot water (concrete and brick only) to soften the sealant. Once softened, the residual sealant can be scraped off. Wipe the area with a cloth dipped in rubbing alcohol to remove any remaining residue if required. An alternative for concrete is to soak a cloth in rubbing alcohol and place on the residual sealant. Leave for several hours or overnight until the sealant has softened and can be scraped off. Dab on more rubbing alcohol as necessary to keep the sealant soft while scraping.
For carpet: scrape up as much sealant as possible, then dab rubbing alcohol onto the remaining sealant, working it through the carpet fibres with your fingers while wearing gloves. Leave for a few minutes, then dab off using a damp cloth and warm water. Wash the carpet using mild detergent and warm water to remove the rubbing alcohol if required.
Removing construction adhesive residue
Residual construction adhesive should also be wiped up as soon as possible using rubbing alcohol, white vinegar or a proprietary adhesive remover. Once dry, it becomes very difficult to remove.
To remove construction adhesive once it has dried, scrape off as much as possible using a scraper or putty knife. On timber, take care not to gouge the scraper into the timber. Removal of the remaining residual adhesive depends on the substrate:
For non-porous surfaces such as metal, glass, tiles and some plastics: soften the adhesive using rubbing alcohol or white vinegar, or by heating. Take care not to overheat glass or plastic surfaces. Scrape off the softened adhesive, then wipe with a cloth dipped in mineral turpentine to remove any remaining residue. Wash the area using mild detergent and warm water to remove any mineral turpentine.
For concrete: pour boiling water onto the adhesive and leave for several minutes to allow it to soften. It can then be scraped or scrubbed off.
For timber flooring and decking, and granite, marble and engineered stone benchtops: acetone may be used but must be used cautiously. Always first test the substrate in an inconspicuous location with a small amount of acetone. If there is no damage to the substrate, dab a small amount of acetone on the dried adhesive to soften it, then gently rub or scrape the area to remove the adhesive.
Removing construction adhesive from carpet
To remove construction adhesive from carpet before it has dried, use paper towels or cloths to remove as much as possible. Dab the residual adhesive with a cloth soaked in white vinegar or rubbing alcohol. Rinse the cloth in warm water and repeat until the adhesive has been removed.
Alternatively, use a proprietary adhesive remover but test a small section of the carpet in an inconspicuous location first to ensure that the remover will not damage the carpet. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions to remove the adhesive.
Adhesive that has dried onto the carpet fibres will generally need to be cut out.
Removing polyurethane foam insulation residue
Use acetone to dissolve uncured polyurethane foam by dabbing or wiping the substrate with a cloth dipped in acetone, then rub the area to remove the foam. Always first test the substrate in an inconspicuous location with a small amount of acetone.
Acetone will not work on cured polyurethane foam, so once it has cured, the polyurethane foam must be scraped or sanded off.

This article, the first in a two-part series, looks at how to overcome some of the challenges cold weather presents to concreters
We are fortunate in New Zealand to live in a moderate climate, which means we can build through most of the year. However, morning frosts during winter are common in many places (although they’re usually followed by a sunny day).
So, with winter upon us, it’s worth refreshing our memories about some of the issues associated with winter concreting. NZS 3109 Concrete Construction provides a definition of unfavourable cold conditions when concrete shall not be placed. These are:
When the ground is frozen.
At temperatures below 5°C, with temperature descending.
At temperatures below 2°C, with temperature ascending.
Let’s consider what happens to concrete at 0°C. If concrete is frozen before it sets, the hydration of the cement is suspended – partly because the water within the mix freezes and expands, preventing the reaction from continuing. If the temperature is raised and the concrete vibrated to remove pores created by ice, hydration should continue, which will produce satisfactory concrete.
This only remains true if the concrete is re-vibrated after the ice has thawed. However, if the concrete has set, but not reached sufficient strength, freezing can result in internal cracking and loss of strength. If the freezing only occurs on the surface, it may result in delamination. After concrete has attained strength of approximately 3.5 MPa, it is usually considered strong enough to resist a freeze-thaw cycle.
The requirements of NZS 3109 are there to give some protection against the potential freezing of concrete before it has attained sufficient strength.
“If concrete is frozen before it sets, the hydration of the cement is suspended
The best solution is to understand the fundamental principles of concreting in the cold, so that the most appropriate solution can be applied to your project. The following are some general comments that are worth considering:
Never place concrete on frozen ground. In New Zealand, it should be possible to wait until the ground temperature rises. Alternatively, the ground can be protected overnight with straw or a similar material to prevent freezing.
Use air-entrained concrete. The advantage of air entrainment is that it gives the concrete superior freeze/thaw resistance when it has reached sufficient strength. The concrete will still need to be protected from freezing until it reaches at least 3.5 MPa.
Consider the use of set accelerators, and/or HE cement. These will decrease the time to final set, meaning the concrete can be finished and potentially protected earlier. When the concrete is reinforced, it is recommended that non-chloride accelerators are used.
Be aware that accelerators have limited effectiveness when mix temperatures are below 5-8°C. Also, be aware that overdosing with some set accelerators can in fact retard set, so ensure that the dose rate is that recommended by the manufacturer.
There is a tendency in some areas to add set accelerators simply because it is winter, rather than based on the expected temperatures during placing and finishing. We can get very warm, low-humidity days in winter. The indiscriminate use of accelerators can lead to problems with premature setting or plastic cracking.
“Understand the fundamental principles of concreting in the cold, so that the most appropriate solution can be applied to your project
Protect the freshly placed concrete. In winter, there can be large changes in ambient day and night temperatures. This can lead to restrained early thermal contraction. The use of early entry saw cuts, or tooled joints, can prevent the formation of ugly random cracking.
Some cracking observed in winter suggests that the top surface had chilled relative to the body of the concrete, resulting in random surface cracking. Although the insulation value of polythene is negligible, covering with polythene can minimise the wind chill effect and prevent this type of cracking. If freezing conditions are expected, and the concrete is unlikely to have attained a strength of 3.5 MPa, use insulation.
Prevent thermal shock. If temperatures are cold and the concrete is warm, there is a risk that the removal of formwork can result in surface cracking. A temperature differential of 20°C or more is commonly quoted as the temperature differential at which this phenomenon can occur. Always follow the minimum formwork stripping times specified in NZS 3109 .
Use warm materials to make the concrete. The use of hot water and aggregates that have been stored in bins can elevate concrete mix temperatures, resulting in a faster setting time. Talk to your local ready-mixed concrete supplier for options that are practical in your area. Never use water above 70°C, and be aware of the safety requirements of using hot water on a construction site.
Do not use unventilated heaters. The CO 2 given off by some heaters can react with the concrete surface, producing a dusty, weak surface. Always make sure the exhaust gases are ventilated, and do not aim the burner directly at the concrete. With some simple precautions, it is relatively easy to obtain high-quality concrete all year round.

When builders are on site to carry out home renovations or repairs, it is a good time to suggest strengthening the property’s earthquake resistance with actions ranging from removing chimneys to securing the foundations
You only have to look at recent events to know that natural hazards are a fact of life in New Zealand.
Fortunately, potential building hazards don’t need to translate into disaster scenarios. Some seismic improvements, such as replacing heavy tile roofs with new lightweight roofs, are extremely effective but relatively expensive. There are cheaper cost-effective steps that can be taken to make homes safer and stronger for when events like damaging earthquakes occur.
Cost-effective alongside existing work
Some work can be undertaken by anyone and other work by confident DIYers. However, much of the work with the most positive impact in an earthquake requires the skills of a building professional. Doing this at the same time as other work will be more cost-effective and time-efficient for a homeowner.
Here are some key actions that can be recommended to homeowners when building works are planned to be carried out on site.
Removing brick and concrete chimneys
From the time we first built chimneys on New Zealand homes, earthquakes have been removing them. The magnitude 8.2 Wairarapa earthquake in 1855 is estimated to have damaged most chimneys in Wellington.
Thousands of chimneys also collapsed or were damaged during the 2010 and 2011 Canterbury earthquakes. Certain types of chimneys pose a real risk to the safety of people and can cause significant damage to homes during a large seismic event.
The most hazardous chimney types are those that extend above the roofline and are constructed from unreinforced brick or concrete masonry. These are most commonly found on homes built before the 1970s.
Look for chimneys that are twisting, leaning or showing signs of cracking, as these require immediate attention.
Some options for making chimneys safer:
If the chimney is no longer used, the best option is to remove it down to the floor level, but an alternative is to remove it down to the ceiling line.
If the chimney is still in use, a portion of the hazardous section above the roofline or ceiling line can be replaced with a lighter-weight metal flue.
The most cost-effective option is likely to be the addition of extra bracing in the roof space between ceiling rafters or ceiling joists to reduce the risk of a brittle failure or partial overturning of a chimney structure in a large seismic event. This will help protect the home’s occupants from debris falling into the living space. However, injuries could still occur from the chimney collapsing to the outside of a home, and the home could be damaged.

Securing the dwelling to the foundations
Many Kiwi homes built prior to the current Building Code era do not have a connection between the timber frame superstructure and foundation system. This practice came from a time when the seismic risk associated with residential dwellings was not well understood. Now, because of experience from recent seismic events, we are aware of the risk of building movement off its supporting foundation system.
When a dwelling subfloor is accessible, there are several actions that could be taken to connect the superstructure to the foundations:
Fix timber or concrete piles to a dwelling subfloor using the details in NZS 3604:2011 Timber-framed buildings (see Figure 1).
Fix framed subfloor walls to a foundation system with bottom-plate anchors. The widespread existence of unreinforced perimeter foundation elements means a careful assessment is required to check if the concrete substrate is in adequate condition to receive such an anchor.
NZS 3604:2011 provides several details but usually it would be preferable to engage a structural engineer who will be aware of the benefits and risks of altering the load path of the superstructure through the foundation system to the supporting soil.
Adding bracing to foundations
Sloping sites or hillside sections can be prone to dwelling foundation movement during seismic events.
Retrofitting lateral bracing elements in the subfloor can significantly improve foundation performance. Diagonal timber bracing installed between piles, or piles and bearers where ground clearance is above 600mm, is particularly beneficial.
Cases of floor deformation and partial rotation of singularly cantilevered timber poles with shallow footings is well-documented following large lateral movements.
It is helpful to refer to NZS 3604:2011 subfloor bracing configurations when considering the best approach with retrofitting elements.
Adding wall lining bracing
When a wall lining has been removed, there may be an opportunity to upgrade the bracing configuration and performance.
Dwellings constructed prior to the plasterboard era rely on timber
members to resist lateral loads transmitted into the foundation. Examples of these bracing systems comprise let-in braces, singular or double diagonal braces or fully horizontal matched plank linings (see Figure 2). BRANZ Study Report SR305 Bracing ratings for non-proprietary bracing walls has more details.
The horizontal loads will eventually transfer to these timber bracing elements but only after the lining material is deformed and displaced to a point of cracking and failure. While it is beneficial to replace lath and plaster or similarly brittle lining materials, adding modern plasterboard bracing will assist in transferring loads to the foundation.
An NZS 3604:2011 wall configuration may be required to correctly transfer loads along wall geometry safely to the foundation.
Some early New Zealand colonial dwellings will have balloon wall framing. These require the addition of dwangs at ceiling level to create an equivalent top plate (and likewise for bottom plates) to enable the installation of modern sheet bracing.
A structural engineer can assess the condition of the wall framing connections and produce a bracing plan based on values in SR305.

The past decade has produced seven of our 10 warmest years on record and, by 2040, the number of days above 25°C is predicted to rise by 40% or more in some areas. That could mean an extra month of hot weather. Designing effective shade devices on homes will be crucial to keeping them cool
Our climate is getting warmer and BRANZ research over recent decades has found our houses are following suit. That’s a combined result of increased airtightness, higher-performing thermal insulation, increased areas of glazing, fewer or smaller eaves and changing occupant behaviour.
Planning to prevent overheating should be part of the earliest stages of design. Things to consider:
• Building orientation that takes advantage of cooling breezes. • Passive design options such as cross-ventilation and stack ventilation, where fresh cool air enters a building at a lower level and hot, stale air is naturally expelled at a higher level (eg, skylights). • Shade devices such as eaves and louvres. • Window placement, size and glazing appropriate to the local climate and orientation. • Using thermal modelling tools to identify designs with optimal indoor temperatures.
All about eaves
Eaves are the most effective approach to keep midsummer sun out but allow midwinter sun in on the northern aspect. Eaves and shading devices should be designed specifically for the location.
The length of Aotearoa New Zealand means that differences in sun angles (see Figure 1) do not allow a one-size-fits-all approach for the whole of the country.
NIWA’s online tool Solarview produces custom sun path diagrams for specific locations, showing the sun’s location in the sky at any point during the day and throughout the year (see Figure 2). This data can be used to design eaves or other fixed overhangs.
Figure 1: Midday sun angles for midsummer and midwinter (northern aspect only) are very different around New Zealand, so eaves must be designed specifically for the location
Calculating the depth for eaves
Optimising a design to provide healthy and comfortable indoor temperatures is ideally done with computer modelling software (see BRANZ Bulletin 684 Thermal modelling tools for houses) . There is also a relatively simple two-step calculation that can show the approximate eaves dimensions for different window heights at different latitudes. The first step considers the depth required to keep out midsummer sun, while the second considers the height required to admit midwinter sun.
Take the height (H) from the windowsill to the eave (Figure 2) and multiply this by the Fheight factor for the closest location (Table 1). Using Auckland as an example, if the distance between the windowsill and eave is 2m, the calculation is 2.0 x 0.24 = 0.48. Therefore, the eave overhang should be approximately 480mm horizontally to minimise the impact of the summer sun. If the windows go down to floor level, the calculation is around 2.6 x 0.24 = 0.624. That is 624mm (or it could be rounded to 600mm). These calculations are very close to the figures calculated in ‘Combating overheating without using energy’ in Build 121.
To ensure that the window admits winter sun, calculate the required height (D in Figure 2), which is H x Fshade. Using Christchurch as an example, the calculation for full-length north-facing windows is 2.6 x 0.15 = 0.390. The minimum distance between the top of the window and the bottom of the eave overhang should be 390mm, which could be rounded to 400mm.
Glazing
Window placement, size and glazing specification have an enormous impact on the comfort levels inside a home. Large west-facing windows are problematic in the early evening because the sun can be both hot and relatively low in the sky, so eaves are not fully effective.
Where such windows are wanted, perhaps to benefit from a view, movable louvres or indoor shade options, such as shaderoller blinds, may be more effective than eaves. BRANZ also encourages new-home designers to carefully consider the solar heat gain coefficient (SHGC) of glazing to reduce the risk of overheating. You can find more details in ‘ Solar heat gain coefficient for windows’ in Build 189 .
Further information about designing for shade generally can be found in BRANZ Bulletin 656 Designing to avoid houses overheating.

Once the home is built, the next step is to paint or coat the timber cladding. It is important that this is carried out correctly, to ensure long-term durability and a great appearance
Timber weatherboards have been used to clad New Zealand homes for generations. They are a proven cladding made from a durable natural resource that is flexible and lightweight and can be easily worked and finished to a high standard.
Similarly, we have painted our houses for generations. Whether this has been done by home handypeople or professional painters, painting and paint systems are a critical component in protecting what is probably our most valuable asset.
THINK ABOUT THE PAINT SYSTEM
Unfortunately, painting is frequently considered to be the final beautification process – after all the sweat, hard work and potentially tears of the construction project have taken place. This means its importance can sometimes be overlooked.
Often people will spend longer agonising over colours than paying additional attention to the details of the paint system and ensuring the paint actually does what it was designed to do – to protect an investment for many years.
FOLLOW MANUFACTURERS’ INSTRUCTIONS
Regardless of type, all cladding products made by reputable manufacturers have care, handling and finishing instruction details that are either supplied with the product or available online. Making sure these instructions are adhered to is paramount to ensuring products perform as they were designed to.
The most prevalent timber weatherboard in use today is a finger-jointed treated and preprimed product, manufactured from radiata pine. Some manufacturers use different factory priming and sealing systems before getting their product to market.
Some producers provide an extra factory-applied top coating service, which ensures surface uniformity and that a high-quality consistent film builds. Factory top-coating services save time and labour on site, provide additional board protection and cover the full face of the weatherboard.
GETTING THE BEST RESULTS
For best results, premium acrylic top coats of an appropriate colour – usually lighter – and suitable gloss level are recommended for use with timber weatherboards. The quality and thickness of the paint system – especially of top coats – have a significant impact on the long-term aesthetic performance of weatherboards.
Coating thickness or dry film thickness is relative to top coat application spread rates. These are clearly indicated on paint containers and paint company data sheets.
All premium paint brands offer relatively consistent application rate specifications, but note they typically state minimum levels. Not achieving at least the required minimum levels of top coat dry film thickness may result in premature weathering and breakdown of the overall paint system, causing early repaints and needless additional maintenance to properties.
For example, highly exposed homes adjacent to beaches with sand and salt spray may need additional coats and maintenance to ensure the optimal level of protection and desired aesthetic for longer-term periods.
KEEP UP THE MAINTENANCE
Basic maintenance of home exteriors is often overlooked. All claddings, including timber weatherboards, benefit from a gentle wash, especially under eaves and overhangs. Washing will remove marine salts and other contaminants and should be done at least annually.
TRADE PROFFESIONALS
Using an experienced painter to prepare and apply exterior paint to timber weatherboards is an advantage. Often, they will have extended relationships with professionals in paint companies and cladding providers to give additional advice, ensuring best results.
TREAT WELL FOR GOOD PERFORMANCE
Timber weatherboards are a timeless New Zealand cladding. Quality New Zealand-produced weatherboards – prepared, painted and maintained to specification – will perform well in our harsh environment, giving generations of performance and aesthetic appeal.

Strict regulations ensure the safety of children around swimming pools by requiring the installation of suitable barriers to restrict access. BRANZ outlines the requirements and where to find them
We enjoy an enviable outdoor lifestyle in New Zealand and, as our climate continues to warm, the number of residential swimming pools will probably continue to increase accordingly.
Keeping children safe around pools
Along with the enjoyment of these pools comes the legal obligation and responsibility for safeguarding children from the risks of these fun-filled features. This responsibility includes restricting unsupervised access by children – especially those under five years of age – to residential swimming pools.
The guideline for pool barriers was traditionally the Fencing of Swimming Pools Act 1987, but this was repealed by the Building (Pools) Amendment Act 2016, which inserted new provisions into the Building Act 2004.
Building Code clause F9
The Building (Pools) Amendment Act created a new Building Code clause F9 Means of restricting access to residential pools . This includes F9/AS1 , which provides the Acceptable Solution for swimming pool barriers in general, and F9/AS2 , which provides the Acceptable Solution for pool covers.
Clause F9 of the Building Code relates directly to section 162C (1) of the Building Act, which requires all residential pools to have barriers to restrict access by unsupervised children under five years of age. This section applies to pools constructed before the amendment to the Building Act and those built after in compliance with clause F9. Barriers also need to be maintained so they continue to be effective.
Barriers needed for all pools over 400mm deep
Pool barriers are required for all swimming pools that have a capacity to hold more than 400mm depth of water. A pool fence must enclose the ‘immediate pool area’ (that is, the pool itself along with a confined area around the pool where activities related to or involving the pool take place).
Activities not related to or involving the pool must be kept outside the pool area. These include vegetable gardens, clotheslines and children’s play areas.
Using the immediate pool area to access the house from the property boundary or to gain access to other parts of the property from the house would, in most cases, conflict with the definition of immediate pool area.
A compliant pool barrier can be a fence or other forms of construction, such as a concrete block wall. Specifically designed frameless toughened glass barriers are growing in popularity.
The wall of a house or other building can also form part of the barrier to the immediate pool area or may enclose the total immediate pool area – for example, an indoor pool.
Pool barrier requirements
Dedicated pool barriers not on a property boundary must be no less than 1200mm high, measured from the finished floor or ground level outside the pool barrier.
Pool barriers may be angled no more than 15° from vertical and must only slope away from the pool. Any rods, rails or wires forming part of a pool barrier that are not vertical must be a minimum of 900mm apart vertically to restrict climbing by toddlers or children.
There must be no openings in the pool barrier that a 100mm diameter sphere can pass through.
Acceptable pool barriers
Acceptable ways of constructing pool barriers that are not on a property boundary are shown in Figure 1 of F9/AS1 and include solid panel type barriers, fencing with vertical members that include horizontal structural members, horizontal fencing and metal rail fencing.
F9/AS1 Figure 1 illustrates specific ground clearances, overall barrier heights and horizontal and vertical spacing requirements.
Consider THE space immediately outside
Determining the required barrier height is dependent on the characteristics of the space immediately outside the pool barrier. Changes in level adjacent to the barrier or the presence of climbable objects, buildings or other structures may enable a child to scale the barrier.
F9/AS1 Figure 2 shows acceptable methods for evaluating the impact of these ground features or objects outside the pool barrier but within 1200mm of the top of the barrier.
Any projections or indentations on the outside face of a pool barrier must not have a horizontal projection from the face of the pool barrier greater than 10mm, unless they are at least 900mm apart vertically.
Property boundaries
If a pool barrier is located on a property boundary, it must be at least 1800mm high measured from the ground level on the pool side and located at least 1m horizontally from the edge of the pool.
There must be no openings that a 100mm sphere could pass through and requirements regarding any rods, rails or wires and projections and indentations must be as per pool barriers surrounding the immediate pool area.
The pool owner must ensure there are no ground features, plantings, buildings or other structures that enable a child to scale the pool barrier on the boundary of the property.
When a building wall is part of a pool barrier
When a wall of a building, such as the home, forms part of the pool barrier, there are specific requirements for openings.
Where there is a window that can open above and within 2.4m vertically of the immediate pool area, the window must have either:
The lower edge of the opening no less than 1m above the floor level inside the building with no projections underneath of more than 10mm. A restrictor limiting the size of the opening to prevent passage of a 100mm sphere.
A permanently fixed screen preventing the passage of a 100mm sphere.
F2/AS1 requires safety glass for glazing within 2m vertically and 2m horizontally of walking surfaces alongside pools.
F9/AS1 also limits the size of any doors accessing the immediate pool area to no greater than 1m in width. These doors must have a self-closing device or an audible alarm and a self-latching device at least 1500mm above finished floor level that is released manually.
A sign reading ’ Swimming pool. Close the door. ’ must be fixed adjacent to the door handle, as per F9/AS1 section 4.2.2 (d). Specific functional and performance requirements for the self-closing device and door alarm are also noted in F9/AS1 sections 4.2.3, 4.2.4 and 4.2.5.
Alternative compliance methods
These are Acceptable Solutions for residential pool barriers, but designers should be familiar with the New Zealand Building Code Handbook, which explains alternative methods of achieving compliance. Designers using F9/AS1 should also check for amendments on a regular basis.
Remember, pool barrier requirements are not a substitute for the presence of an adult to supervise children under five years of age using swimming pools.

TITLE   : HOLD-DOWN FIXINGS

BRANZ regularly receives queries about hold-down fixings to the exterior walls of timber-framed buildings. This overview sets out the fixing requirements in NZS 3604:2011 for resistance to uplift for the various framing members
In high wind conditions, roofs are subject to powerful uplift forces. Both the roof and its framing must be securely fixed, so the uplift forces travel down through the building structure to the foundations.
Where a roof is supported by a lintel over a window or door, it is critical that the load is properly transferred around the opening.
However, it can seem strange to have multiple straps and other hold-down fixings on exterior walls of timber-framed buildings where there are openings in the wall and none to other walls where there are no openings. BRANZ is often asked if this is correct?
NZS 3604:2011 is an Acceptable Solution
NZS 3604:2011 Timber-framed buildings provides solutions for resistance to wind uplift for the different parts of the building by tying the building structure together with fixings, including bolts, nails and metal straps. NZS 3604:2011 is an Acceptable Solution to Building Code clause B1 Structure.
NZS 3604:2011 is a stand-alone solution, so if you are using this pathway to show Building Code compliance, it is important to use the solutions in the standard.
Clause 2.4.4.1 relates to nails generally, and Table 2.2 is a reference guide for fixing requirements and describes the types and capacity of fixings.
Roof fixings
The roofing must be secured to the tile battens or purlins in accordance with the manufacturer’s requirements. E2/AS1 also has information on fixings and layout for some roof materials.
The fixings/connection for roof members are specified in NZS 3604:2011 Tables 10.1 to 10.18. Specific requirements for truss fixings will be stated on the truss layout plans provided by the truss supplier.
Fixings in walls
Walls are covered in NZS 3604:2011 clause 8.8.6, Table 8.19 and Figure 8.12:
For top plates, see clause 8.7.6, Table 8.18 and Figure 8.12.
For lintels, see clauses 8.6.1.7 and 8.6.1.8, Table 8.14 and Figure 8.12.
Openings in walls
NZS 3604:2011 paragraphs 8.6.1.7 and 8.6.1.8 cover where there are openings in a wall. Where a lintel supports a rafter or truss (and depending on the wind zone, lintel span and loaded dimension), it must be fixed against uplift as per Table 8.14.
This includes using 25 × 1mm galvanised steel straps to secure the lintel to the trimming stud and the trimming stud to a floor joist or solid blocking as shown in Figure 8.12.
Each strap must be fixed with 6/30 × 2.5mm nails into both the lintel and the trimming stud. Alternatively, a fixing with a minimum 7.5kN capacity in tension along the line of the trimming stud may be used.
Fixing the bottom of walls
Fixing the trimming stud to the floor joist, continuous boundary joist or solid blocking of a timber-framed floor applies to a single-storey building or to upper floor framing to the intermediate floor. Fixing is with a 25 × 1mm strap with 6/30 × 2.5mm nails into both the joist or solid blocking and the stud. Alternatively, a fixing providing a minimum of 7.5kN in tension may be used.
Where ground floor framing is on a concrete floor slab, the strapping is folded under the bottom plate and fixed to each side of the stud using 6/30 × 2.5mm nails. A proprietary anchor that meets the requirements of NZS 3604:2011 clause 7.5.12.3 or a cast-in bolt must fix the bottom plate to the slab within 150mm of the stud.
Proprietary fixings available
Proprietary fixings are available for all locations requiring to be secured against uplift. These include timber connectors, stud straps, stud anchors, cleats, bottom plate fixing anchors and hold-down brackets.
NZS 3604:2011 does not allow for plywood or any other wall lining, either to the exterior or the interior of the wall framing, to substitute for the connections required between the wall framing members to resist wind uplift forces. However, several proprietary solutions can provide for this.
Distribution of fixings can seem uneven
Complying with NZS 3604:2011 requirements to resist uplift generally results in numerous straps and fixings to the wall framing wherever there are openings for windows or doors. However, other parts of the wall where there are no openings may only have nail fixings.
This distribution of fixings may seem uneven, but the wind uplift forces transferred from the section of roof above the lintel to point loads at each end can be quite large, especially when the opening below the lintel is wide. These forces must then be transferred to the two trimmer studs (at each side of the opening), so higher capacity fixings are required than provided by nailing only. These concentrated forces must then be transferred to the ground via the connection at the base of the trimming stud. To do this, nail straps or other proprietary fixings are required.
Cheap to add more
By their nature, individual nail fixings are less precise than metal straps or proprietary fixings. It is better to be safe than sorry, and as hold-down metal straps and proprietary fixings are relatively inexpensive and easily fixed in place, it is reasonable to also use them elsewhere, even if not specifically required.
Finally, it is better to have a relatively even distribution of stiffness and connections around the perimeter and throughout a building. A similar distribution and spacing of hold-downs will homogenise the behaviour of the structure under extraordinary loadings such as storms or earthquakes.
These are minimums, you can do more
Remember, NZS 3604:2011 prescribes the minimum standards necessary to attain compliance. It should never be a barrier to designers and builders providing better options to the construction of the building, especially where the time and costs to do so are relatively minimal.

We’re not talking plasters or bandages – this article looks at how to achieve the best finish on cut timber
The end grain of cut timber is a vulnerable spot, where water can be more readily absorbed and rot can start if the timber remains wet. When you’re on site and making cuts to painted or stained timber that will be exposed to moisture – such as weatherboards, bargeboards and fascias – treating the cut the right way is crucial.
Under the New Zealand Building Code, claddings must be durable for at least 15 years with normal maintenance. Homeowners will naturally expect much longer than that.
NZS 3602:2003 Timber and wood-based products for use in building requires radiata pine weatherboards, external fascias and trims to be treated to hazard class H3.1 as a minimum, and protected with three coats of alkyd or acrylic paint.
These H3.1 treated timber products usually arrive on site pre-primed on all surfaces. After they are cut to length, cut ends must always be reprimed, preferably with two coating applications because of the greater porosity of timber end grain. Repriming after cutting is a requirement of NZS 3602:2003 (and also Acceptable Solution E2/AS1). Notches and holes cut in the timber should also be fully sealed.
Because primers have a short life, primed weatherboards not immediately installed may need repriming – check the supplier’s installation instructions for the maximum time primed surfaces can be exposed to the weather.
While sealing cut ends is especially important for H3.1 timber weatherboards and trims, it also applies to weatherboards made from H3.2 treated timber or cedar that are painted or stained, fibre-cement, compressed hardwood fibres and some other materials. Check the manufacturer’s requirements – they typically require cut ends to be sealed with an acrylic sealer. Some proprietary products (including H3.1 radiata pine products) require a proprietary sealant to be used on cut ends.
There are also treatment requirements for other types of cladding cut on site. For example, E2/AS1 requires that:
Where fibre-cement sheet claddings are cut on site, cut edges are sealed with paint including 100mm across the back face from each edge.
Where plywood sheet claddings are cut after treatment, the cut edges are brushed with a solution of 12.5% copper naphthenate in white spirits or mineral turpentine.
H5 TREATED TIMBER PILES
Timber piles must be durable for at least 50 years under the Building Code. Where piles are cut on site, whether cutting to length or notching and rebating, the cut ends must always be treated. The cut surface should be dry to the touch and then have a liberal application of timber treatment brushed on. Manufacturers will recommend treatment in their documentation, but it will usually be something like zinc naphthenate, TBTO or TBTN.
The cut ends of piles must not be placed in the ground. Some manufacturers go further and specify that cut ends should not be closer than 150mm or 300mm to the ground.
Product warranties may no longer apply if the requirements around treating cut ends are not followed.

New technologies, such as virtual and augmented reality, can play a strategic role in enhancing safety training. BRANZ looks at its potential for reducing workplace accidents and minimising unsafe behaviours
Virtual reality (VR) can immerse users in computer-generated simulations that closely resemble real-life experiences, allowing individuals to experience different training scenarios and witness the realistic consequences of unsafe behavior while working on a construction site or during emergencies such as fires or earthquakes.
In the past decade, as the price of VR equipment has dramatically decreased, many new VR training applications have been developed worldwide for construction workers and building occupants. In 2015, VR headsets were primarily found in university laboratories. From 2016 onward, the wider public was introduced to the technology, although it remained expensive and required a high-end computer. Today, standalone VR headsets can be purchased for less than $500 and no longer require an external computer, making them affordable for any construction company.
VR Training Requires Doing
Despite the early promise of VR applications in safety training, two key questions have remained: Is VR training more effective than traditional methods, and should we invest in this new technology? The digitalisation team at Massey University’s School of Built Environment ( builtenv.ac.nz/digitaltech ) has definitive answers to these questions. It analyzed over 50 scientific articles published between 2013 and 2021 and found that VR outperforms traditional safety training in terms of how much trainees learn and remember – even weeks or months later.
The reason? VR training allows people to learn by doing and making mistakes, in contrast to traditional training, which is passive – trainees are expected to listen to instructions only.
Augmented Reality Takes It a Step Further
Another emerging technology that can disrupt the safety training field is augmented reality (AR) – an advanced visualization technology that incorporates digital elements, such as characters, sound, and text, into views of the real world. These digital elements are often referred to as holograms. Currently, AR is used in vehicle reversing cameras and in smartphone games like Pokémon Go. The technology is becoming increasingly mature in both hardware and software.
The School of Built Environment digitalisation team recently published results of one of the first AR safety training studies. The research shows how holograms can be used to teach building occupants what to do if they spot a fire in a building. A hologram of a firefighter instructs trainees on the necessary steps to contain and report the fire, and ultimately evacuate the building. By testing this prototype, the research team demonstrated that AR safety training was more effective in increasing motivation and retention than equivalent traditional training.
Testing Long-Term Recall
The Massey University team is currently working on the development and testing of new safety training methods as part of a Marsden project funded by the Royal Society Te Apārangi. The project, titled “How much do they recall? Measuring the effect of safety training on human memory,” will assess how much people remember from safety training over the course of a year.
As with previous research, the project will compare VR and AR safety training with traditional methods, aiming to identify new solutions and evidence to enhance future safety training programs and regulations, ultimately saving lives.
What’s the difference?
Augmented reality (AR) augments your surroundings by adding digital elements to a live view. Virtual reality (VR) is a completely immersive experience that replaces a real-life environment with a simulated one.

Fresh concrete carries an expiry date – if you’re not well organised with the right skills and equipment, you could have a disaster on your hands!
T here is plenty to consider when laying a concrete floor slab; timing, the right amount of water and aftercare are three of the most crucial.
Once the concrete starts mixing, the clock is ticking! NZS 3104:2003 Specification for concrete production states that full discharge of concrete from ready-mix trucks shall be completed within 90 minutes after the commencement of mixing.
This is probably a little-known clause, but we all know that concrete will stiffen as the cement starts to ‘go off’, particularly in hot weather. The use of retarding admixtures in summer and accelerating admixtures in winter will help alleviate issues, but being unprepared for the concrete truck comes down to bad planning.
Preparation, mix and workmanship key
BRANZ Bulletin 498 Preparation for concrete floor slabs outlines key areas needing attention when preparing for a concrete pour. Also, the recent BRANZ Study Report 340 Revisiting concrete ground floor slabs concludes that good mix design and workmanship are the key to producing crack-free concrete.
Even though the concrete pour is typically carried out by a specialist subcontractor, it pays for the supervising contractor to be aware of the facts.
Issue of uncontrolled cracking
Uncontrolled cracking is undoubtedly the biggest issue with concrete floors and pavements.
As soon as the concrete starts to dry out, shrinkage commences and there is potential for cracking to occur given the low tensile strength of immature concrete. Water in the concrete mix is the biggest cause of shrinkage.
There needs to be just enough water to make the concrete workable, in order to place and compact it. Inevitably, around 7mm of shrinkage will occur over a 10m length of slab. If more water is added to increase the slump of the concrete and make it easier to place, this shrinkage could increase to 12mm in a 10m slab length.
Controlled addition of water
Did you know that NZS 3104:2003 allows the addition of water to the truck, provided it’s in a controlled manner – up to 10L/m 3 of concrete ?
This is because the concrete may dry out through evaporation from the truck, particularly during summer’s higher temperatures. This makes it hard to get the stiff concrete out of the truck, place it and fully compact it.
Also, where the transit time from the concrete plant to the site is considerable, slump loss may be an issue. Adding water is okay, but it must be a measured amount and with the agreement of the concrete plant.
Adding 10L/m 3 only represents around 5% of the total water content of concrete and replaces the water lost through evaporation. Adding water in an uncontrolled manner is inviting problems of high shrinkage and low strength.
Concrete needs early attention
Concrete is vulnerable until it has gained some strength. The hydration of cement is a chemical reaction affected by temperature and the presence of moisture. As soon as the fresh concrete starts to dry to the atmosphere, shrinkage will commence and strength gain will slow. The critical areas to focus on are finishing, curing, saw cutting and mesh placement.
Finishing
A slab is very exposed to the weather when being placed, finished and cured. Avoid rain, strong drying winds (particularly in spring), hot sunny conditions and large temperature drops overnight, as they can all cause cracking.
Download a localised weather forecast – some concrete suppliers offer this as part of their service. If conditions are unfavourable for concreting, delay the pour rather than taking a risk.
Curing
Curing ensures that the concrete does not dry out prematurely and gains strength from an early age. If the commencement of curing is delayed, you cannot make up for it by curing later – you will lose around 50% of the potential concrete strength.
Curing is achieved by flooding the concrete or sprinkling the entire surface. Alternatively, a plastic sheet can be laid on the surface and weighed down with sand or the like, so that wind cannot get under the sheet.
Curing should begin the day after pouring in summer, before the concrete surface has had a chance to dry out. Unfortunately, adequate curing is often ignored in practice – yet it is critical to achieving concrete strength gain and avoiding shrinkage cracking.
Saw cutting
NZS 3604:2011 Timber-framed buildings requires saw cutting – which creates weak links for shrinkage cracking to occur – to take place the day after pouring in summer and two days after pouring in winter (see Figure 1). This timing is critical, and the occurrence of uncontrolled cracking due to late saw cutting is far too common.
Once uncontrolled shrinkage cracks have formed, the saw-cut joints will not act as the weak link for shrinkage cracking to occur. Movement will always take place preferentially at the existing cracks.
Mesh placement
For slabs designed to NZS 3604:2011 , the spacing of saw-cut joints, shrinkage movement joints and location of the reinforcing mesh are all important in avoiding shrinkage cracking. The reinforcing mesh needs to be at 30mm cover to the top of the slab (see Figure 2). Its main function is to prevent shrinkage cracks occurring between saw-cut joints.
To ensure the mesh is at the correct height, support it on mesh chairs. The required reinforcing mesh required is grade 500E (seismic mesh) 2.27kg/m² welded wire mesh.
The maximum distance between saw-cut joints is 6m, and every fourth joint should be a free movement joint at a maximum spacing of 24m (see Figure 2).
Where parts of the floor are exposed, such as for a coloured or polished floor, the saw-cut spacing should be reduced to 5m.

Complying with the new requirements of clause H1 (the rules for thermal performance in housing in the New Zealand Building Code) for windows follows the previous process implemented in 2022 and 2023 – it’s just that the insulation values are now higher
I n the future, designing homes to reduce space heating and cooling needs will likely use a modelling method to determine their designed thermal performance. This will ensure that the best choices can be made to maximise the benefits of solar gain through glazing and minimise energy and carbon used for space heating and cooling with clever design.
Modelling method will be required
While the current modelling method allows for each home to be individually designed to obtain the best performance for that home – based on location, orientation and specific design elements – the schedule and calculation methods within clause H1 are still able to be used.
The calculation method allows trade-offs between the various insulated parts of buildings and can be used for individual homes or groups of similar homes with less than 40% window-to-wall area.
The schedule method specifies the R-values that windows must meet or exceed in Table E.1.1.1 (see Table 1) and can generally be used where windows make up 30% or less of the wall area – for specific details, see clause H1. There are at least four ways to use the schedule method, which are outlined here.
All four of these approaches are implementations of the schedule method and, along with producer statements, allow you to demonstrate compliance of your window systems with the requirements of clause H1 of the Building Code.
Table E.1.1.1
The easiest way to demonstrate compliance of new exterior windows for housing with the requirements of the revised H1 (thermal performance) is using Table E.1.1.1 of H1/VM1 . This allows you to look up the defined thermal performance value for a houselot of exterior joinery based on just the generic frame type and the thermal performance of the centre of glazing of the IGUs. To use this approach:
Identify the total window R-value (Rwindow) needed for your climate zone (see map on page 26) – either R0.46 for climate zones 1–4 (the North Island and top of the South Island) or R0.50 for climate zones 5–6 (the rest of the South Island).
Select the generic type of window/door frame from the four options of aluminium, thermally broken aluminium, timber or uPVC across the top of Table E.1.1.1.
Identify the required centre of glazing U-value (Ug) from the 11 options in the left-hand column and find a supplier of insulating glass units (IGUs) with this performance. The Ug of the glazing units must be calculated following the requirements of EN 673, including providing the emissivity from tests completed to EN 12898. The Window & Glass Association New Zealand provides a calculator for members to use to determine this number. This method is typically used where there is a single type of exterior joinery and a single type of glazing unit and allows selection of the generic Rwindow for the houselot of exterior joinery from the table.
If you want to use different IGUs than specified in Table E.1.1.1 or you have joinery that has had specific modelling of its thermal performance, you may want to use another approach.
Table E.1.1.1 replicator
This approach requires that the thermal performance of a specific joinery brand (Rwindow) has been modelled and the results have been verified. This information will typically be provided by a joinery supplier who does not want to rely on the default values from Table E.1.1.1. As for the use of Table E.1.1.1, this method provides the thermal performance for a typical houselot of a selected joinery brand with a particular Ug.
As this approach is an Alternative Solution, it may require verification by a building consent authority each time it is used unless it is provided by a trusted supplier or packaged within a third-party certification. This method can often provide evidence of better thermal performance than the default values of the typical houselots modelled for Table E.1.1.1.
Window Energy Efficiency Rating System (WEERS)
The WEERS process provides the actual thermal performance of the selected windows calculated using the certified process from an authorised WEERS provider. This is the most accurate method of calculating the thermal performance of the actual joinery that is being used on your project. While it is generally accepted by all BCAs since WEERS was developed in partnership with BRANZ, the Window & Glass Association New Zealand and government, technically it also remains an Alternative Solution.
Statement of thermal performance
The fourth common method for using the schedule method is a statement of thermal performance – certification provided by the window supplier taking responsibility that its windows meet the requirement of H1. This means the supplier is responsible for using one of the previous processes or another adequately verified process and by default takes the form of the document provided by the Window & Glass Association New Zealand (see Figure 2).

Design trends are seeing an increase in the use of internal gutters, previously seen as risky. They have been associated with weathertightness failure but, with advances in their design and construction, they are now a viable option. This article from BRANZ provides more details.
Internal gutters and weathertightness
We continue to see internal gutters in new housing, in part thanks to changing design trends and the availability of high-performance, durable membranes. The heavy rainfall Cyclone Tam in April 2025 and more recent winter storms has only reinforced BRANZ’s long-held view that internal gutters, where they are not designed out, require meticulous design and construction and regular cleaning to avoid the risks of overflow during intense rain. BRANZ recommends a conservative design approach.
Internal gutters or gutters within the roof area – sometimes referred to as box gutters – have historically been associated with weathertightness failure, resulting in significant damage to the building interior and the associated inconvenience and cost of repair for the owner. This has resulted in designers avoiding them in their designs.
Due to changing trends in residential design as well as the availability of high-performance, durable membranes, there has been a rise in the inclusion of internal membrane gutters in housing – often associated with low-pitch membrane roofs or other low-pitch roofing systems.
Factors for failure
Factors blamed for the failure of internal roof gutters include:
Inadequate design – insufficient capacity, lack of gutter fall, depth/freeboard and the number of drainage outlets and associated drainage overflows.
Poor construction and installation.
Incorrect material selection.
Blockages to the gutter and drainage systems that restrict drainage and create a build-up of water.
Lack of maintenance by building owners.
Because of the failure risk of internal gutters, they must be accurately designed and constructed, and building owners must be made aware of the requirement for them to be regularly checked and maintained.
Regardless of the specified roofing material and pitch, membrane internal gutters are a viable roof drainage option and are included in Building Code guidance documents. There is a wide range of suitable membranes available, with most manufacturers and suppliers providing design and installation guidance for both internal roof gutters and associated drainage systems.
Many of the current membranes are pliable and easier to accurately install in more-confined situations often associated with internal gutters. The use of designated membrane installers has also improved the quality of installation.
Refer to E2/AS1
E2/AS1 , the guidance document for compliance with Building Code clause E2 External moisture , has information on the requirements for internal gutters lined with butyl or EPDM membrane. The use of other membranes suitable for internal gutters is also possible, but these alternatives will require proof of compliance as an Alternative Solution.
E1/AS1 is the guidance document for compliance with clause E1 Surface water , covering requirements for membrane internal roof gutters and associated drainage.
Clause B2 Durability calls for the membrane to have a specified intended life of not less than 15 years. However, it is sensible to select a membrane that meets the serviceable life of the roof cladding, which could be expected to be greater than this. Selecting a more durable membrane is sensible given that replacement will be relatively difficult in most situations.
Butyl and EPDM membrane internal gutter requirements
While it is non-mandatory to follow Acceptable Solutions as a means of Building Code compliance, both E2/AS1 and E1/AS1 provide good guidance for the design and construction of membrane internal gutters.
E2/AS1 8.1.6.1 sets out specific requirements for membrane internal gutters. They must be constructed with solid substrate gutter boards that facilitate walking on for both construction, membrane installation and ongoing regular maintenance. Construction materials must be compatible with the specified membrane.
The membrane must be installed in one run along the length of the gutter, with no cross-joints in the installation. Butyl or EPDM membrane must be 1.5mm minimum thickness – 1.0mm thickness is acceptable for gutters less than 1m wide.
In no case should the gutter have dimensions of less than a depth of 60mm minimum and an overall width of 300mm minimum. A freeboard depth of 30mm minimum – over and above the required minimum gutter depth – is required in all situations, with a minimum fall of 1:100 to drainage outlets.
An exception to these requirements is where a membrane internal gutter is incorporated into a membrane roof. In these situations, the minimum gutter depth is 50mm and there is no requirement for a freeboard allowance.
Where the membrane gutter is installed in roofs formed with non-membrane claddings – for example, profiled metal – the gutter membrane must underflash the roofing material a minimum of 100mm.
E1/AS1 5.1 sets out specific requirements for the size of internal roof gutters. The internal gutter size needs to be based on dividing the gutter into sections – a section is comprised of the length of gutter between a downpipe or drainage outlet and the high point of the gutter draining to that downpipe/drainage outlet.
Each section of internal gutter needs to have a cross-sectional area not less than that shown in E1/AS1 Figure 16, which provides the area of gutter based on the plan area and pitch of the roof discharging into the section of gutter. The cross-sectional area required is based on a rainfall intensity (I) of 100mm/hr. Many areas of Aotearoa have a rainfall intensity greater than this – these are shown in E1/AS1 Table A.
Where the intensity for the gutter design under consideration is greater than 100mm/hr, the required gutter size needs to be calculated by taking the value from Table A and multiplying it by the ratio of I/100.
Internal gutters must drain to downpipes – often via a scupper into a rainwater head or an internal drainage outlet. E1/AS1 Table 5 provides the minimum internal size for round and rectangular downpipes for a given roof pitch and roof plan area served by the downpipe.
All membrane internal gutters require overflow outlets. E1/AS1 5.5.1 calls for overflow outlets that drain to the exterior of the building, with the top of the outlet set at least 50mm below the top of the gutter. The cross-sectional area of the overflow shall be the same size or greater than the size of the downpipes serving that section of internal gutter.
Drainage outlets and overflows for internal gutters in membrane roofs shall be formed as shown in E2/AS1 Figures 63 and 64.
Membrane internal gutter discharge options
Membrane internal gutters serving other roofs – for example, profiled metal – must discharge into a rainwater head (which incorporates an overflow) as shown in E2/AS1 Figure 63(a) and (b). Alternatively, they can discharge to an internal outlet as shown in E2/AS1 Figure 64(b) or (c), with overflows provided by another outlet to a rainwater head or an overflow as shown in Figure 63(c), positioned at a height that will not allow water to overflow into the building from the gutter.
Membrane internal gutters – design and construction
When an internal gutter incorporated into a long-run metal or tile roof fails or overflows, it is likely that water will enter the building’s roof assembly and ultimately the interior. While this is less likely with a membrane gutter that is integral with a roofing membrane, it is still a possibility. Therefore, accurate design and construction is fundamental for effective internal gutter performance.
Key considerations for membrane internal gutter design:
Design internal gutters that are sufficient to capture and dispose of the maximum rainfall intensity that the roof catchment will be exposed to, regarding width, depth and freeboard.
Eliminate any changes of direction where possible – run the gutter in one straight length.
Ensure the gutter has effective fall.
Have sufficient outlets – in the case of one outlet being blocked, another can discharge the full potential catchment.
Incorporate effective overflow outlets that are located so that overflow water is visible to building occupants.
Specify a gutter membrane that is fit for purpose.
Size the gutter to allow easy access for maintenance.
Ensure the gutter is constructed to eliminate potential in-service deflection or structural movement.
What to consider
To ensure internal membrane gutters collect and drain water as effectively as possible, it is better to be more conservative with design and construction:
Design to a rainfall intensity of not less than 200mm/hr.
Ensure the gutter has sufficient freeboard capacity to prevent overflowing due to wave action occurring in windy situations.
Take the sides of the gutter well above the height of the drainage outlet or overflow.
Construct the gutter wider than the 300mm minimum required.
Increase the number of drainage outlets beyond requirements.
Incorporate snow guards in snow-prone locations.
Ensure downpipes and/or spreaders from above do not discharge directly into an internal gutter.
Incorporate drainage outlets at no more than 12m centres.
Incorporate dome-type leaf guards to internal drainage outlets.
Increase the gutter fall beyond the required 1:100 minimum – a 1:60 fall will provide better drainage.
Locate overflow outlets where overflow will be easily visible.
Ensure the gutter construction is solid enough to eliminate deflection or sagging over the life of the building.
Maintenance is crucial
Once the internal membrane gutter installation is complete, it should be flood tested to ensure that it drains effectively and that there are no leaks. Any internal downpipes associated with the gutter must also be pressure tested prior to enclosure.
As internal gutters have a higher risk of failure because of lack of maintenance, building owners need to be made aware of the need for regular inspections of both the gutter and drainage systems and the removal of any accumulated debris. Inspection for any potential degradation of the membrane is also important.

High levels of indoor moisture are one of the major contributors to unhealthy homes. Indicators include condensation on windows and hard surfaces such as mirrors and tiles, mould and mildew growth on ceilings, walls and curtains, and a musty, stale smell
It can be both harmful to health and damaging to interior spaces and can be challenging to manage effectively – indoor moisture is produced constantly and from many sources.
Sources of indoor moisture
The main sources of internal moisture in New Zealand homes come from occupants’ daily activities such as:
Cooking.
Washing.
Showering or bathing.
Drying clothes indoors.
Unflued gas heating.
Respiration.
Other sources can include construction moisture, leaks from internal or external sources and subfloor moisture infiltration. This article deals with indoor moisture control arising from occupants’ activities.
Activities such as cooking, washing and showering or bathing cannot be eliminated but can be managed by good ventilation at source.
Moisture generated from unflued gas heaters and drying clothes indoors can and should be completely eliminated. An unflued gas heater can be replaced with another heating source such as electric or flued gas heating, and clothes should not be dried indoors except in a space with good cross-flow ventilation.
Ventilation
Good ventilation – the process of supplying and removing air to control air quality – is the key to effective management of internal moisture. It is most effective when moisture is removed at its source.
Ventilation can be:
Passive (natural) ventilation.
Mechanical ventilation.
Passive ventilation
Passive ventilation occurs when windows are opened.
New Zealand Building Code clause G4 Ventilation requires that all occupied spaces are ventilated. Acceptable Solution G4/AS1 1.2 states that natural ventilation must be achieved by providing an area of opening windows or other openings to the exterior that is at least 5% of the floor area of the space. This requirement cannot control the amount of moisture removed.
Cross-flow ventilation and stack ventilation
The effectiveness of passive ventilation can be increased by cross-flow ventilation or stack ventilation.
Cross-flow ventilation is achieved by opening windows on more than one external wall of the room, allowing a cross-flow of air (Figure 1). It occurs because of differential air pressures on either side of a building that pull air through the interior space.
Stack ventilation occurs where there are low-level and high-level windows that provide an open path through which air can flow such as opening clerestory windows or in two-storey construction (Figure 2). It is caused because of warm indoor air rising and exiting through openings higher up in the building – resulting in air being drawn up through the space.
Trickle ventilation
Trickle ventilation provides continuous passive ventilation while maintaining security with two-setting window fasteners or grilles or mesh-covered openings in window sashes. Both allow a continuous flow of fresh air into the room. The two-setting window fasteners allow the window to be opened a very small degree and still maintain security, while grilles or openings in the window sashes means there is some ventilation when the window is closed.
The openings can generally be closed off by a sliding cover, and some trickle ventilators have automated opening and closing. Trickle ventilation is available as an optional extra in new aluminium joinery and can be installed into existing aluminium and timber windows.
Infiltration
Infiltration – uncontrolled air movement through gaps and openings in the building envelope – typically occurs because of differential air pressure between the interior and the exterior.
It occurs readily in older homes that are more draughty, but infiltration cannot be regarded as a means of providing ventilation in new homes, which have become increasingly airtight with the aim to reduce infiltration to an acceptable level. Therefore, alternative means to introduce fresh air into new buildings must be employed.
Mechanical ventilation
Under clause G4, buildings must have a means of collecting and removing cooking fumes and odours and moisture from washing and bathing. G4/AS1 1.2.5 states that household and accommodation units with mechanical extract fans (for intermittent operation) are to have flow rates of at least 25 L/sec for showers and baths and 50 L/sec for cooktops.
Mechanical extractor fans in kitchens typically consist of a rangehood over the stove or cooktop or a downdraft extractor system adjacent to the cooktop. Some cooktops also include an integrated downdraft ventilation system. Rangehoods and downdraft extractor systems discharge to the exterior through ducting.
Extractor fans in bathrooms may be either wall or window-installed fans that discharge directly to the exterior, or ceiling-mounted extractor fans that are typically ducted through the roof space to discharge through the roof, a soffit or an external wall.
Ducted mechanical ventilation systems must discharge to the exterior of the building, not into a ceiling or subfloor space. Ducting from separate extract fans must not be combined or shared. If they are, ductwork dampers must be installed.
Whole-house ventilation systems
Fresh air can be brought into new, airtight homes with the installation of a whole-house ventilation system. These systems basically consist of:
Fans to move air in and out.
Ducting.
Intake grilles and outlet diffusers
Two generic systems available are:
Balanced (heat recovery) systems.
Supply (positive pressure) systems.
Balanced systems
A balanced heat recovery system is a ducted system consisting of two fans – one to draw air in from outside and one to remove stale internal air to the outside. An air-to-air heat exchanger, generally installed in a roof space, recovers heat from the outgoing air before it is discharged to the exterior (Figures 3 and 4).
The recovered heat is transferred to the incoming air before it is pumped into the indoor spaces. By recovering some of the heat from the outgoing air, less heating is required to maintain a comfortable indoor air temperature.
Supply systems
A supply or positive pressure system brings air inside to create a slight positive pressure inside that forces stale, indoor air out through gaps and air leakage paths (Figure 5). For this system to be effective, the supply airflow rate must be higher than the leakage airflow rate.
While supply ventilation systems are generally designed to run continuously, some systems will vary the air-change rate depending on the temperature difference between outside and inside.
This can potentially mean insufficient fresh air being brought inside during colder weather and result in inadequate ventilation and high moisture loads.
Solar ventilation air preheating systems
Solar ventilation air preheating systems use solar energy to preheat fresh supply air that is drawn through solar panels before being pumped to the interior. As they use the sun’s heat to warm the air, they can be efficient to run, and the solar cells can also be used to power the fans. However, these systems can be expensive to install and only operate efficiently when the sun is shining.
Improving ventilation during renovations
Improving ventilation must be considered when planning renovation work.
A whole-house ventilation system may be too difficult or costly to install into an existing house, but kitchen and bathroom renovations should include installing mechanical ventilation systems.
Other means of improving ventilation such as installing additional windows to provide more window opening area or to facilitate cross-flow ventilation should also be considered.

Driveways, paths and patios are among the key finishing touches that complete a home. This fifth article in CCANZ’s series on residential concrete focuses on placement.
The basic function of residential pavements, such as driveways, paths and patios, is to provide safe and easy access onto or around a property.
Concrete is typically used to not only provide a durable paving surface (sloped, to provide surface water run-off) but one which can also incorporate a wide range of decorative finishes to complement the design and landscaping of the residence.
While creating a concrete pavement is relatively straightforward, there are a number of design and construction aspects that need to be considered, in order to produce a finished product that satisfies the functional and aesthetic requirements of the homeowners.
Many types of joint sealants are available. For pavements, high-performance sealants such as polyurethane or silicone should be used. They are supplied in cartridges for easy use with a caulking gun, come in a range of colours to suit various decorative finishes and are UV-resistant. While the life of the sealant depends on a number of factors, the following basic rules concerning their use should be observed to achieve adequate performance:
” For pavements, high-performance sealants such as polyuethanse or silicone should be used
Joint preparation. The surfaces should be clean, dry and primed if necessary. Applying sealants to ‘green’ concrete can result in bubbling and loss of adhesion. The surface temperature should be above 5°C.
Joint geometry. For typical joints, the cross-sectional depth of the seal should be at least half the width, and never greater than the width.
Backing systems. To perform adequately when the pavement moves, sealants should adhere only to the sides of the joint. While the joint filler will normally ensure this, a backing rod may sometimes be necessary to achieve the required joint geometry.
Setting time. The setting time of the sealant determines when it can be brought into service, or when the pavement can be used. Polyurethane sealants will cure at a rate of about 2-3 mm of depth per day in temperatures over 5°C. Fast-curing and two-part products will be marginally faster. Silicones skin quickly but have a slower cure-through-depth time.
” Penetrating sealers, or those with slip-resistant properties, are recommended for steeper grades
Sealers are used to prevent staining and to facilitate cleaning of the concrete surface. They should be applied after the curing period and when the concrete has dried out sufficiently to allow the sealer to penetrate into the concrete surface.
Note that some sealers may also function as a chemical curing compound and should be applied after finishing. Some sealers may also be tinted and thus provide both a seal and a coloured finish.
As the penetration of sealers into the concrete surface varies, their suitability for a particular application should be discussed with the manufacturer.
Steep driveways warrant special consideration; non-penetrating sealers that form a film on the surface can reduce slip and skid resistance. This means they are generally not suitable for this application, unless the surface texture applied to the concrete is coarse enough to provide adequate slip and skid resistance.

Horizontal timber weatherboards have been a popular cladding material for houses in Aotearoa New Zealand for many years, with an excellent track record for durability when properly installed and maintained. Even when maintenance has been less than ideal, timber weatherboards have sometimes lasted more than 100 years
Apart from their durability and as seen by their long-term use in our housing, timber weatherboards have a range of other benefits, including availability of a wide range of timber and profiles, ease of installation and the ability to cope with seismic, thermal and moisture movement. They also have good impact resistance, good drying in both direct-fixed and cavity installations and a proven performance history.
However, they are slower to install than some other claddings, and as timber is hygroscopic, that is, absorbs moisture from the atmosphere, the boards move with changes in moisture content. Due to the large number of horizontal joints, there is an increased risk of water entry, and paint and stain finishes require regular recoating.
Weatherboard profiles
Horizontal timber weatherboards are typically either a bevel-back or rusticated profile (see Figure 1). Standard profiles are described in NZS 3617:1979 Specification for profiles of weatherboards, fascia boards, and flooring and BRANZ Bulletin 411 Recommended timber cladding profiles.
Weatherboards on older houses, however, are likely to vary in both profile and dimension, and sizes are generally imperial rather than metric.
Durability requirements
Maintenance is an ongoing requirement with timber weatherboards. Under New Zealand Building Code clause B2 Durability, exterior wall claddings must have a minimum durability of 15 years.
Table 2 in NZS 3602:2003 Timber and wood-based products for use in building identifies timbers – and treatments where required – that meet the minimum 15-year durability requirement. For example, Pinus radiata must be treated to at least hazard class H3.1 and it must be painted. If treated to hazard class H3.2, it may be used without a paint coating. Western red cedar, redwood and heart cypress do not require preservative treatment and may be uncoated or stain- finished, while larch, which does not require treatment, must be painted.
Fixing weatherboards
All horizontal timber weatherboards are lapped and fixed using one nail fixing per stud along the length of the boards. The fixings allow movement as a result of moisture and reduce the likelihood of the boards splitting, bowing or cupping. energy dissipation, ductility, strength and stiffness for prescriptive and specific engineered wall bracing designs. Damage during cyclic loading was less for the SIPs than most of the more commonly used bracing systems.
Bevel-back weatherboards have a thicker bottom edge, which reduces the risk of cupping, while gaps behind the boards limit the board contact with the framing and improving drying behind the cladding.
Rusticated weatherboard have a rebate along their bottom edge that forms the lap over the board below.
The reduced thickness of the rebate makes the boards more prone to deformation and splitting, and a minimum 2mm expansion gap in the rebate must be provided to prevent the timber from buckling (see Figure 1).
As rusticated weatherboards have a flat, rear face with a greater board to framing contact, the drying that can occur behind the boards is more limited.
Timber fixings must have the same durability as the cladding, which is not less than 15 years. Protection of fixings to meet durability requirements is based on the exposure zone of the building as defined in section 4 of NZS 3604: 2011 Timber-framed buildings.
Common problems
While timber weatherboards have shown excellent durability over many years, deterioration of the timber will occur if not maintained. Weatherboard failure can compromise weathertightness and cause serious damage to the structure and other parts of the building. Any failure should be repaired or replaced as soon as possible.
The most common cause of timber deterioration is failure of the protective paint coating, allowing timber to get and remain wet, which ultimately causes rotting. Paint failure may occur because of paintwork exceeding its serviceable life, poor preparation prior to painting, an incorrect paint system being used for the situation or timber or fixings that have corroded. Other reasons for timber failure include:
Split or cracked boards due to incorrect fixing such as double nailing (which restricts timber movement), fixing through laps or fixing too close to cut ends.
Bowing or cupping because of incorrect moisture content at the time of installation, insufficient gaps to allow movement between boards or a failure to prime the back face of the weatherboards.
Nails popping, which occurs if the moisture content of the framing is too high when weatherboards are fixed or there has been inadequate nail punching and/or stopping.
Failure at joints or gaps in running joints or mitred external corners, all of which admit water into the timber.
Damaged plugs, scribers, facings or boxed corners.
Corroded metal fixings, flashings and soakers will also cause timber deterioration. Corrosion occurs because of poor maintenance, damage to protective coatings, or incorrect metal selection for location or timber compatibility.
Exposure to marine conditions and airborne pollutants or attack from cedar, redwood or copper-based treated timbers are all corrosive to zinc coated steel.
There are also problems with timber weatherboards that, while not impacting on the weathertightness of the cladding, do affect the appearance.
These include:
Differential weathering between exposed and sheltered areas of cladding – particularly where timber is uncoated.
Resin bleed through the paint.
Fine cracking of the paint ﬁnish, typically at board laps, due to timber movement.
Timber movement opening up lap end joints.
Fading and chalking of the paint finish, especially when dark colours are used.
Maintenance of timber weatherboards
Timber cladding should be washed down with water – or a chemical wash, if necessary – every six months in a coastal environment and annually when further away from the coast to prevent a build-up of dirt, dust, mould and mildew.
Avoid using high-pressure water such as a waterblaster, which can erode the paint surface and drive water between laps and behind facings. Regular washing also helps early identification of signs of cladding deterioration.
1. Repainting The most effective way to maintain weatherboards in good condition is to repaint regularly.
If the paintwork is undamaged, the weatherboards can simply be washed and repainted. Wash paintwork with water to remove dirt and mildew.
If the paintwork is flaking or peeling but the timber is sound, the flaking or peeling paint should be removed by scraping and sanding. Wash the paintwork and prime all exposed timber before repainting. Where the paintwork is in poor condition, the best solution may be to completely strip the paint back to bare timber using either a chemical paint stripper or a hot air gun before priming and repainting.
2. Removing lead based paint Before 1970, most houses were painted with lead-based paint. Care must be taken when removing this to avoid toxic fumes and soil contamination. It is not possible to identify lead-based paint by appearance, but it can be tested by using a lead-based paint test kit. When removing lead-based paint from the exterior, ensure all windows and doors are closed and collect paint debris on a groundsheet.
Seal the paint debris in heavy-duty plastic bags and dispose of it in accordance with local council requirements.
3. Rot or decay Rot or decay in timber is generally visible but can also be easily confirmed by prodding the timber with a screwdriver. If the screwdriver goes into the timber easily, the timber is rotten.
The rotted section of timber should be removed to at least 1m beyond the extent of the rot and the cut sections on both sides of the cut area sealed and primed (see Figure 2). The framing timber should be checked to ensure that the rot has not spread. If it has, extensive repair work is required.
3. Cracking and splitting If there is no water entry, the timber is sound and the crack or split is not more than 2 mm wide and 400mm long, it can be filled with putty or exterior-grade flexible filler, then sanded and painted over. If the crack or split allows water entry into the wall cavity, the board should be replaced.
4. Bowing and cupping If the bowing or cupping is minor and no water is getting behind the cladding, the boards may be left. Ensure that all nails are fully punched and stopped. If the boards had been finished with a clear coating or stain, new coatings should be applied. If the timber had been uncoated, the application of a clear finish, paint or stain to reduce moisture absorption is recommended.
If bowing or cupping is pronounced and water is getting in, the boards should be replaced. Do not attempt to remedy the problem by double nailing as this will almost certainly cause the boards to crack in the future.
6. Popped or corroded nails If nails are proud of the weatherboards, punch them in or, if possible, remove them and replace with larger, stainless steel, annular grooved or galvanised nails or with countersunk screws. Screws are more likely to reduce the likelihood of nails re-popping as they have better holding power than nails.
For minor corrosion of nails in painted weatherboards, sand the affected areas to remove rust or oxide staining, then apply a galvanised primer followed by two coats of paint.
Alternatively, punch nails at least 5 mm into the timber cladding and apply a rust killer to the punch holes, followed by paint primer. When dry, stop the holes with putty or exterior-grade filler, sand and repaint with at least two coats of paint.
For unpainted weatherboards, remove old nails if possible and replace with stainless steel or silicone bronze nails.
Punch nails in if they cannot be removed. The timber may be sanded to remove staining but it is likely to reoccur, and until the timber weathers, the sanded area is likely to be more obvious than the stain.
7. Corroded metal fixings , flashings and soakers Where there is minor surface corrosion of steel components, sand the affected areas to remove rust or oxide staining, then apply a galvanised primer followed by two coats of paint. If corrosion has weakened flashings or soakers, remove and replace them in accordance with E2/AS1.
8. Gaps in running joints or mitred external corners Where gaps are no more than 3-4mm, the joints should be cleaned out and loose paint removed.
Apply primer to the gaps, then fill joints with exterior-grade flexible filler before sanding and painting.
9. Missing or damaged plugs and scribers Damaged or missing plugs can be replaced and sealed using an exterior-grade paintable sealant. Once the sealant is dry, the area can be primed and painted.
If scribers are in good condition with no rot, they can be removed, cleaned and primed, then replaced and sealed using a sealant applied to the board edges and the profiled scriber edges. Once the sealant is dry, the area can be primed and painted.

While the use of timber weatherboard cladding varies with changing trends, it remains perennially popular and its design and installation is well documented
Timber horizontal weatherboards, originally native timbers, have been in common use since the early 1800s. Currently, timber weatherboards have around a 25% market share for residential wall claddings.
Timber has lots of appeal because it is:
Readily available (although the type of species has changed).
A natural renewable resource when sustainably sourced, for example, radiata pine.
Biodegradable.
Hygroscopic – it will take up and release moisture.
Readily treatable for species used for weatherboards.
Naturally variable.
Machinable.
Easily finished.
Relevant code clauses and standards
Building Code clauses applicable to timber weatherboards are:
B1 Structure – to resist deflection and wind-induced suction.
B2 Durability – a durability of not less than 15 years for weatherboards, as they are moderately difficult to detect and replace.
E2 External moisture – to ensure buildings shall be constructed to provide adequate resistance to penetration by, and the accumulation of, moisture from the outside.
Cited standards and documents are:
NZS 3602:2003 Timber and woodbased products for use in building.
NZS 3604:2011 Timber-framed buildings.
NZS 3617:1979 Specification for profiles of weatherboards, fascia boards, and flooring.
NZS 3631:1988 New Zealand timber grading rules.
NZS 3640:2003 Chemical preservation of round and sawn timber (including Amendment 5).
BRANZ Bulletin 411: Recommended timber cladding profiles.
Selecting the timber and profile
Most timber weatherboard used in New Zealand is machined from either imported western red cedar or fingerjointed treated pine. There is limited use of:
Clear or dressing grade (tight knot) treated radiata pine.
Imported redwood.
Heart macrocarpa.
Radiata pine requires treatment for durability, while other more durable species such as imported redwood, imported western red cedar and heart macrocarpa can be left untreated.
Bevel-back profile weatherboards tend to be less vulnerable to water penetration than rusticated boards, as they are thicker at the lap and therefore distort less. They also offer a void at the back face of the lap that facilitates some air circulation for drying and some drainage.
Because timber weatherboards are subject to movement, they may allow occasional water penetration through the board laps. However, this distortion also allows some air circulation and drainage, and this tends to dry or remove water that has penetrated the assembly.
Getting the design right
Key elements of horizontal timber weatherboard design include:
Identifying the species and treatment profiles in accordance with NZS 3617:1979 or BRANZ Bulletin 411 to meet the requirements of E2/AS1 – other profiles must be submitted for consent as an alternative method.
Under E2/AS1 , a drainage cavity is required where the risk score exceeds 12 for bevel-back and six for rusticated.
Set out the window head heights to suit the weatherboard dimensions.
A 175mm minimum clearance to finished ground or 100mm to permanent paving.
Specifying narrower rather than wider boards.
Specifying single nailing to each board.
Specifying the finish.
Naturally durable weatherboards such as cedar should be clear-coated or stained; H3.2 treated timber can be stained or painted, while H3.1 treated radiata pine must be painted on all surfaces including all ends, notches and holes.
Store level and covered
Store boards on a level surface packed clear of the ground. Reject any damaged boards. Cover to keep as dry as possible. Recover at the end of each day’s work or when rain threatens.
Get the installation correct
Follow these rules when installing on site:
Have a minimum lap of 32mm for bevel-back boards – 25mm for rusticated profile boards.
Do not nail through the board lap.
Do not apply sealant to laps.
For rusticated boards, ensure boards are not tightly butted at the overlap, as this will restrict movement – a 2mm gap is required.
Seal all cuts immediately.
Seal all cut ends and notches where boards have an applied finish.
Install soakers, cover boards or backflashings to all corner junctions.
Paint H3.1 treated boards.
Avoid dark finishes, as this will increase distortion in timber weatherboards. Choose paint colours with an LRV of 40% or more.
Maintain specified ground clearances at completion of all work including landscaping.

Head flashings over windows have the vital job of directing water back to the outside. Unfortunately, poor installation is common – here’s what you need to know
As part of a BRANZ research project, inspectors visited more than 200 houses under construction. They found a number of issues with head flashings, including:
No stop-ends or upturns.
Upturns too small.
Flashings too short to cover the window frame at the ends.
Inadequate slopes to flashing surfaces.
Inadequate gap between flashing and cladding.
Flashing in two pieces with a poor, or no, junction seal.
This is what should happen
A metal head flashing with a minimum 15° slope is installed against the wall underlay and over the window frame to provide 10mm cover to the face of the window frame (Figure 1).
Figure 1
The flashing should be in a single piece that fully reaches both ends of the frame. Stop-ends must be formed at each end to prevent water running behind the cladding.
A 5mm minimum drainage and ventilation gap must be left between the top of the sloped flashing and the bottom of the cladding above it. This opening lets water drain from the assembly and allows air to enter to provide drying.
The head flashing upstand must be sealed to the face of the wall underlay with flexible flashing tape, or an extra layer of wall underlay must be dropped from above to create a gravity drainage path out over the flashing.
The total upstand must be 40mm minimum. The lap under the cladding must be a minimum 35mm (60mm in the extra-high wind zone).
The key requirements for head flashings are given in Acceptable Solution E2/AS1 . This document also has other requirements in addition to those above:
With direct-fixed claddings, there must be a 50mm sealant bead between the cladding and each end of the flashing.
In cavity construction, there must be:
–– 10mm turn-ups acting as stop-ends, finishing at the inside face of the cladding and not passing through it.
–– ventilation of the cavity with use of a cavity base closure.
In very-high and extra-high wind zones, there must be sealant between the underside of the head flashing and the top of the window head flange.
Sloped heads must have specifically designed kickout flashings at the bottom edges of head flashings.
BRANZ research ( Study Report 313 ) found that head flashings were more leak resistant when the upstand fitted tightly against the cavity closure. It also found that window head flashings handle run-off better where there is a greater clearance between cladding and flashing.

Past media reports have drawn attention to damage from leaking showers. Although tiles may be impervious to water, cement-based grout is not, so the waterproofing in tiled showers is crucial
A leak in a tiled shower can be difficult to discover and may result in severe damage and costly repairs. The key to a tiled shower that won’t leak is in the substrate and waterproofing installation.
Performance requirements
New Zealand Building Code clause E3 Internal Moisture requires that surfaces likely to be splashed must be impervious to water, easily cleaned and prevent water from penetrating behind linings or into concealed spaces.
Acceptable Solution E3/AS1 provides a range of options for linings and finishes in showers that meet the performance requirements of clause E3. These include that ceramic or stone tiles have 6% maximum water absorption, have waterproof grouted joints and are bedded with an adhesive suitable for the tiles, substrate and wet area environment.
It also states that ceramic or stone tiles must be laid over a continuous impervious substrate or membrane (see Figure 1).
Information on installing tiled showers can be found in BRANZ’s Good Practice Guide Tiling: 3rd edition . AS 3740-2010 Waterproofing of domestic wet areas also provides useful advice.
Waterproofing requirements
For enclosed showers, impervious linings and finishes such as walls must:
Be continuous.
Be at least 1,800mm high from the floor or top of an upstand.
Extend at least 300mm above the shower head.
When the shower is not enclosed, impervious linings and finishes must extend in a horizontal radius of 1,500mm from the showerhead (see Figure 2).
An enclosed shower with upstands must have a minimum 1:60 fall towards the floor waste. For a shower with a level access, the fall must be at least 1:50 towards the floor waste.
This must extend over a radius of 1,500mm from a point measured vertically below the showerhead or from any wall within the radius (see Figure 3).
For a bathroom or other wet area room with a tiled floor, laying a waterproof membrane across the entire floor and extending it up all walls for at least 150mm is recommended.
A waterstop (see Figure 4) should be provided where the membrane terminates at adjacent spaces such as doorways.
If the substrate is a sand or cement mortar or screed, the waterproof membrane should be laid over this. Cable entry points for under tile floor heating laid under the waterproof membrane must be above the flood level of the wet area.
This article will be continued in the next issue of Under Construction .

The design, material selection and construction of wet area floors is critical to the performance of a building.
If the water in these areas is not contained, significant damage can occur to timber framing and wood or wood-based flooring. When selecting wood-based flooring for wet areas, the key requirement is durability.
Building Code clause E3: Internal moisture performance requirements states that:
Freewater from accidental overflow from sanitary fixtures or sanitary appliances must be disposed of in a way that avoids loss of amenity or damage to household units or other property (E3.3.2).
Floor surfaces of any space containing sanitary fixtures or sanitary appliances must be impervious and easily cleaned (E3.3.3).
Surfaces of building elements likely to be splashed or become contaminated in the course of the intended use of the building must be impervious and easily cleaned (E3.3.5).
Surfaces of building elements likely to be splashed must be constructed in a way that prevents water splash from penetrating behind linings or into concealed spaces (E3.3.6).
Suitable impervious finishes listed in E3/AS1 that meet the above requirements for floors in splash zones are:
Integrally waterproof sheet material (eg polyvinylchloride), with sealed joints.
Ceramic or stone tiles with 6% maximum water absorption and waterproof grouted joints, bedded with an adhesive specified by the tile manufacturer as being suitable for the tiles, substrate material and environment of use.
“When selecting wood-based flooring for wet areas, the key requirement is durability
Cement-based solid plaster or concrete, with a steel trowel or polished finish (semi-gloss or gloss paint must be used if a paint finish is required).
Cork tile or sheet sealed with waterproof coatings and sealed joints.
Monolithic coatings, with a polished non-absorbent finish (eg terrazzo).
A timber or timber-based product, such as particleboard sealed with waterproof coatings
Shower areas present a higher risk, so the requirements in E3/AS1 are different:
Ceramic or stone tile finishes must be laid on a continuous impervious substrate or membrane.
The use of cork tile or sheet sealed with waterproof and applied coatings, and sheet linings finished with vinyl-coated wallpaper or semi-gloss or gloss coating, are excluded.
NZS 3604 Section 4: Durability has, in clause 4.3.4, the requirement that wood-based building components in wet areas such as bathrooms, kitchens, laundries and toilets be protected by an impervious finish or a lining with sealed joints.
Amendment 7 to NZBC Acceptable Solution B2/AS1 modifies sections 109 and 110 of NZS 3602, where maintenance of an impervious finish cannot be assured for plywood and timber flooring.
While there are various documents that provide guidance on the type of treatment required when forming a suspended framed floor platform in wet areas, none provide concise advice for all options.
Wood-based wet flooring options are:
BRANZ-appraised H3.1-treated reconstituted woodboard.
B2/AS1 amendment to NZS 3602, which requires H3-treated plywood or H1.2-treated solid radiata pine or Douglas fir.
Other timber species such as matai or rimu in accordance with Table 1 (1C3) of NZS 3602.

Calls to BRANZ helplines have revealed confusion created by differing advice in NZS 3604:2011 on the ground clearance needed for particleboard flooring. So, what is the ground clearance  needed?
When the flooring of a suspended timber-framed floor is particleboard, NZS 3604:2011 Timber-framed buildings specifies a minimum clearance of 550mm between the underside of the  particleboard and the ground (paragraph 2.3.7).
However, paragraph 6.4.1.1 in NZS 3604:2011 allows a minimum pile height above finished ground level  of 150mm. So, in what situations may minimum pile heights apply?
Particleboard needs larger clearance
From Tables 6.4 and 7.1 in NZS 3604:2011 , the minimum permitted sizes of bearers and joists are 90 × 70 mm and 90 × 45mm respectively. If these sizes are used with piles 150mm high, the underside of the flooring will be 330mm above ground level (Figure 1).
Figure 1: Minimum permitted ground clearance under timber and plywood flooring
Timber strip and H3 CC-treated plywood flooring
Timber strip and H3 CCA-treated plywood flooring do not have restrictions on the permitted installation height above ground, so these flooring materials may be installed over subfloor framing with ground clearance of less than 550mm.
Particleboard flooring
If the same sized bearers and joists are used with particleboard flooring, the pile heights above finished ground level must be at least 370mm. Generally, larger joists are likely to be used, but regardless of the sizes of the subfloor framing, the clearance between the ground and the underside of the particleboard flooring must be at least 550mm (Figure 2).
Figure 2: Minimum permitted ground clearance under particleboard flooring
Note: These minimum subfloor clearances may not be achievable over the entire footprint of the building. NZS 3604:2011 requires crawl spaces to permit visual inspection of all subfloor framing. Clause 6.14.4 requires an access height of not less than 450mm to the underside of the floor joists, but does not require all timbers to be 450mm or more above the ground.
Add more protection, use polythene sheet
Particleboard flooring must be protected from exterior exposure. Where damp soil conditions exist, it is recommended that the ground be covered with polythene sheet. This includes where the minimum subfloor ventilation requirements of NZS 3604:2011 paragraph 6.14.1 are being met – a minimum net open area of 3,500mm² per m2 floor area.
A polythene ground cover should also be used in any situation where:
The subfloor ground is permanently or seasonally damp.
The airflow is obstructed by party walls, internal foundations or attached terraces.
The ground is more than 7.5m from a ventilation opening.

Stricter enforcement of work at height guidelines are now in place. As work ramps up, it’s time to get to grips with scaffolding best practice
Any work at height carries a risk of falling. When construction work cannot be carried out on the ground or a finished floor level, regulation 22 of the Health and Safety in Employment Regulations requires that a scaffold must be provided where work can’t be safely done without it.
Scaffolding is any temporary structure erected to:
Support people undertaking construction or construction-related work.
Provide a safe, stable platform to work on.
Hold the materials needed for the work being done.
A variety of scaffold systems are available, including:
‘Independent’ – such as tower, mobile, hung and birdcage scaffolds.
Single-pole scaffolds.
Suspended scaffolds.
Bracket scaffolds.
Trestle scaffolds.
Spur scaffolds.
Cantilevered scaffolds.
With the exception of suspended systems, a scaffold is a framework constructed from steel, fibreglass or aluminium tubes and connected by couplers – also called fittings – to support a work platform (see Figure 1).
Scaffolds may also be constructed from timber (up to 5m high), and a range of proprietary systems are available. The vertical tubes, called standards, are connected by couplers to longitudinal horizontal tubes (ledgers) and transverse horizontal tubes (transoms).
The work platforms may be either timber or steel, in accordance with AS/NZS 1577:2013 Scaffold decking components , and are supported on transoms and putlogs (additional transverse tubes). Timber planks may be solid timber, vertically laminated timber or laminated veneer lumber (LVL).
The open sides and ends of work platforms, landings and temporary stairways must protect workers against falling, by having guard rails with mid-rails and toe boards or infill panels (see Figure 2).
Top guard rails must be at least 900mm above the work platform. Where mid-rails are used, they must be located so that the gaps between guard rail and mid-rail, and between mid-rail and platform, are no more than 500mm.
Toe boards are installed at the platform level, so that tools or materials cannot fall off and be a hazard to anyone below. Toe boards must be continuous and a minimum of 150mm high. If infill panels are used, they must have either a kick plate or a separate toe board.
Where there is a small gap (typically 225mm, but no more than 300mm) between the scaffold and an adjacent structure, the inside edge protection may be omitted (see AS/NZS 1576.1:2010 Scaffolding – Part 1: General requirements clause 3.10.4.1).
The access for scaffolds is generally a stairway, but ramps and ladders may also be used in some situations ( AS/NZS 1576.1:2010 clause 3.11).
Stairs may be constructed using stair brackets with planks and tubes. Alternatively, proprietary stairway units are also available.
If possible, stairs should be located in a separate bay adjacent to the working platform. Regardless of location, the access opening should be protected by a gate or be far enough away from the working platform that someone cannot accidentally fall.
Base plates and sole boards – also referred to as base boards or sole plates – distribute the load from the scaffold standards to the ground or the supporting surface (see Figure 3).
Sole boards are typically timber and support steel base plates connected to each standard. They must be installed level and even, so the scaffold remains stable.
Scaffold systems need to be secured by being braced or tied to a support structure or by using stabilisers. They must be braced in at least two directions: that is, longitudinal (or face) braced, traverse braced or plan braced.
When the scaffold height is more than three times the width of the base, the scaffold must be tied to a supporting structure. Alternatively, stabilisers or outriggers can be used to increase the base width.
Tube and coupler scaffolds can be adapted to almost any configuration or loading application.
They must be able to carry all imposed dead and live loads for the duration of the use of the scaffold. The dead load is the self-weight of the scaffold. Live loads include:
Duty loads – the people and materials on the scaffold.
Environmental loads such as wind, snow and earthquake loads.
Impact loads that generally occur suddenly, such as when materials are placed on or taken off the scaffold.
Scaffold design must be in accordance with AS/NZS 1576: Parts 1–6 Scaffolding and AS/NZS 4576:1995 Guidelines for scaffolding .
AS/NZS 1576.1 defines four duty load categories – light, medium, heavy and special duty. These are based on uniformly distributed loads (UDLs) across each bay, but also factor in a design point load located in the most adverse position in the bay. Maximum duty loads are summarised in Table 1.
The Health and Safety in Employment Act 1992 requires risks from hazards in the workplace to be managed in a hierarchy of elimination, isolation and minimisation. Minimisation should only be considered when elimination and isolation are not possible.
The greatest risk from scaffolds is falling. As elimination and isolation are generally not risk management options, the risk must be minimised.
There are two main methods to minimise risk when erecting, dismantling and using scaffold:
Employing the tunnelling method of erecting and dismantling scaffold.
Wearing a hard hat, safety footwear, safety harness and personal fall arrest system, and being hooked on when working in any situation where a fall can occur.
“If any part of a scaffold system is 5 m or more above the ground, it may only be erected, altered, repaired and dismantled by a person with a certificate of competence that is the appropriate class for that particular type of scaffold
The tunnelling method of erecting and dismantling scaffold is when a guard rail is progressively installed from the level below. When the scaffolder climbs onto the platform, the edge protection is already in place to create a safe zone, and the possibility of a fall is minimised.
To be defined as a safe zone, there must be both:
A fully boarded and correctly supported platform without gaps.
A single guard rail between 900–1100mm above the platform.
Only competent people can erect, alter, repair and dismantle scaffold.
If any part of a scaffold system is 5m or more above the ground, it may only be erected, altered, repaired and dismantled by a person with a certificate of competence that is the appropriate class for that particular type of scaffold.
Scaffolding and Rigging New Zealand (SARNZ) issue certificates of competence under the authority of WorkSafe New Zealand.
When a person can fall 5m or more, scaffold work (including erection, alteration, repair and dismantling) is notifiable work under the Health and Safety in Employment Regulations (Section 2: Interpretation). The work must be notified in writing to WorkSafe New Zealand at least 24 hours before it begins.

TITLE   : Give me strength!… and cover, and quality

Not all concrete is the same. By considering four key factors, you can specify and create quality reinforced concrete that will pass the test of time.
Correctly specifying reinforced concrete exposed to the weather depends on:
The exposure zone of the location.
The strength of the concrete.
The amount of concrete cover provided to the reinforcing.
The quality of the concrete.
The placement and vibrating of the concrete.
Exposure zones need to be considered when specifying concrete exposed to wind, rain and salt spray.
Depending on the severity of salt spray given in NZS 3604:2011 Timber-framed buildings, NZS 4229:2013 Concrete masonry buildings not requiring specific engineering design , and E2/AS1 , the exposure zones are:
Exposure zone B, defined as low risk.
Exposure zone C, defined as medium risk.
Exposure zone D, defined as high risk.
Exposure zone E, which is close to breaking surf and has the highest risk.
Exposure zone E is not used in NZS 3604:2011 but is used in E2/AS1 for metal cladding selection.
To address the minimum compressive strength requirements for durability, NZS 3604:2011 paragraph 4.5.2 and NZS 4229:2013 paragraph 7.8.1 specify that the minimum 28-day strengths expressed in megapascals (MPa) for reinforced concrete and grout fill to concrete masonry are:
17.5 MPa in exposure zone B.
20 MPa in exposure zone C.
25 MPa in exposure zone D.
Geothermal hot spots require specific engineering design.
Concrete must comply with NZS 3104:2003 Specification for concrete production, and masonry must comply with NZS 4210:2001 Masonry construction: Materials and workmanship .
As a general rule, 20 or 25 MPa concrete is recommended. This gives improved performance for little additional cost – well worthwhile if the concrete is to be exposed during use in areas such as garage floors or where tiles are to be laid.
NZS 3604:2011 paragraph 4.5.1 specifies minimum cover to steel of:
75 mm for concrete placed directly on or against the ground.
50 mm when placed against formwork and the concrete has the strength requirements above.
30 mm for the top of an exposed slab protected from the weather.
50 mm for any slab surface exposed to the weather.
An alternative approach allowed by NZS 3101:2006 Concrete structures is to use 17.5 MPa concrete with 75 mm cover to the steel or 50 mm cover if a damp-proof membrane is used.
For concrete masonry foundations, the minimum cover requirements are:
45 mm in zone B and for interior conditions (17.5 MPa).
50 mm in zone C (20 MPa).
60 mm in zone D (25 MPa).
One of the keys to good-quality cured concrete is correct vibration after it’s poured. This compacts it and consolidates the mix by removing trapped air. But how do you get it right?
If concrete is poorly compacted and has air voids, particularly voids exposed to the weather, it will be significantly weaker and less durable than expected.
An immersion or poker vibrator will improve the compaction of all types and thicknesses of concrete construction. Even pump mixes must be vibrated, even though they may appear to be more readily compacted by the screeding process.
A vibrator with a head diameter of 20-30 mm suits most house slabs. It is essential that a poker vibrator is used for compacting concrete in walls. Place and compact the concrete in layers no more than 300 mm.
The keys to properly vibrating walls and slabs are to:
Make sure you can see the concrete surface.
Let the poker sink quickly – if done slowly, the top of the layer will be compacted first, making it more difficult for trapped air to escape.
Leave the poker in the concrete for about 10 seconds and withdraw it slowly to make sure that the hole made by the poker is filled up.
Repeat the process at the correct centres (see Figure 1).
Make sure that the poker head doesn’t touch the formwork face, reinforcing or DPM.
Compacting concrete with a vibrator takes place in two stages:
In stage 1, which takes 3–5 seconds, the concrete liquefies.
In stage 2, which takes a further 7–15 seconds, the trapped air is expelled.
Take care not to under-vibrate the concrete. Initial consolidation is rapid and the level of the concrete will drop, but this does not mean that all the air has been driven out.
Pay special attention to compacting concrete in locally thickened regions, such as perimeter beams and thickenings under load-bearing walls.

With spring upon us, and summer around the corner, we are entering the high-risk period for early-age concrete cracking – this is the first in a two-part series on how to help prevent it
Higher daytime temperatures and dry winds, along with low evening temperatures, are a perfect recipe for concrete cracks.
If you want to minimise the time spent investigating and rectifying this issue, you need to understand the causes and preventative measures you can take to avoid problems. This article looks at cracks that form in concrete in its plastic state – after it has been placed, but before it has set.
The formation of cracks in concrete is inevitable and can form prior to the concrete setting, or after it’s in its hardened state. During the setting stage, the moisture content of the concrete changes and water is given off, hence the concrete shrinks. This shrinkage leads to a volume change, and, as concrete has a low tensile strength, cracks will form if the change is restrained. However, appropriate measures can eliminate, or at least minimise, the formation of these unwanted cracks.
Cracks that form before the concrete has fully hardened (usually not less than about eight hours) are known as plastic cracks. Plastic cracking occurs as either shrinkage cracks or settlement cracks.
Once concrete is in place, evaporation can only occur from the free surface. In the absence of appropriate precautions, and in unfavourable drying conditions, the rate of evaporation at the surface can be greater than the rate at which water within the concrete can migrate to the surface to make good the loss. Sunny and/or windy days with low humidity levels pose the greatest risk of this situation occurring.
After concrete has been placed, vibrated, screeded and floated, it is left so the bleed water can rise to the surface. The slab cannot be finished until it is hard and the bleed water has evaporated. Bleed water appears within about 15 minutes of placing. The slab is then usually ready for finishing after several hours, depending on the concrete temperature. If the top surface is allowed to dry before final finishing, then plastic shrinkage cracking may occur.
The risk of plastic shrinkage occurring is greatest when:
The temperature difference between the concrete and air temperature is large. In spring, this type of cracking can occur in an area exposed to the sun, while shaded concrete remains uncracked. Concrete exposed to the sun can be significantly hotter than the air temperature.
Low bleed concrete mixes (eg, superplasticised mixes and/or mixes with high quantities of ultrafines) are used. The more concrete bleeds, the less likely it is that the surface will prematurely dry out. As such, greater precautions are required when using low-bleed concrete mixes.
There is low humidity.
There are high wind speeds.
The cracks usually occur either during finishing, or up to six hours after, and form without any regular pattern. They may range from 25mm to 2m in length and can be straight or jagged. Cracks often intersect each other to form T-junctions or acute angles. They vary in width, from a hairline to perhaps 3mm. Additionally, while they are surface related, the cracks may extend deeper with subsequent drying of the slab.
The most effective way to reduce the risk of plastic shrinkage cracking is to prevent rapid loss of moisture from the surface of the concrete. Practices to achieve this are:
Dampen the subgrade and formwork, while also ensuring any excess water is removed prior to placing concrete.
In hot weather, lower the temperature of the fresh concrete by using cool aggregates if possible.
Erect wind breaks to reduce wind velocity over the concrete surface.
Use polythene sheets on the top surface of the concrete to prevent evaporation and air movement. (These should be used with caution though when trying to obtain a consistent colour to the slab).
Use a proprietary evaporation retardant spray. These are inexpensive and provide a good degree of protection if used in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions.
Add polypropylene fibres to the concrete mix. The use of polypropylene fibres works by evenly distributing many small reinforcement fibres throughout the mass of the concrete in all directions and intersecting any micro-cracking that occurs when the concrete shrinks. Fibres are typically added at the batching plant and therefore their use requires planning. Your ready-mix concrete supplier will be able to advise you on the appropriate dosage.
Commence curing promptly after finishing is complete, and ensure the surface is subject to continuous curing. Providing a fog mist spray to increase humidity above the concrete is a good means of achieving this, although may be difficult to get a uniform application during windy conditions. It’s important excess water is not added to the surface.
In the next issue, we’ll go over plastic settlement cracking and how to avoid it.

Proposals from the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) to change aspects of design and construction in relation to concrete and steel structures have been met with industry approval
As part of its response to recommendations arising from the investigation into the performance of Statistics House in 2016 Hurunui/Kaikōura earthquakes and also due to recommendations made by the Canterbury Earthquakes Royal Commission, MBIE has proposed a number of amendments to the way concrete and steel structures are constructed and designed.
The proposal includes updating Verification Method B1/VM1 to cite changes made to NZS 3101:2006 Concrete Structures Standard and NZS 3404 Steel Structures Standard .
Rob Gaimster, Chief executive of Concrete NZ – an industry body recently formed through the amalgamation of six industry associations –  said that overall his organisation is “quite happy” with the proposals.
“We welcome MBIE inviting consultation on its proposals and overall we’re supportive of the recommendations, particularly with regards to NZS 3101 ,” said Rob.
Pulling pigtails
An example of the pigtail, or loop bar connection that MBIE is seeking to ban
MBIE propose a ban on the use of ‘pigtail loops’ in pre-cast flooring. Loop bar connections, known colloquially as ‘pigtail loops’, are used in commercial construction to support pre-cast concrete flange-hung double-tee flooring units. However, Rob says that his association’s members have not used the method since 2010 because more efficient methods became available.
“It is a specific detail for a precast system and our members have replaced it with more sophisticated methods; however, I can’t vouch for what people who aren’t part of our organisation are doing.”
MBIE has proposed the ban after an expert panel found it was a contributing factor in the collapse of some floor units in buildings affected by the Kaikoura earthquake. If issued, the ban is expected to come into force at the start of February 2018. The ban applies to consents issued from that date.
This is the second ban issued by MBIE who are at pains to point out the ban would not apply to building consents specifying pigtail loops which were issued before the ban came into effect. In that case MBIE advise the Council can’t require a change of product or method during construction and a code compliance certificate would be issued provided the building had been “built to consent” and all other necessary requirements were met.
Proposed changes to B1/VM1
B1/VM1, which cites NZS 3101:2006: Concrete Structures Standard and NZS 3404:1997: Steel Structures Standard , is a Verification Method for structural building design.
A Verification Method is not mandatory to use, but if followed, it provides a means of compliance for the building design. This makes the aforementioned standards part of an approved means to comply with the Building Code.
The latest version of NZS 3101:2006 addressed industry concerns over the potential earthquake performance of pre-cast concrete floor systems observed in the 2010 and 2011 Canterbury earthquakes and the more recent 2016 Kaikōura earthquakes.
The proposed modifications to NZS 3404:1997 in B1/VM1 would update the Verification Method to be in line with the standards and practices currently used in the steel industry, and relate to:
Correcting references to Standards that cited in NZS 3404 .
Updating references for nuts, bolts and washers.
Steel fabrication.
Steel erection.
Modification of existing structures.
Architecturally exposed structural steel.
Parties affected by the proposals have until 5pm on 20 November to have their say on the proposed changes. For more information and submission forms, click here .

Warmer homes typically use thicker insulation, and this requires bigger wall framing. While R2.8 insulation is the highest practicable insulation value that can be used with 90mm framing, R4.2 insulation can be used in 140mm framing
There are slightly different rules around 140mm wall framing in NZS 3604:2011 Timber-framed buildings:
Stud heights can be increased over 90mm framing at the same centres.
140mm studs can be installed at wider spaces. For example, with loadbearing walls in extra high wind zones, a 140 x 45mm stud up to 3.0m length (height) can be used at a maximum spacing of 600mm – twice the stud spacing of a 90mm wide stud (see NZS 3604:2011 Table 8.2)
The maximum size of a hole or notch is 38mm compared to 25mm for 90mm framing. (In each case, the measurement is 27% of the timber depth. The actual 38mm figure doesn’t appear in NZS 3604:2011 – it is derived from that.)
140 mm trimming studs can be made with a built-up thickness of 2/70mm or 6/35mm.
Where there is built-up framing with up to six framing members nailed together, for framing 140mm or more, there must be at least two rows of nails across the member width.
Apart from allowing thicker insulation, 140mm wall framing offers designers more flexibility around the size and position of plumbing and electrical services.
The 140mm framing and R4.2 insulation comes at a cost. One researcher looking at actual houses being built calculated additional costs of $6,200–8,700 per house above the typical construction of 90mm framing/R2.8 insulation. That would help achieve an 8-Homestar rating, however, which is considerably higher than most houses built today (see BRANZ Study Report SR391).

F lexible wall underlays – often referred to as building wraps, wall wraps or building paper – are an integral part of wall cladding systems for timber and steel-framed buildings. Fixed directly to the studs, they act as a second line of defence against water entry into framing and, in some instances, may function as an air barrier.
The specific wall underlay to be used on a project should be identified in the consent documents – it should not be left to the builder onsite to decide what to use.
E2/AS1 requires a wall underlay to be installed behind all external wall claddings and the underlay to meet the Table 23 absorbency performance requirements, where direct-fixed non-absorbent claddings are used. Table 23 references NZS 2295:2006 , which sets the requirements for water vapour resistance (breathability), shrinkage, absorbency (a minimum absorbency requirement in Table 23 of 100 g/m² only applies for direct-fixed non-absorbent claddings), water resistance, pH extract, mechanical strength and UV resistance.
Permeable or breather-type underlays allow air/vapour to flow through the membrane, enabling vapour pressure equalisation while resisting water movement. Note that water vapour resistance (the inverse of permeability) is the ability of a material to resist the passage of water vapour.
Where a flexible wall underlay is used as an air barrier – that is, where there is no internal wall lining (such as in an unlined gable end wall) or the internal lining is not airtight – the underlay must also meet specific performance requirements given in Table 23 for an air barrier. This also includes additional requirements for edge tear strength and air resistance.
To be called fire retardant, a flexible underlay must have a flammability index (FI) of 5 or less when tested to AS/NZS 1530 Part 2 .
Options for flexible wall underlay materials include:
• Kraft paper – bitumen impregnated or fire retardant.
• Synthetic – fire retardant or non-fire retardant and/or absorbent or non-absorbent.
Kraft papers are classified as absorbent. Synthetic underlays can be either absorbent or non-absorbent.
Claddings are also defined as being absorbent or non-absorbent. Absorbent claddings include timber, plywood, fibre-cement sheet and stucco. Profiled metal and plastic are non-absorbent cladding materials.
Absorbent wall underlays may be used with all claddings in both direct-fix and drained and vented cavity situations.
Non-absorbent wall underlays may be used with:
• Absorbent claddings that are direct fixed.
• Non-absorbent and absorbent claddings for drained cavity construction – the battens provide separation between the cladding and the underlay.
E2/AS1 requires kraft paper underlay to be used with direct-fixed vertical profiled metal claddings.
For horizontal profiled metal cladding, which must always be installed over a drained and vented cavity under E2/AS1, a kraft paper underlay must be installed between timber cavity battens treated with a copper-based timber preservative and the metal cladding. Alternatively, instead of full underlay over the battens, strips of kraft paper roof or wall underlay may be fixed to the face of the timber cavity battens.
Synthetic underlays are:
• Available in wider rolls – up to 2.7 m wide
• Translucent – useful during construction when the building has been enclosedin underlay and before window and door cut-outs have been made.
• More resistant to tears and puncturing.
• More tolerant of dampness.
Wall underlays are easily identifiable:
• Bitumen-impregnated kraft paper is black.
• Fire-retardant non-bituminous kraft paper is orange/brown.
• Non-absorbent synthetic wall underlay is thin and may be noisier in the wind once fixed and before claddings are installed.
• Absorbent synthetic wall underlay is generally thicker and softer than non-absorbent synthetic wall underlay and is less likely to be noisy in windy conditions.
Flexible flashing tape installed around openings and penetrations must be compatible with the wall underlay being used and installed as shown in E2/AS1.
Flexible wall underlay fixings (in accordance with NZS 2295:2006 ) may be temporary or permanent:
• For masonry veneer cladding, fixings must be permanent without any reliance on the cladding to hold the wall underlay in place. For veneer claddings, the wall underlay requires not less than 50 years’ durability.
• For other claddings, initial fixing may be temporary – permanent fixing occurs when the cavity batten or wall cladding is fixed. The fixing for the temporary attachment depends on the cladding type, time until cladding installation and expected weather conditions over this time. Secure wall underlay by stapling or screwing to framing members at 300 mm centres.
• For drained and vented cavity construction, where the cavity batten spacing exceeds 450 mm, the wall underlay must be restrained to prevent it bridging the cavity when the insulation is installed. Options include installing an additional vertical batten, taut polypropylene tape or galvanised wire horizontally over the underlay at 300 mm centres maximum, or covering the wall underlay with 75 mm galvanised mesh or wire. The ends of the tape, wire or mesh must be fixed securely at door and window openings.
• For drained and vented cavity systems, flexible wall underlay is installed before the cavity battens.
All current wall underlays have a maximum weather or UV exposure specified (typically one or two months) to ensure the underlay is sound and will remain durable when the cladding covers it.
NZS 2295:2006 also specifies a maximum weather exposure for the different classifications of flexible underlay.
The exposure limits may influence the underlay selection – particularly on larger complex projects, where there may be a time lapse between the wall underlay installation and the cladding installation.
The installation instructions for kraft paper-based wall underlays specify that they should not get wet before the cladding is installed.
While flexible wall underlays are water resistant, they are not waterproof and should never be used as a weatherskin to allow insulation and linings to be completed before the cladding is installed.
Most synthetic wraps have a BRANZ appraisal. Make sure you check for any conditions of use and what companion products are used with it. Always follow the installation instructions of the supplier.
It’s important to understand how each specific product should be installed.

It is important that holes for pipes that penetrate from the building interior through the exterior cladding are constructed in the correct sequence to maintain weathertightness
Simple penetrations are often installed after the cladding assembly has been completed, which leads to potential water entry.
All components that penetrate the exterior cladding should be installed before the cladding installation. This ensures that an interior air seal can be installed and that the penetration can be adequately sealed to the exterior face of the wall underlay. This provides an efficient drainage path for moisture that may get through the cladding assembly and onto the wall underlay.
Following installation of the cladding, all required weather and air seals are installed to ensure the penetration is weathertight.
Install everything in the right order
Step 1 – Install solid timber blocking to the wall framing in the required location. If possible, when a weatherboard cladding is being used, place the pipe so that it will penetrate through the centre of a weatherboard when installed.
Step 2 – Drill a suitably sized hole in the blocking and install the pipe. Ensure the pipe has a fall to the outside. Install an expanding foam air seal around the pipe to form a complete seal to the blocking.
Step 3 – Seal the pipe to the wall underlay with accurately installed flexible flashing tape, dressed to the wall underlay and around the pipe. Alternatively, use a suitably sized pre-formed pipe penetration grommet to seal the pipe to the underlay. Best practice is to install the flashing tape or grommet on the diagonal to ensure that potential moisture on the wall underlay drains more effectively around the seal.
Step 4 – Install the wall cladding – bevel-back weatherboards in this example – with a suitably sized hole to allow the pipe to penetrate the cladding.
Step 5 – Adequately fix a timber packer – formed from a weatherboard off-cut with a hole to suit the pipe diameter – to the face of the cladding with the top edge fitted tightly to the underside of the board above. Ensure the packer is sized to suit the pipe flange to be used, the end grain is sealed with paint and the face of the packer is at right angles to the slope of the pipe to ensure accurate installation of the pipe flange.
Step 6 – Install a suitable backing rod and exterior sealant to the diameter of the pipe flange and to the face of the timber packer as a weather and air seal.
Step 7 – Install the pipe flange, ensuring it is well adhered to the sealant or packer and there is a complete seal around the entire back flange.
Step 8 – Install suitable backing rod and exterior sealant to the gap between the circular pipe flange and the pipe.

Wet weather is common at any time of year in most parts of New Zealand, making the damage caused by rain to freshly placed concrete a real possibility
The symptoms are dependent upon when in the placing process the rain arrived. If the concrete has been floated and trowelled, and is nearing setting, the damage may be limited to some marking of the surface.
If the rain arrives prior to trowelling, there is a real risk that the surface will, at a later date, start to dust. The image below shows a driveway where rain occurred during the finishing process and dusty surface has resulted. Over a period, the dusting surface was abraded in the wheel tracks, exposing the aggregate.
Why dusting occurs
The strength of concrete is directly related to the water/cement ratio. The higher the ratio (ie, the more water added), the weaker the concrete. When water, either from rain or the bleed water, is mixed into the surface during the finishing process, a very weak concrete layer is created.
Typically, this weak layer is 3-5 mm thick and the concrete below is usually sound. It is this weak surface layer that is the source of the dust created by surface abrasion.
What can be done to prevent it?
The simplest answer is to avoid placing concrete when there is a threat of rain. However, there are times when rain occurs despite the forecasts for good weather. In these instances, it pays to have a contingency plan. Under clause 7.1.3.2 of ( NZS 3109 Concrete Construction ), the contractor has a responsibility to protect freshly cast concrete from the effects of rain.
For trowelled surfaces, one option is to lay polythene over the concrete surface as soon as the rain starts, and then wait for it to cease. When the rain has stopped, the polythene should be rolled back from a small area at a time and then finished. Use the moisture in the slab to finish and avoid the addition of any water to the surface during the finishing process.
This process is repeated until the entire slab has been finished. Do not pull the polythene off the entire surface in one go, as invariably the surface will dry and become unfinishable. It is important to ensure that any water sitting on the top of the polythene is not discharged onto the concrete. Start the curing process as soon as possible after finishing.
If a prolonged period of rain has occurred, better results can be achieved by using a rotating plate compactor to bring the fat up to the surface then machine finish as normal. Pan floating may help if a rotating plate is not available.
For decorative concrete, particularly stamped concrete, potential practical contingency plans are limited, as there is only a relatively small window of opportunity to conduct the stamping process.
You have a dusting surface — what can be done?
The answer depends on the severity of the problem and how quickly remedial action is taken. For situations where the dusting problem is not severe, and the problem is addressed early, the surface may be saved using a dust proofer and surface hardener. These are typically clear silicate-based solutions that are poured and broomed/squeegeed into the surface.
These solutions may not save a moderate to severe dusting surface, but as the cost is modest compared to other options, it may be worth trialling. If the surface has been left for a period of time and wear has exposed the aggregate, this solution is no longer available, as it will not hide the aggregate, so it is important to both acknowledge the problem and take action early.
Another remedial solution is to grind off the weak surface layer. This can create a rather attractive terrazzo effect. However, given that the floor was not intended to be ground, it would be unreasonable to expect an even distribution of the aggregate.
If a terrazzo appearance is not desired, then the weak surface layer can be removed by grinding, and a cementitious topping placed over the surface. These toppings can often be coloured and textured.
In some instances, the only practical solution is to rip the concrete up and start again.

Townhouses and apartment buildings are here to stay, but architect and Senior Lecturer at Victoria University, Guy Marriage, says we need to design and build them to far higher standards than we do now. In part one of a new series looking at designing and building medium-density housing, we look at inter-tenancy walls
M edium-density housing (MDH) has one major design difference from stand-alone housing – the need for inter-tenancy walls (ITWs). Never think of these as just another wall because they have special requirements.
What is an inter-tenancy wall?
The ITW between one unit and another is a legal boundary. It is required to have a fire resistance rating and attain a satisfactory level of acoustic separation. Correct construction of the wall is not only a legal requirement – it influences the comfort of future occupants.
Frustratingly, the New Zealand Building Code says little about the needs of the ITW. By comparison, in the UK, there is a separate Act of Parliament regarding the party wall, where the party wall has its own rights. In our legislation, the situation is at best vague and at worst largely ignored.
We are so unused to the concept of this type of wall that we don’t even have an official name, so I’ve selected the three-letter acronym of ITW. Others may refer to it as a party wall or a unit title wall, but the Unit Title Act is vague about the legal standing of the wall – being unclear about where exactly the legal boundary sits although, obviously, it should sit bang in the middle of the wall.
In the UK, many millions live in terraced housing with party walls constructed from solid brick, and the legal boundary lies in the middle of the brick. Sometimes, they will have two separate walls of brick, and the legal boundary lies in the void between the walls.
In New Zealand, because of our seismic situation, we do not build ITW of brick. Instead, we have a large array of possibilities for construction of the ITW – generally centred around the concept of twin walls.
Construction and material options
In the book Medium , we cover some of the possible construction options for ITW, all of which are slightly different.
Some have a central fire-rated wall element with two self-supported timber walls, one each side (see Figure 1). This central element could be made from a special plasterboard barrier or perhaps an interlocking steel and concrete panel system or even a poured in situ concrete central divider.
Other systems may be made with lightweight concrete blocks fixed together. Some architects may still prefer to design the wall from precast concrete slabs or to create the wall from scratch via traditional concrete block construction.
The one construction system that is no longer used is the traditional single skin of timber construction with plasterboard either side, as that simply will not meet the acoustic, fire or legal performance requirements.
Legal boundary with joint responsibility
Whatever construction system is selected, it must run horizontally from front to back, usually in a continuous straight line. This is the legal boundary so any alterations will need to be on the surveyor’s final boundary plans or, in the case of multi-unit apartment buildings, on the unit title plan.
This legal boundary also extends straight up from the foundations to the top of the roof. The exact position of the legal boundary sometimes gets a little trickier at the front or back of the medium density housing unit, especially if one unit sits proud of its neighbour or if the dividing wall projects out to form a protruding lip.
Even if the development is detailed so that one unit appears to have the protruding lip and the other unit is recessed behind, the ITW is still in joint ownership and both units have a legal responsibility for that wall. Further, the waterproofing for that protruding lip must be legally supported by each side.
Design wall to remain standing
As designers and builders construct the wall, they need to remember that, if one unit was to be removed in future years, the remaining portion of the wall needs to remain standing despite the lack of support. For example, perhaps one unit has to be demolished after suffering a fire.
That’s why ITW systems with a central barrier of plasterboard, autoclaved aerated concrete panels or other interlocking systems still need to have connection and support from both sides of the wall.
Treat entire assembly as a legal entity
Having designed and built your ITW, you now need to make sure that you don’t mess it up. What is the status of the wall ? Is it just the middle part that is the legal boundary ? Does one side have more rights than the other side ? Is it the whole assembly that is now the ITW ?
Again, the Building Code, the Unit Titles Act and surveyors’ opinions are all a bit vague on this. Until we have a law change over this aspect, it will remain a bit confused, but it is probably best to err on the side of caution and treat the entire assembly as a legal entity.
Avoid penetrations
That means trying to avoid poking holes in it and stringing wires and pipes through it. Yes, you do this for other walls – and legally there is nothing to stop us – but remember that this is no ordinary wall. It is an ITW. Every penetration you make lessens the acoustic and fire-rating properties of that wall as well as interfering with a wall system that one day will probably have its own legal rights and responsibilities.
I encourage you to respect the legal status of the ITW and make sure that you keep the wiring and plumbing completely within each separate unit. The usual rules for a stand-alone house do not apply here.
Aim for better acoustic rating
The enjoyment of each owner in their own space either side of the wall depends on achieving at least the minimum fire resistance rating required of the wall and the minimum acoustic rating of the sound transmission class (STC) between the two units.
Remember, the Building Code sets a low bar when it comes to STC. Instead of aiming to have a wall that just meets STC 55 in theory and probably only 50 in practice, your ITW should be aiming to reach 65 or more in theory and should have the confidence to achieve that in practice as well.
After all, if one person living in one unit enjoys Debussy and their neighbour likes drum and bass, their mutual enjoyment relies on you having really good separation – not by good luck or chance but by good design and great construction.

This article highlights two issues found in timber-framed building work that are common in complaints about LBPs to the Building Practitioners Board and in enquiries to MBIE’s technical team
The following two issues arise in a number of complaints:
Holes and notches to studs and joists.
Foundation set-out
Handy reference guide to NZS 3604:2011
These issues relate to NZS 3604:2011 Timber-framed Buildings .
This Standard is a core compliance document for those involved in building work. A helpful reference guide containing selected extracts from this Standard is also available: SNZ HB 3604:2011 Timber-framed Buildings Handbook (the Handbook).
This Handbook provides users with a collection of figures and tables extracted from NZS 3604:2011 that are commonly used on-site or in the design office. SNZ HB 3604:2011 has been designed as an ‘on-site reference guide’ and should prove a useful resource for those who don’t have ready access to the full version of standard.
MBIE has sponsored the handbook, so it is now free to download from the Standards New Zealand website.
Holes and notches to studs and joists
Achieving greater levels of energy efficiency in our homes has become more important. As a result, some common methods of construction have changed or been modified.
An example of this is the move from 90x45mm to 140x45mm timber wall framing in order to provide enough depth for thicker wall insulation.
Important note: NZS 3604:2011 (and the Handbook) provides notching and drilling limits for 90mm-deep wall framing. However, it does not give limits for 140mm-deep wall framing.
The limit for 90mm framing is that the maximum size of the hole or notch can be no more than 25mm, or 27% of the width of the stud.
Although not covered by NZS 3604:2011 , for 140mm framing the maximum size of a hole or notch would be 38mm (27% of 140mm).
You will note the 140mm wall depth can offer additional opportunities for the size and position of services that plumbers and electricians can run through holes in the framing.
References to checking and boring in studs can be found in section 1.5.3 of the Handbook and in section 8.5.1.6 of NZS 3604:2011 .
Remember, if you want to drill bigger holes in studs (or floor joists), refer to the full text in the Standard or make use of one of the proprietary supports available on the market to accommodate the larger diameter hole. Always drill in the centre of the stud.
Foundation set-out
A number of recent Building Practitioner Board complaints have considered issues relating to foundation set-out, siting or accuracy of layout of a house slab. The most common area of concern for foundation-related complaints is when the foundation set-out is found to be inconsistent with the consented drawings.
Modern methods of construction often involve foundation specialists laying the foundations and then the carpenter starting work after the slab is formed. This is an example of the move to greater levels of specialisation to help drive efficiency into the building process. However, it is important that clear communication is not lost in this process.
To be clear and avoid any doubt, always work to the consented set of drawings and, if there are differences within the working drawings or between the drawings and the work that’s been completed by a contractor, these should be raised and resolved with the designer, project lead and the building consent authority before work progresses.
A few common problems to watch out for include:
The foundation layout plan not being consistent with the wall framing assembly or other aspects of the consented drawings.
The layout provided by the truss and frame manufacturer not aligning with foundation design. This often leads to frames overhanging or falling short of the slab.
The finished foundation not meeting the dimensional tolerances required by NZS 3604:2011 . This means the slab and wall framing will probably not line up with each other. Refer to section 1.3 of the Handbook or section 2.2 of NZS 3604:2011 .
Complex, angular, stepped, or irregular foundation layouts, for which set-out is more difficult and problems are more common.
Tight or infill sites, which often have additional requirements with boundary clearances, building adjacent to easements, and the like, meaning that accurate set-out is even more important.
Find the standard and the handbook
NZS 3604:2011 timber-framed buildings can be purchased on the Standards New Zealand website. SNZ HB 3604:2011 Timber-framed buildings Handbook is free to download from the Standards New Zealand website. It has been designed as an ‘on-site reference guide’ and provides users with a collection of figures and tables extracted from NZS 3604:2011 that are commonly used on-site or in the design.

Sometimes two materials can’t be used close together because, due to their chemical composition, one will reduce the durability of the other
S ome common examples to be aware of when you’re working on site are:
A steel nail in damp timber that has been treated with a copper-based treatment will corrode faster than normal.
Rain that runs over western red cedar can leach acid out of the timber and corrode unprotected aluminium/zinc-coated or galvanised steel below.
E2/AS1 clauses 4.2.2 and 4.3 states that metals that are in contact in locations where they will become wet, or where water can flow over metals or certain plastics onto another metal, shall be selected in accordance with Table 20, 21 or 22.
Avoid contact between the following:
Stainless steel and hot-dip galvanised steel, aluminium alloy/zinc-coated steel or zinc.
Copper and hot-dip galvanised steel, aluminium alloy/zinc-coated steel or zinc.
Acidic cladding timbers (redwood and western red cedar) and hot-dip galvanised or zinc-plated steel. (Use stainless steel or silicon bronze fixings.)
Hot-dip galvanised steel, aluminium alloy/zinc-coated steel, zinc or anodised aluminium and copper azole and copper quaternary timber treatments. (Use stainless steel or silicon bronze fixings – galvanised steel is only suitable in closed situations.)
Aluminium and stainless steel in exposure zone D, except where the stainless steel element is small relative to the aluminium. (Using aluminium with stainless steel is permitted in exposure zones B and C.)
Hot-dip galvanised steel can be used with external CCA-treated timber in exposure zones B and C, and zone D for claddings that have not more than 15-year durability.
Compatibility of roofing materials
Rainwater will cause rust on unpainted galvanised steel if it first passes over glass, plastic or a painted surface. Rainwater is slightly acidic, and it contains carbon dioxide, which is mildly reactive to zinc.
This isn’t a problem until it runs over or through an inert material before hitting the zinc-containing material. Because most of today’s metal roofing is factory-coated aluminium/zinc alloy-coated steel, it doesn’t happen often, but it could be a problem in these situations:
You paint part but not all of an old steel roof.
You replace metal pipes that discharge onto a lower unpainted roof with PVC pipes.
You put a glass skylight or acrylic roofing into an existing unpainted galvanised steel roof.
Inert materials include glazed terracotta tiles, glass, fibreglass, plastics, colour-coated steel and painted roofing.
To avoid the problem, ensure that if you are using an inert material together with galvanised steel cladding, you run the inert cladding the full length down the roof. Check that rainwater from it runs into plastic, pre-painted or coated steel gutters, not galvanised gutters.

A project’s success depends on several relationships. In this article, architect Samantha Zondag details how to nail one of them – that between builder and architect
W hile there are a number of things we can ’ t control, such as pandemics and the weather, we can control our approach to site relations.
These i nclude relationships with and between clients, subbies, suppliers and consent officers, to name a few.
But perhaps one of the most important – yet often contentious – is the one between architect and builder. This relationship can be a source of frustration for both parties, but fostering an understanding that you’ll want to continue after the project is completed can be beneficial in more ways than one.
In full disclosure – I’m an architect and hence find the habits of my profession and brain relatively normal, but I am also completely aware that these aren’t necessarily conventional.
Here are some insider tips (verified and tested by my non-architect partner) to help you understand your architect better, so you get the most out of your relationship with them.
Visual vs kinesthetic learning
They say there are three types of learning style: visual, auditory and kinesthetic.
While most builders learn through doing (kinesthetic), the architects I know learn through visualising. This is emphasised during an architects training, where assignments are graded on creativity and aesthetic appeal, and the design and uniqueness of an idea takes precedence.
This visual learning and explaining continues into an architect’s profession,
where collaboration is done through sketching and the output of work is a set of drawings.
Visual learners, and therefore architects, understand through ‘seeing’ instead of being ‘talked to’ or ‘doing’. That leads me to tip number one: use visual aids to get your ideas across to an architect.
While a quick phone call might make sense, backing it up with a photo or a rough scribble will make all the difference to the visual brain of an architect and that on-site problem should clear up in no time.
You might even get a smiley face drawn in return!
Pencil vs power tools
Builders are experts in all types of power tools, whereas an architect uses pencil power to do their work.
Despite the remarkable development in BIM (building information modelling), CAD (computer-aided design) and computer technology over the past decade, there is still nothing like the immediacy of a 2B pencil sketch to explore and convey initial concept ideas.
Again, this is where architects and builders diverge. It is a rare architect who has intricate knowledge of building tools (if you find one, keep them) and generally architects have limited knowledge of power tools, be it brushless or brushed, impact driver or drill. So, while they can skillfully wield a 2B pencil, in most cases a power tool is a foreign concept. Just like builders do not know everything about drawing, architects do not know everything about building, and this is OK.
Which brings me to tip number two: appreciate each other’s strengths/differences. Architects and builders have their own unique strengths, and recognising these within each other and giving them (and their chosen tools) respect is what a great relationship is built upon.
Creative vs practical
No doubt there are times when an architect’s drawing can appear overly complex and a simpler, more practical solution is preferred by the builder. However, this complexity generally stems from the architect’s design intent, as opposed to them attempting to convolute the builder’s workday.
The design intent is the architect’s overall vision for the project, which can be conveyed throughout the drawings in subtle ways. For example, a common datum line amongst openings, the push and pull of volumes to create depth, or hiding gutters within a roofline to get a clean, crisp edge.
It is understandable that each drawing line on a page can look suspiciously similar for someone who hasn’t spent months or years agonising over every detail. But in the architect’s visual mind, each line has meaning. Some lines represent a key design element to be retained at all costs, such as a line to stop water ingress, while others are mere background players for council approval (not so interesting but still important).
A good architect will have put substantial effort into taking all these small details into consideration, so they can create the big picture the client desires. Therefore, omitting or taking shortcuts with the build process can be likened to not following a recipe. It just won’t taste or look the same.
So here is tip number three. Sitting down with the architect at the start of the project (or even during the design stages if early contractor involvement is an option) to understand the design intent is a great idea. It allows the builder to know what the key, non-negotiable elements are and which aspects could be compromised on for more practical solutions.
Open Mind
Architects can be great at mediating between different groups.
They are often the lead consultant and, prior to anything starting on site, must collaborate between clients who want to build their dreams, quantity surveyors pricing dreams into reality, engineers over-engineering the dream, and councils turning dreams into…well…nightmares. Not to mention navigating the well-known issues of lockdowns, market escalation, supply uncertainty and general chaos.
By the time a pack of drawings arrives at the builder, there is likely a whole host of decisions, complications, stops and starts that have occurred.
A drawing pack for a residential new build could take anywhere between six months to two years to produce, and the fact that a drawing pack has made it as far as the builder is a feat in itself.
Having come all this way, the architect (and client) are eager to see the drawings go from conception to completion, and the success herein lies with good communication and an open mind. Understanding from all parties is critical, as there will no doubt be times when either the architect or builder (or client) has screwed up and requires a favour.
Knowing that an architect is a visual learner, prefers a pencil over a power tool, and has given a ton of thought to the design intent of a project should help builders to understand them that little bit better.
The main takeaway, however, is that you are all on the same team – a team that wishes to create a beautiful and functional building for a shared client, within the ever-constant constraints of time and budget.

Once you start building below ground, the level of complication increases. With little opportunity to make repairs, getting the damp-proofing right the first time is critical
Leaks through basement walls below ground level can be extremely difficult to repair or locate. In some situations, part-height basement walls support the concrete slab of an upper floor, and the backs of these walls are impossible to access for repair once the floor slab has been poured.
This article covers damp-proofing of domestic basements on sloping sites that are no more than one level below natural ground and are not subject to hydrostatic pressure from groundwater. Typically, they are garage spaces but may incorporate habitable spaces. Construction is usually a concrete slab on ground with concrete masonry, in situ concrete, precast concrete or grout-filled poly-block walls.
These recommendations do not apply to basements that are:
More than one floor below ground.
Subject to hydrostatic pressure.
Continually wet.
Basements that fit any of these descriptions require a specifically designed tanking system.
A performance requirement of Building Code clause E2 External moisture is that walls, floors and structural elements close to or near the ground must not absorb or transmit moisture in quantities causing undue dampness and/or damage to building elements.
Clause B2 requires a durability of not less than 50 years for the waterproofing, as it is difficult to access once the building is completed. This means that the walls and slab need to be damp-proofed.
There are no solutions given in Acceptable Solution E2/AS1 , so all damp-proofing systems for basement walls need to be submitted for consent as an alternative method. However an Acceptable Solution for basement waterproofing details is given in Appendix A of NZS 4229:2013 Concrete masonry buildings not requiring specific engineering design .
There are a range of options for damp-proofing basement walls, including:
Liquid-applied bituminous coatings – brush, roller or spray application of: –   epoxies –   bitumen emulsions –   polyurethanes
Torch-on modified bitumen sheet.
Self-adhesive modified or rubberised bitumen/asphalt sheet with self-adhering laps.
Bentonite.
Trowel or spray-applied cementitious (sometimes resin-modified) slurry.
Damp-proofing options for slabs on ground are typically:
Polythene sheet.
Proprietary concrete underlays.
Torch-on modified bitumen sheet.
Self-adhesive modified or rubberised bitumen/asphalt sheet with self-adhering laps.
Bentonite.
“This article only covers damp-proofing of domestic basements on sloping sites that are no more than one level below natural ground and are not subject to hydrostatic pressure from groundwater
For concrete slab underlays or damp-proof membranes (DPMs) NZS 3604:2011 Timber-framed buildings specifies a maximum water vapour flow resistance of 90 MNs/g when tested in accordance with ASTM E96. NZS 4229:2013 specifies the same level of performance for wall damp-proofing material.
Complications that arise when waterproofing basements include:
Ensuring the continuity and compatibility of the damp-proofing between horizontal and vertical surfaces.
Restricted/constricted working spaces adjacent to walls.
Presence of water, particularly if subject to hydrostatic pressure.
Ensuring drainage of water from behind the walls.
The depth below natural ground.
Retaining unstable excavations.
Terminating the damp-proofing at or above the ground level.
Factors that can influence the performance of the damp-proofing include:
Incorrect product selection for the situation or substrate.
Incompatible wall and underslab damp-proofing that does not allow a sealed junction between the two.
The quality of the installation.
Damage to the damp-proofing during the backfilling.
Attempting to do the damp-proofing as cheaply as possible.
Contamination of the surfaces and materials due to the close proximity of banks and dirt
Material incompatibility.
The ideal solution is to specify the same damp-proofing material for the wall and under the slab to ensure compatibility. Also specify the protection board recommended by the damp-proofing supplier – proprietary protection boards are available that are designed to allow drainage, meaning water is less likely to impact on the damp-proofing itself.
Figures 1 and 2 give one option to ensure the continuity of the damp-proofing between the floor and the wall.
Figures 3 and 4 show the entire wall using a path adjacent to the basement wall, to allow the wall damp-proofing to be terminated at ground level.

Concrete screw-type anchors are increasingly used as a quick, simple and effective method for fixing bottom plates to concrete slabs
Initially designed as removable fasteners for fixing plant and machinery to concrete walls and floors, concrete screw-type anchors are a popular option for fixing timber bottom plates to concrete foundations in residential and commercial construction.
Screw-type concrete anchors offer some advantages:
They are quick and easy to install – a hole is drilled in the concrete floor in the correct location, the timber framing lined up above and the screw-type anchor installed using either a power driver or manual socket or wrench.
They can be removed easily if necessary – with no wedge, sleeve or adhesive holding them in place, they simply screw out.
They put less stress on the concrete – as the screw-type concrete anchors do not have an expanding wedge or sleeve, they apply less expansion force than wedge or sleeve-type anchors.
“Screw-type concrete can be removed easily if necessary – with no wedge, sleeve or adhesive holding them in place, they simply screw out
However, there are some items to consider when using any type of post-installed anchor in concrete foundations:
Does the fastener have the correct capacity strength to meet the requirements of NZS 3604:2011 Timber-framed buildings clauses 7.5.12.3 and 7.5.12.4?
If the fastener is to be used as a hold-down at the end of a bracing panel, can it achieve the required characteristic tensile strength for this task?
Can suitable cover to the fastener be achieved, especially in NZS 3604:2011 exposure zone D and where concrete and concrete masonry header block foundations are used? It may be necessary to specify stainless steel anchors in these locations. Figures 1 and 2 demonstrate how maximum covers can be achieved in two common situations.
Is the drill bit the correct diameter – if worn, the bolt can be hard to install and may damage the concrete.

It can be an expensive mistake if a house is not correctly set out on site. This happens too often, so here are some basics for getting it right
A house built in the wrong position on a section can cause major problems. For example, if built too close to a boundary, it may not meet district plan requirements or comply with the New Zealand Building Code requirement of a minimum separation distance to the relevant boundary or neighbouring buildings.
Non-compliance could be costly Those deemed responsible for the error can potentially be sued for thousands of dollars of compensation, while anyone adversely affected by a wrongly located building may sue for compensation.
Responsibility may be attributed to one or more parties, including the owner, building consent authority, designer or builder. To avoid litigation, it is essential that new buildings are correctly located on sites – as residential sections have become smaller, there is little room for error and accurate location is even more critical.
Survey the site Before setting out and establishing the exact location and relative height of a new building, an accurate survey of the building site is required to:
Locate boundary pegs or boundary offsets to permanent fixtures.
Determine site and boundary levels.
Establish locations of existing boundary fences and retaining
Establish position and level of relevant off-site features – for example, crown of road.
Locate relevant survey reference points – for example, lead plugs and site datum points.
Establish the location of existing underground and overhead services.
Establish the location of existing buildings, site features and planting to be retained.
Designer’s responsibility Once the site information has been gathered, the designer has the initial responsibility for locating the planned building on the site and must ensure that the proposed location complies with district plan requirements. These include checking requirements for:
Resource consent.
Site coverage.
Allowable total floor areas on some sites.
Location including:
Front yard
Side and rear yards.
Building set-back lines in some areas.
Permitted heights and building recession or sunlight access planes.
Describing the location The designer must describe the building location, using a reference point such as a boundary peg or other permanent marker, from which measurements can be made (Figures 1 and 2). The reference point must have dimensions given in two directions to enable the builder to establish offsets or locate a corner of the building. On rectangular sites, a wall of the building may run parallel to a boundary, but on irregularly shaped sites, this may not be the case.
A datum level that provides a reference to establish a relative building height must also be selected. This may be a permanent feature on or near the site such as a manhole cover or a concrete kerb.
The builder’s role On site, the builder must establish the location of the boundary corners. If survey pegs are not present, a registered surveyor should be employed to establish exact boundary locations.
Using a theodolite to measure from the selected reference point, the location of the first corner of the building may be determined. A building line marking out one side of the building – preferably a long wall – can be established, and a second building corner can be located on this line. The remaining external wall directions and locations can then be determined.
A dumpy level or theodolite can be used to establish the relative heights for the building from the datum level.
Building profiles Building profiles are erected to enable the exact location of the building to be marked out on site. They should be located outside the building perimeter, approximately 1.2 m but a minimum of 900mm away (see figures 3a and 3b overleaf).Profiles consist of braced stakes driven into the ground and connected by horizontal batter boards. The upper edges of the batter boards must be level with one another. The building lines that locate the perimeter walls of the proposed building are marked out by string lines tied to nails driven into the top edge of the batter boards. The string lines should run at least 20mm above floor joists or finished floor slab level to be clear of the construction.
The theodolite A theodolite is used to measure horizontal and vertical angles and distances. It consists of a telescope that pivots around both horizontal and vertical axes. Modern theodolites are integrated with an electronic distance measurement (EDM) device.
Before the use of the theodolite, triangulation – also called the 3-4-5 triangle rule – was used to establish 90° angles. This rule states that, if a triangle has sides of 3, 4 and 5 units long respectively, the angle opposite the longest side will always be a right angle – that is, a 90° angle (Figure 3b).

Recent calls to the BRANZ helpline asked about the implications of removing a section of bottom plate from wall framing. Good planning is needed to avoid this as it compromises the wall’s loadbearing integrity and means it will no longer act as a bracing wall
A BRANZ helpline caller described having seen a situation where a section of bottom plate was removed to accommodate service pipes through the wall framing. They had concerns about the effect on the structural and bracing integrity of the wall and how it affected the wall’s thermal and airtightness capability.
Turns out they were right to be concerned. Read more about why below.
Poor planning often a cause The first question to be asked is why sections of bottom plate are being removed from wall framing at all. The reasons usually involve poor planning:
Designers not considering where service pipes will be located, instead leaving decisions to tradespeople.
Tradespeople not understanding the implications of removing sections of wall framing.
Insufficient oversight on the construction site – there is often no one person who has overall responsibility for the building work.
Owners/clients not wanting to see service pipes on the outside (or inside) of the building.
The bottom plate has an important function The function of a bottom plate is to connect the wall to the floor. Vertical loads are transferred downwards and evenly distributed through the whole wall. The only area of wall framing where there are no bottom plates should be at doorway openings, which are designed so that vertical loads are transferred down on either side of the opening.
When a section of the bottom plate is removed, the load is no longer evenly distributed down through the whole wall, compromising the wall’s loadbearing integrity. The wall can no longer be used as a bracing wall over its entire length, and the bracing layout for that storey will need to be redesigned around what is left.
NZS 3604 requirements for bottom plates NZS 3604:2011 Timber-framed buildings states that bottom plates must be supported by timber floor framing or a concrete floor slab. It sets out fixing requirements for:
Timber floor framing – nailing according to Table 8.19.
Concrete slab floor – cast-in anchors or proprietary post-fixed anchors according to paragraph 7.5.12.
Holes or notches in bottom plates NZS 3604:2011 does not describe any situations where a section of bottom plate may be removed.
It does describe fixing requirements where holes or notches are cut into bottom plates. Paragraph 8.7.5.2 states that, where a hole or notch is more than 50% of the width of the bottom plate, the plate must be fixed against sideways movement with one 100 × 3.75 mm nail on each side of the hole or notch (Figure 1). This applies to bottom plates fixed to timber floor framing only.
There are no options for securing a bottom plate with a hole or notch cut in that is fixed to a concrete floor slab. This suggests that the intent is that there should not be any holes or notches cut into the bottom plate.
Cutting into other parts of wall framing A vent pipe is sometimes also required to be installed with a wastepipe, passing through the dwangs and top plate of the wall framing. This means that, where a bottom plate has been cut, notched or even removed, more of the wall framing may also have been removed, undermining even further the integrity of the wall framing.
Good planning required Good planning at the design stage of a building project is the solution to avoid the need to remove sections of bottom plate.
The initial responsibility for the location of service pipes lies with the designer. They should consider at the design stage how services such as wastepipes and vents can be accommodated in the building design without compromising the building structure.
Options to ensure that service pipes do not need to be located within the wall framing include:
Locating rooms requiring pipework such as kitchen, bathrooms and laundry in close proximity to one another and incorporating a service duct through which the pipes can be run.
Locating fittings so that pipes can go down through the floor rather than the wall framing.
Alternatively, use deeper wall framing so that holes or notches remain less than 50% of the width of the bottom plate. This also allows for installing thicker wall insulation.
On-site management Contractors and tradespeople also have a second level of responsibility for ensuring that the structural integrity of the building is maintained. Recommendations for on-site situations include:
Ensuring that tradespeople know that structural elements such as bottom plates must not be cut through.
Consulting the architect/designer or engineer where a conflict of location of building elements occurs.
Appointing one person on site to have oversight of the whole project.
Following these steps will help ensure that bottom plates are not compromised during the construction process and ensure that the structural and bracing integrity as well as thermal and airtightness capability of the building are maintained.

Thefts from building sites are a problem nationwide, with losses ranging from small hand tools to 6m shade sail poles hauled out of the ground. Here’s what experts recommend doing to reduce the risk of loss and increase the chances of getting stolen goods back
Insurance companies say claims for theft of tools, equipment, and materials have been rising in recent years. Some thefts are a spur-of-the-moment grab of a tool left lying around, while others are planned operations that involve angle grinders for cutting locks, diggers for removing heavy items, and flatbed trucks for carrying them away.
Materials are a big target. Whole pallets of goods have been stolen in several cases, and some materials are stolen after installation. Tools, generators, batteries, and fuel are also commonly taken. Even if you are insured, you are still likely to be out of pocket after a burglary or theft because insurance excesses of $1,000 – $2,500 are not uncommon. Luckily, there is a wide range of things you can do to reduce the risk of this happening.
Site management
Ideally, you should plan site security in advance. A security plan that staff and subcontractors are aware of can help reduce the risks of theft. Having a secure site is specified in many contracts and is effectively required in the Health and Safety at Work Act 2015. Under this law, contractors have a responsibility to care for others on the building site, even if they are not workers.
In practical terms, this means reducing risk by stopping members of the public from being able to access the site. This generally means good fencing and warning signs. While these are a requirement with many local authorities, there is no blanket requirement in the Building Act or Building Code for all construction sites to be fenced. Building Code clause F5 Construction and Demolition Hazards requires barriers where work presents a hazard in publicly accessible places and requires hazards that might attract children to be enclosed to restrict their access. This can help with security too.
Locks and lighting deter thieves. Invest in good-quality locks on garages, sheds, and containers. Smart padlocks are available that you lock and unlock with a smartphone. Overnight lighting around the site perimeter and at the main entrance and close to storage areas or machinery will discourage thieves and vandals.
Remove valuable tools and equipment from site overnight and at weekends. Where valuable items such as a new water heater or copper wiring or piping are left on site, they should be out of sight and well secured. Where trailers are left on site, fix a wheel clamp or towball lock.
Consider installing security cameras or contracting a security company to monitor the site. There is a wide range of options, including motion-sensor cameras and camera software that recognises known people and vehicles. If an intruder is seen on site, floodlights and horns can be activated to scare them off. Security companies can install continuously monitored cameras. Check that any private security firm you engage holds a company licence, any individual has an individual licence, and employees have certificates of approval.
If there are any neighbours around the site, meet them and provide them with a contact phone number to call if they notice any suspicious behaviour.
Daylight Robbery
Thefts can also happen in broad daylight, even with staff on site. Check the identity of anyone you don’t recognise entering a worksite. There have been several cases in recent years where thieves have brazenly entered worksites wearing work or PPE gear, pretending to be tradespeople, and driven away with valuable tools.
Where possible, arrange material deliveries first thing in the morning on the day they are due to be installed so they aren’t lying around for long. When you have removed the packaging from materials or equipment, don’t leave it in a visible location, where it might act as an advertisement that those goods are now on site.
Theft from vehicles
Don’t leave tools in a vehicle where opportunist thieves can see them, even if the vehicle is locked and even if you are insured. Insurance policy holders have a ‘duty of care’, which requires people to take reasonable care of their property, such as not leaving valuable items in vehicles overnight.
A robust lockable toolbox can be fixed into your truck and can have an alarm fitted to it. Park vehicles in a locked garage overnight wherever possible. Many tool thefts from vehicles take place when the vehicles are parked on the road or even a driveway. Ideally, bring expensive tools inside your home overnight.
Protecting Tools
Police strongly encourage builders to clearly mark tools for identification. Building companies can put company names and phone numbers onto tools, and individuals could put a driver licence number. The identifier should be engraved or burnt into the tool, so it is difficult or impossible to remove.
This labelling has two advantages:
Having a driver licence number or company name on a tool helps Police return stolen tools to their owners. In November 2023, Western Bay of Plenty Police were able to return five sets of tools valued at over $30,000 to their owners because the tools were engraved.
Thieves are less likely to steal well-branded tools in the first place because they are harder to sell or trade.
Keeping a register of your tools is a good idea and can help with tax and insurance as well as security. Keep the invoices/receipts for tool purchases. Take photographs of all your tools. Where they have serial numbers, keep a record of them.
An Auckland tradesperson, who had tools worth $10,000 taken from his van, was reunited with them after Police checking tools at a pawn shop identified them through the serial numbers.
For high-value tools or tool kits, consider tracking equipment such as low-power GPS tracking chips that can be used with a smartphone app. Choose the right system for the purpose – a low-end device designed to find your keys in the house might not be best to give real-time location updates for a toolbox over a wider geographical area.
These high-technology options can go hand-in-hand with old-fashioned approaches, such as encouraging workers to take greater responsibility for the tools and equipment they are using. Having a system where expensive tools or equipment must be signed out when they are used can encourage this.
111 or 105
If you see a theft or burglary in progress, or you think someone’s safety is at risk, call the Police on 111. To report a theft to the Police after the event, you can call 105 from any mobile or landline.

Maintenance isn’t just up to homeowners. Builders need to think harder about the maintenance of the buildings they construct following changes to the Building Act that came into force on 1 January
A requirement under the new Building Act is that, once a job is complete, the contractor must give clients copies of guarantees/warranties that apply to materials and appliances supplied under their contract, and inform them of the building’s maintenance requirements. This is required regardless of the contract price.
Information about the maintenance needed for any element of the building is required to:
Ensure that Building Code durability requirements continue to be met.
Fulfill any conditions set out in product/system guarantees and warranties.
Wall cladding and coating systems, in particular, are likely to need regular maintenance to remain waterproof and durable. Some cladding systems also incorporate functional components (such as drained and vented cavity drainage outlets) that require maintenance and, in some cases, protection to ensure that they continue to function.
The best way to help the new owners of a building keep it in top condition is to provide them with a maintenance schedule that lists the specific materials used and the maintenance they require. Frequency of tasks is typically described as:
Washing down painted weatherboard cladding at least once a year, for example, and repainting every 8–10 years.
A maintenance schedule can:
Help property owners know what they should do to keep the property in good condition and avoid potential problems.
Let builders and property owners find the details of a building material years after the property was built.
Reduce a builder’s potential liability if lack of maintenance leads to issues such as weathertightness problems.
BRANZ provides a considerable number of resources around maintenance, from Build articles to sections in books, bulletins and websites. BRANZ also has a maintenance schedule tool ( www.maintenanceschedules.co.nz ) that lets you put together a customised schedule for each new property.

As the dust settles after the introduction of the revised H1 requirements last year, BRANZ has continued to receive a steady stream of related queries about the ventilation of residential dwellings – especially roof spaces
The new baseline construction R-value for roofs of R6.6 continues to cause consternation for designers and builders, so we’ll look at some of the contributing factors and try to resolve some of the issues that have arisen.
BRANZ skillion roof design
The most common queries involve skillion roofs. Here, I consider a skillion roof detail we have been working on at BRANZ. Questions are usually concerned with how to design these roofs but, increasingly, they also ask how to keep the construction price reasonable.
Note that there are currently no Acceptable Solutions available such as NZS 3604 Timber-framed buildings or E2/AS1 External moisture with details, materials or dimensions for timber skillion roof construction, so any proposal submitted for building consent approval will be considered as an Alternative Solution. Designers should prepare supporting evidence that their skillion roof design proposal will meet all its performance and durability requirements to the satisfaction of the building control officer processing the application.
The first skillion roof design principle that BRANZ addressed was to ensure there are no gaps that allow warm or moist air to travel up from the habitable rooms below into the roof structure above. The biggest culprit here is usually recessed light fittings that penetrate the ceiling lining.
While there are airtight-rated recessed light fittings available, instead we incorporated a continuous taped and sealed airtight sheet lining with no penetrations fixed directly to the underside of the rafters.
To achieve airtightness, it could be a standard stopped plasterboard ceiling lining. But we used plywood sheet, which also provides additional bracing rigidity to the roof and ceiling plane. Note that this is a functional sealed surface that will not be seen, so airtightness performance will be more critical than the finished appearance.
Standard timber ceiling battens
We also retained the use of standard timber ceiling battens – 35mm thick at 600mm span – fitted to the plywood surface and then fixed a standard plasterboard sheet ceiling, providing an aesthetically pleasing visible ceiling surface to the room below. This surface can be penetrated, creating a void in the ceiling plane for recessed LED lamps and wiring.
For this skillion detail, we used 240 x 45mm rafters at 600mm centres – a relatively common size and spacing for timber skillion roofs in Aotearoa New Zealand – and utilised a generic glass wool insulation material fitted full depth to the 240mm high void between the rafters.
Vapour open membrane
We fixed a layer of vapour open roof underlay to the top edge of the timber rafters, snugly encapsulating all our insulation material between each pair of adjacent rafter.
The vapour open membrane is necessary to enable any moist air that makes its way into the insulation material to pass through and escape safely into the ventilated space above.
There is typically a small pressure differential (approximately 4Pa) between the interior space below and the ventilated plane within the skillion structure above. This will be enough to gradually drive the moist air up past the insulation material and through the vapour open membrane to the airflow paths, where it can be safely removed to the exterior of the building.
This membrane will primarily act as a wind barrier, preventing wind-wash occurring where the air moving through the roof cavity disturbs the insulation material and compromises the efficient optimum thermal insulation performance of the material.
It also provides additional protection should moisture or condensation occur in the roof void below the cold roofing material. If droplets do fall on the top of the vapour open membrane, they will run down the slope of the roof and exit to the exterior via the drained and vented cavity behind the eaves and fascia board (see Figure 1).
Figure 1: Skillion roof cross-section
Airflow pathways
The next layer in the roof plane is the most important. This is where pathways are created for air to flow passively up through the roof plane from:
The inlets at the eaves or fascia up through the airflow paths in the skillion rooftop outlets at the highest edge of the roof – a ridge with outlet vents.
A monopitch roof upper eave.
A junction where it forms a lean-to roof against an adjacent vertical wall or parapet.
Both the inlet and outlet vents must be carefully detailed to allow free flow of air, while remaining fully weathertight. We used the rule of thumb that the total cross-sectional area of inlet vents should be approximately twice the total area of the exit vents at the top, to maintain steady passive free airflow up the roof but avoid noisy rushing currents of air racing up through the confined spaces of the roof.
To maintain the airflow paths up the roof, we show a simple solution using a timber counter batten. On the top edge face of each rafter, we have fixed a continuous 45mm wide x 20mm deep timber batten to the full length of the rafter.
This lifts all the horizontal purlins clear of the vapour open roof underlay and maintains clear unimpeded air channels between each pair of counter battens up the full height of the roof plane. Note that the purlins will now sit 20mm higher above the top face of the rafters so the purlin fixings will have to be increased in length accordingly.
There are other methods of creating the airflow through this plane of the roof, including proprietary kit such as castellated purlins and battens – timber or synthetic material. Search for what is available. Some options may be more suitable for the specific requirements of your skillion roof design.
Detailing and further research
Above the counter battens, we revert to standard traditional roof design – cold roofing, such as long-run profiled galvanised steel on self-supporting roof underlay with the underlay draped beyond the fascia into the spouting.
Another detail worth mentioning is sealing the ends of the spaces between rafter pairs. Our drawing shows continuous bevelled blocking between the rafters but with the additional protection of continuing the wall wrap up past the wall to the top of the blocking, where it is sealed with a continuous length of tape to keep it airtight.
A further point of interest is that we used the BRANZ House insulation guide to establish the construction R-value of this detail. The construction R-value is R6.68 (see Figure 2).

We are fortunate in New Zealand to live in a moderate temperature environment, but in  many places morning frosts during winter are common
In the winter months, there is a range of issues to be considered when concreting. NZS 3109 Concrete Construction provides a definition of unfavourable cold conditions when concrete should not be placed.
These are:
When the ground is frozen.
At temperatures below 5°C  with temperature descending.
At temperatures below 2°C  with temperature ascending.
So, what is the reasoning behind the above temperature limitations?  Let’s first consider what happens to concrete at 0°C.
If concrete is frozen before it sets, the hydration of the cement is suspended, partly because the water within the mix freezes and expands, preventing the reaction from continuing. If the temperature rises, and the concrete is vibrated to remove the pores created by the ice, the cement hydration should continue, producing satisfactory concrete. This only remains true however, if the concrete is re-vibrated after the ice has thawed.
If the concrete has set but not reached sufficient strength, freezing can result in internal cracking and loss of strength. If the freezing only occurs on the surface, it may result in delamination of the top surface.
After concrete has attained a strength of approximately 3.5 MPa, it is usually considered to have sufficient strength  to resist a freeze thaw cycle.
The requirements of NZS 3109 give some protection against potential freezing of the concrete before it has attained sufficient strength. As a specifier or placer of concrete, what can you do to ensure a fit-for-purpose project in the cold winter months?
The best solution is to understand the fundamental principles of concreting in the cold so that the most appropriate solution can be applied to your project. The following are some general comments that are worth considering.
Never place concrete on frozen ground
In New Zealand, it should be possible to wait until the ground temperature rises before placing concrete. Alternatively, the ground can be protected overnight with straw or a similar material to prevent freezing.
Use air-entrained concrete
The advantage of air entrainment is  that it gives the concrete superior freeze/thaw resistance when it has reached sufficient strength. The concrete will still however, need to be protected from freezing until it reaches at least  3.5 MPa.
Consider the use of set accelerators
These will decrease the time to final set, meaning the concrete can be finished and potentially protected earlier. When the concrete is reinforced, it is recommended that non-chloride accelerators are used. Be aware that accelerators have limited effectiveness when mix temperatures are below 5-8°C. Also, be aware that overdosing with some set accelerators can in fact retard set, so ensure that the dose rate is that recommended by the admixture manufacturer.
There is a tendency in some areas to add set accelerators simply because it is winter, rather than based on the expected temperatures during placing and finishing. It is possible to get very warm, low humidity days in winter.  The indiscriminate use of accelerators can lead to problems with premature setting or plastic cracking.
High Early Strength (HE) cement could possibly be a consideration, although it is generally not stocked at ready  mixed concrete plants.
Protect the freshly placed concrete
In winter, there can be large changes  in the ambient day and night temperatures. This can lead to restrained early thermal contraction. The use of early entry saw cuts, or tooled joints, can prevent the formation of ugly random cracking. Some winter cracking suggests that the top surface has chilled relative to the body of the concrete, resulting in surface random cracking. Although the insulation value of polythene is negligible, covering  with polythene can potentially minimise the wind chill effect and prevent this type of cracking. If freezing conditions are expected and the concrete is unlikely to have attained a strength  of 3.5 MPa, insulate the concrete.
Prevent thermal shock
If the temperature is cold and the concrete warm, there is a risk that the removal of formwork can result in surface cracking. (A temperature differential of 20°C or more is commonly quoted as the range across which this phenomenon can occur). Always follow the minimum formwork stripping times specified in NZS 3109.
Use warm materials to make the concrete
The use of hot water and aggregates that have been stored in bins can mean that the concrete mix temperature is elevated, resulting in a faster setting time. Talk to your local ready mixed concrete supplier for options that are practical in your area. Never use water above 70°C, and be aware of the safety requirements of using hot water on a construction site.
Do not use unventilated heaters
The CO2 given off by some heaters can react with the concrete surface, producing a dusty, weak surface. Always make sure the exhaust gases  are ventilated, and do not aim the burner directly at the concrete.
With some simple precautions, it is relatively easy to obtain high-quality concrete all year round.
Concrete NZ is aligned with the New Zealand Concrete Contractors Association (NZCCA). To be a member of the NZCCA requires a high standard of knowledge and practical experience. To find out more visit www.nzconcretecontractors.org.nz

A seemingly simple step in the building process, installing smoke alarms is one that can often be overlooked in the final rush to get everything done – this article will help ensure you get it right
Between 2013 and 2016, approximately one in ten final building inspections carried out by the Auckland Council failed because of smoke alarms that were either installed incorrectly or not at all.
It’s not enough to just install smoke alarms in houses; to work reliably, they need to be the right type, installed in the right place and tested regularly.
Under New Zealand Building Code clause F7 Warning systems , a fire detection and warning system must be provided in all new homes and in existing homes when alteration work is carried out.
Some must-haves with domestic alarms
Acceptable Solution F7/AS1 stipulates that Type 1 smoke alarms are required for risk groups SH and SM, where no other type of fire alarm system is required. Risk group SH applies to houses, townhouses and small multi-unit dwellings. Risk group SM applies to permanent accommodation.
Type 1 smoke alarms are defined as domestic type alarms with an integral alerting device. They must have:
A hush button, so the alarm can be silenced for at least 60 seconds without cutting the power supply – for example, removing the battery.
A test button that is easily able to be reached by the building occupants.
A sound pressure level not less than 75dBA when measured at the sleeping position and not more than 100dBA when measured at 1.8m height (in accordance with NZS 4514:2009 Interconnected smoke alarms for houses ).
A range of domestic Type 1 smoke alarms are available that are either battery-powered or mains-connected systems. While mains-connected systems should be interconnected, this is not a requirement in a domestic situation.
Smoke alarms required in rental properties
Smoke alarms are now required to be installed in all residential rental properties. The landlord will be responsible for installation of operational smoke alarms in their properties, and tenants will be responsible for changing batteries and reporting faulty alarm systems.
Location important
F7/AS1 requires smoke alarms to be installed:
On every level in multi-storey buildings (see Figure 1)
Either in every sleeping space, or within 3m of a sleeping space door (the New Zealand Fire Service recommends smoke alarms in every sleeping and living space).
Where a single smoke alarm is installed, it should be between the living and sleeping spaces (see Figure 2) in a location that the alarm is given before escape routes become blocked by smoke.
At least two smoke alarms should be installed where sleeping areas are separated by living spaces. For optimum smoke detection, smoke alarms should be located on the ceiling or high on a wall in accordance with NZS 4514:2009.
Dead air spaces, such as corners and spaces near to exposed beams or other ceiling obstructions, must be avoided.
NZS 4514:2009 Figure 5.1 describes areas where dead air spaces may occur (see Figure 3). Install smoke alarms in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions.
A few places to avoid
Smoke alarms should NOT be installed:
In a kitchen, garage or bathroom (unless specifically intended for the space).
Near a heat source such as a stove, space heater or flue.
In damp or humid areas such as near showers or in saunas.
In draughty areas such as near an extract fan or air supply vent.
Different types of smoke alarms
There are two main types of domestic smoke alarm that detect smoke:
An ionisation alarm monitors ions or electrically charged particles in the air.
A photoelectric alarm uses a beam of light and a light sensor.
NZS 4514:2009 Table C1 sets out recommendations for alarm types in different locations (see Table 1). Smoke alarms with extra features such as an extra loud alarm sound, flashing strobe lights or vibrating devices are also available for people with hearing impairments.
photoelectric
Regular maintenance and testing needed
F7/AS1 requires that smoke alarms must be tested according to the maintenance requirements described in NZS 4514:2009. These include:
Monthly testing by activating the test function to check power supply and alarm sounding device
6-monthly inspection and in situ cleaning with a vacuum cleaner and brush to remove dust and dirt that may block smoke entry into the unit – do not use liquid cleaners or solvents as this may damage the unit.
Annual testing of the smoke-detecting element using a joss stick or commercial smoke alarm test smoke – do not test using a naked flame.
Battery-operated smoke alarms should have batteries replaced annually. The New Zealand Fire Service recommends picking a date that is easy to remember such as the beginning or end of daylight saving.
Replace every ten years
Smoke alarms may have a service life of about ten years. After this, they are likely to become less reliable and should therefore be replaced.

BRANZ CEO Chelydra Percy wants to clear up a misconception. While BRANZ does excellent work providing the industry with practical solutions, it is not a regulator and therefore not responsible for approving the use of products
I n recent months, the industry has hogged the headlines – supply chain issues, the plasterboard crisis and staff shortages have all featured prominently.
While it’s clear the pandemic was largely responsible for supply chain pain, that hasn’t stopped the odd bit of finger pointing. Fortunately, most industry players were focused on finding solutions.
The hue and cry has reminded us there can be confusion around the role we play in the building system. It has driven home how important it is that the industry understands what BRANZ can and cannot do, particularly regarding product regulation.
BRANZ doesn’t regulate products
Quite simply, BRANZ is not a product regulator. We do not approve products for use in New Zealand – for example, we were unable to solve the plasterboard crisis by simply approving new brands. Under New Zealand’s performance-based Building Code, manufacturers and suppliers must provide evidence of compliance with all relevant Code clauses. Ways they can do this include:
Providing technical product information.
Getting an independent product assessment.
Showing adherence with an industry-based scheme.
Having the product BRANZ Appraised.
Having the product certified – via the CodeMark scheme owned by MBIE and administered by JAS-ANZ.
Providing trusted independent information
BRANZ’s role in this is often misunderstood. We are just one of several companies providing product testing and assurance services on a commercial basis to manufacturers and suppliers. We also support manufacturers and suppliers to demonstrate Code compliance through any of the mechanisms listed above.
We understand the power of the BRANZ brand and the BRANZ Appraisal. We know there is strong reliance on a BRANZ Appraisal, test and assessment, and we are proud that our work is held in such high regard.
However, in some ways, we have been a victim of our own success, as the trust in our work has led to a perception that products can’t be used without BRANZ approval. We see architects, specifiers, building consent officials and even builders pushing back on companies trying to introduce new products, asking ” is it tested by BRANZ ” ?
New ways of doing things are now necessary
Whether it is driven by supply chain, climate change or just supporting innovation, the industry will need more alternative products or ways of doing things.
It’s great to see the industry already taking up the challenge. For example, bigger construction firms and developers imported plasterboard, and many BCAs supported the use of alternative products and designs. Manufacturers and distributors are also actively working on reducing the carbon emissions of their products.
This is heartening at a time when there is increasing awareness of the industry’s role in supporting New Zealand’s climate change ambitions. Everyone will have to be open to new ideas to ensure we continue to have a thriving industry.
What we’re doing
So, what is BRANZ doing ? We continue to work with manufacturers and suppliers, helping with product development processes and providing the necessary information to support their products in the market.
We provide robust evidence about material and product performance in New Zealand conditions, such as our recent work on structural insulated panels, and we educate on Code compliance pathways.
This work is central to BRANZ’s focus on providing practical solutions that assist the industry to tackle challenges, transform and innovate.

Avoid random cracking that can compromise weather tightness by ensuring movement control joints are properly located.
External plastered and textured finishes to framed buildings are popular in New Zealand’s housing market, but it’s essential that builders use well-located movement control joints to prevent cracking. This cracking could be a result of:
Building movement due to timber shrinkage, earthquakes or changes in moisture content.
Temperature changes causing expansion and contraction, particularly when dark finishes are applied.
Curing shrinkage in cement-based plasters – in particular, stucco.
Lack of movement control joints.
Movement control joints are an essential part of the weathertightness performance of an external plaster finish. They manage cracking by:
Creating lines of weakness at predetermined locations in the plaster, so that cracking occurs on these lines.
Forming a defined break or discontinuity in the cladding, such as a flashed joint.
The location of movement control joints will depend on the appearance of the building and the plaster cladding specified. They must be determined during the design of the building and shown on the consent documentation, not left to the plasterer on site.
Requirements for reinforced stucco over a drained and vented cavity with a rigid or non-rigid backing are set out in NZS 4251.1:2007 Solid plastering – Cement plasters for walls, ceilings and soffits. The maximum stud height for non-rigid backing is 2.4 m. Section 2.1.9 states that control joints must be located:
Vertically
– on both sides of openings 2.0 m wide or greater
– on one side of openings less than 2.0 m wide
(A vertical control joint is not required when the opening is less than 500 mm wide and the area of the opening is less than 0.2 m². Diagonal reinforcing will be needed at all four corners instead.)
Horizontally at inter-storey floor levels.
To break up expanses of wall more than 12 m² (locate them at not more than 4 m spacings vertically and horizontally).
At changes in wall cross-section or height.
At any point where natural flexing of a structure may occur, such as at the top of a plate level of a gable wall or where there is a cantilevered deck.
(See Figure 1).
Textured finishes (typically a modified cement, but can be acrylic plasters) may be applied over a range of substrates, including flush-stopped fibre-cement sheets, polystyrene (EIFS cladding systems, proprietary polystyrene block construction), clay bricks, concrete masonry and concrete. Although the requirements for movement control joints vary for each cladding type, they all require that any movement control joint in the substrate is carried through the plaster finish, so the movement control joint in concrete masonry construction or the substrate support changes from solid to framed construction.
For flush-stopped, texture-coated fibre-cement cladding, movement control joints are typically required:
Horizontally at each floor level.
Vertically at 3.6–5.4 m along the wall for timber-framed walls (7.2 m typically for steel-framed walls).
Above and below the jambs of openings.
For EIFS cladding, refer to the specific supplier’s requirements.
Vertical movement control joints are 10 -12 mm wide gaps between plastered sections and can be formed by the following methods:
Plastering up to an angle, T-section or proprietary joint former (see Figures 2 and 3). Materials for the joint former include hot-dip galvanised steel, powder-coated hot-dip galvanised steel, stainless steel, powder-coated aluminium and uPVC. Lath or wire mesh reinforcing must not be carried across stucco control joints.
Creating a sealant joint where the sealant is installed over a bond breaker or backing rod. (Adding a back flashing to the detail increases the robustness of the joint should the sealant fail.)
Creating an expressed open drained joint.
Leaving the joint open but covering with a vertical batten.
Stucco joints may also be created by a V-groove cut into the first (scratch) and second plaster coats before they have fully hardened, or plaster can be applied to a temporary batten. Joint edges that have been formed by cutting or inserting a temporary batten must be primed before the sealant is applied – sealant applied directly to the plaster will not adhere to the sides of the joint. Adding a backflashing to these joint locations is recommended.
“Movement control joints are an essential part of the weathertightness performance of an external plaster finish
To achieve a waterproof vertical movement control joint, it is essential that the sealant used is correctly applied. The gap must be filled with either a polyurethane, polysulphide or neutral cure silicon-type sealant inserted over a PEF backing rod or ond breaker tape (see Figures 4 and 5).
If correctly applied, the sealant should adhere to both sides of the joint and have a cross-section that is thinner in the middle than at the edges – this will ensure that the sealant can accommodate any movement in the plaster. A good sealant to joint ratio is 2:1; for a 10 mm wide joint, the sealant should be 5 mm deep in the middle of the joint.
Horizontal movement control joints are typically flashed (see Figure 6)

All BRANZ Appraisals are looked after by the BRANZ Assurance Services team, which includes some of this country’s premier Building Code experts
The BRANZ Assurance Services team started out in the 1970s with two people and has now grown to a 13-strong team. These days, the team is made of people from a wide range of backgrounds, including councils, manufacturing plants and construction.
How difficult is it to get a BRANZ Appraisal?
Achieving and maintaining a BRANZ Appraisal is a comprehensive process that can take anywhere from a few months to a couple of years, depending on the product or system. While it requires dedication, the effort is well worth it. So, why do product owners pursue it?
The clue is in the complexity of the process. Subjecting a product or system to the rigour of the Appraisals process demonstrates to the world that it’s up to scratch and carries real weight in the marketplace.
BRANZ is home to some of Aotearoa’s premier experts in various aspects of the Building Code. We pride ourselves in drilling down into the details of a product to make sure it is going to be suitable for New Zealand or Australian consumers.
BRANZ experts are also familiar with many international testing standards, so if as product has had testing carried out overseas, a BRANZ Appraisal can be the best way to have it recognised without requiring repetitive new testing.
Testing capabilities
You only need to look at the enormous new fire testing laboratory that’s recently emerged in the Wellington hills to understand how extraordinary BRANZ’s testing facilities are. When completed later this year, the fire lab will be the largest facility of its kind in the southern hemisphere.
Added to that, our Structures team also has a new lab, which can carry out two orthogonal directional testing on structures up to three storeys high. Further, our Materials team was at the forefront of developing weathertightness testing for the Building Code and has labs packed with equipment for accelerated ageing and durability testing.
Breaking the barriers to innovation
Getting a BRANZ Appraisal for a product or system can be a challenging process, but acquiring one is a stamp of excellence which demonstrates the product is up to standard.
Independent expertise for our challenging conditions
The government recently proposed legislative changes to make it faster and easier for building products certified as fit for purpose in ‘trusted’ overseas markets to be introduced here. BRANZ’s view on the suitability of any product for Aotearoa New Zealand’s uniquely challenging environment will always be guided by our science.
BRANZ agrees that Aotearoa needs more quality, affordable building materials in the market to help reduce costs and delays associated with building a house. However, it’s critical that those materials are safe, resilient and fit for purpose given the unique challenges we face from our climate, high UV levels and earthquakes.
BRANZ’s scientists, technicians and product auditors draw on their extensive materials-testing expertise to assess a wide range of building products. They work in world-class testing facilities that can replicate, accelerate or exceed the conditions that Kiwi houses can expect to face during their lifetime.
Among their responsibilities, BRANZ experts assess certifications and evidence from overseas tests against Aotearoa’s regulatory requirements and environment. This ensures products will meet our current building standards and perform as they’re supposed to.
BRANZ does not set Aotearoa’s building standards or approve products for use here. Those are responsibilities of the regulator and building consent authorities. Instead, BRANZ’s independent team works with product manufacturers, importers and authorities to provide robust scientific evidence of whether new materials will be safe and durable if used in Aotearoa’s buildings.

The second part of this article covers how to correctly prepare substrates for tiling and the importance of ensuring membranes are waterproof
C orrect substrate installation and preparation of tiled shower floors and walls are essential for the shower to remain fully waterproofed. Create falls during substrate installation.
Prep for tiling for floors
The minimum for suspended timber floors under a tiled shower should be one of the following:
H3.2 treated, 17mm thick minimum, CD grade structural ply with the C face upwards (LOSP-treated ply must not be used), supported at 400mm maximum spacings in both directions. Fix with 10 gauge, 50mm stainless steel, countersunk screws at 150mm centres maximum at the sheet edges and 200mm centres maximum across the sheet.
20mm thick, treated RWB, wet area grade sheet material supported at 400mm centres maximum and installed according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
19 or 22mm thick sealed, fibre-cement flooring installed according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
18mm fibre-cement compressed sheet flooring or 6mm thick fibre-cement sheet tile underlay laid over flooring (minimum H1.2 flooring or H3 plywood) and fixed according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
The substrate must not deflect more than 1/360th of the span under dead and live loads. For example, where L = the span between joists:
If L = 400mm
L/360 = 400/360 = 1.1mm is the maximum permitted deflection.
Concrete floors can have a rebate formed in the slab with the falls created using a mortar bed, or the falls can be incorporated when the floor is laid. A waterproof membrane should be laid over (not under) a mortar bed to ensure that the mortar remains dry.
Proprietary metal or acrylic tray-type shower bases, over which tiles can be laid, are also available. Install according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
They may require notching the framing or packing out the sheet wall lining material to provide the required waterproofing detail at the tray/wall lining junction.
The floor outlet, either a conventional waste or a channel drain, should be specifically designed for use with a waterproof membrane and tiles. Rebate flanges into the substrate to create a flush surface, so drainage is not restricted, and seal the waterproofing system onto the flanges (Figure 5).
Prep for tiling for walls
The wall substrate under tiles should be:
6 or 9mm thick fibre-cement sheet.
10 or 13mm thick wet area plasterboard.
A proprietary waterproof sheet material such as closed-cell polystyrene insulation board with a reinforced cement polymer mortar surface.
Fibre-cement sheet and plasterboard should be fixed with stainless steel screws at spacings recommended by the manufacturer. Fill the gap at the junction of the base of the wall substrate with the flooring substrate with a continuous bead of sealant and apply sealant around fittings and taps where they penetrate the substrate.
Proprietary waterproof sheet materials should be fixed to the manufacturer’s instructions. The waterproofing membrane must cover the sealant around each penetration (see Figure 6).
Range of waterproofing systems
Waterproofing systems available for interior tiling include a range of liquid-applied systems, such as:
Liquid-applied polymer (acrylic) gels or pastes.
Styrene butadiene co-polymer latex admixtures (SBRS).
Liquid-applied acrylic or latex-modified two-part cementitious coatings.
One-part waterborne elastomeric moisture-cured polyurethanes.
Glass fibre reinforced resins.
Reinforcement such as fibreglass, polyester mesh or chopped strand microfibre may be incorporated into the waterproofing material.
Also available are sheet waterproofing systems, such as:
Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) sheet material.
Chlorinated polyethylene (CPE) sheet material.
SBS (styrene butadiene styrene) – modified rubberised asphalt material.
Applying the waterproof membrane
All waterproofing systems will require application according to the manufacturers’ instructions by a specialist applicator for the warranty to be valid.
Liquid-applied membranes
Before applying liquid-applied membranes, prime as required using a primer recommended by the manufacturer.
Membranes must be applied according to the manufacturer’s specified number of coats to achieve dry film thickness and be allowed to fully cure between coats and before flood testing (generally at least 24 hours at 20°C).
Don’t apply heat to speed the curing process, as it may cause the membrane to skin while remaining uncured below the skin. Ensure the membrane has adhered to the outlet flanges.
Glass fibre reinforced resins are less flexible than other liquid-applied membranes, so they must have a rigid substrate. Bond breakers may be required at changes of direction.
Sheet systems
Flexible, welded sheet materials may require priming to aid adhesion. They are typically 1 -1.5mm thick and supplied in 900mm wide sheets. They generally need to be installed with 50mm side laps and 50mm end laps.
Joints, junctions and corners are heat welded and the membrane is heat welded to flange outlets. The wall sheet must overlap the floor sheet upstand.
They have advantages in that there is no drying or curing time, so tiles can be laid immediately and they can span small cracks in the substrate.
Protect and test
Protect all waterproofing material from damage before laying tiles. Once installed and cured as necessary, and before the tiles are laid, carry out a flood test to ensure that the whole area is fully waterproofed.
Tiling and grouting
Select a tile adhesive that is compatible with the waterproof membrane, and ensure that tiles and grout are compatible.
Spread the grout diagonally across tiles, forcing it into all joints. Remove excess grout with a damp sponge.
Apply a suitable sealant at the junctions between horizontal and vertical tiles. Also apply additional sealant around the tops and sides of fittings and tap flanges, leaving a drainage slot over the tiles at the bottom edge.
Finally, adding a proprietary clear sealer to grout will reduce moisture absorption.

BRANZ highlights a new method to achieve weathertightness at the junction between the soffit and the wall cladding at gable verge
Gables need to be carefully detailed and constructed to prevent wind-driven rain penetrating the junction between the soffit and the wall cladding. Follow this step-by-step guide to achieve a weathertight detail.
There is a two-fold weathertightness problem at the junction between the soffit and the wall cladding:
Gables tend to be higher and more exposed.
The cladding is cut to the angle of the roof pitch where it intersects with the soffit lining to create a wedge-shaped gap at each end of the boards.
Traditional compounds problem
The traditional way to construct eave and verge details is to install soffit linings before the external cladding. This compounds the weathertightness problem as the cladding is butted to the soffit lining, allowing any water running down the soffit to enter the gap between the lining and the top of the cladding. From there, it will run down behind the cladding.
Better to install weatherboards first
A better way to achieve a weathertight detail is to install weatherboards first. The intersection of the soffit lining and the top of the weatherboards can be effectively flashed and wedges installed to block the gaps between the weatherboards.
The sequence of construction is described in Steps 1–7 and shown in Figures 1 and 2.
Step 1 – Carry wall underlay up the wall framing and turn out over the underside of the flying rafters/soffit framing.
Step 2 – Install vertical cavity battens and raking cavity batten to close off the roof space.
Step 3 – Install bevel-back weatherboards up to the underside of the soffit framing. Ends of weatherboards are cut to match the angle of the roof pitch.
Step 4 – Fix minimum 45 × 45mm angle flashing to the underside of the soffit framing and over the weatherboards. For boxed soffit, fold flashing to form a stop-end at the bottom. Fit an additional angle flashing behind the fascia return.
Step 5 – Install the soffit lining by slotting it into the groove in the bargeboard and fixing to the framing.
Step 6 – Cut wedges to fit gaps at the junctions of the soffit and the weatherboards.
Step 7 – Fix a timber trim or cover batten to the intersection between the soffit lining and the weatherboards.

Growing awareness about improving safety has seen a significant increase in the use of safety nets on building sites – but don’t get caught out not knowing how to use them correctly
Figure 1: Safety net showing two nets joined with coupling ropes
Figure 2: Debris should be removed from the safety net
Safety nets are installed below elevated work areas to reduce potential fall distances and are designed to progressively deflect or stretch. If a fall occurs, the net absorbs the impact and provides a soft landing, reducing the likelihood of injury (see Figure 1).
The greater the height from which a person falls, the greater the impact. Nets must be able to absorb all the energy generated by falls from the maximum fall height they are designed for. Here are a few things to consider when selecting and installing nets:
Clearance distance – is the distance below the net that must be clear of objects, so that a person falling does not strike an obstacle or the ground while the net is deflecting.
Standards covering safety nets – there are currently no New Zealand standards covering safety nets. WorkSafe New Zealand has published best practice guidelines: Safe use of safety nets. This is available online and references the British/European Standard, BS EN 1263 Parts 1 and 2 .
Compliance – safety components and installation of nets should comply with BS EN 1263 or equivalent.
Knotted vs knotless nets – safety nets may be knotted or knotless in either a square (Q) or diamond (D) mesh arrangement. Knotted and knotless nets react differently under impact.
When a load lands on a knotted net, the knots tighten near the impact. The tightening is permanent and reduces the amount of energy the net can absorb in future impacts.
Knotless nets do not lose absorption capacity following an impact. They also tend to result in fewer facial or graze injuries when a person falls into them.
BS EN 1263 classifies nets in two ways (see Table 1):
The maximum energy absorption capacity – how much energy a net can absorb, measured in kilojoules (kJ). The capacity for class A nets is 2.3kJ; for class B nets it is 4.4kJ.
The mesh size measured in millimetres – class 1 mesh size is 60mm; class 2 is 100mm.
Safety nets consist of different types of ropes, including:
Mesh ropes – a minimum of three separate strands of rope braided in such a way that they cannot unravel.
Border ropes – a continuous rope that is threaded through each mesh around the perimeter of the safety net.
Tie ropes – fasten the safety nets to structural elements and/or anchor points on a structure.
Coupling ropes – join nets together when more than one net is needed to protect an area (see Figure 1).
All safety nets must have a permanently attached label with information about the net, including:
The manufacturer’s name and code.
Date of manufacture.
The class.
Mesh size.
Configuration.
Energy absorption capacity of the net.
A unique identity or serial number (ID).
If there is no label attached to a net or the label is not legible, the safety net must not be used!
Every safety net must be tested for UV deterioration at least once every 12 months. New safety nets should come with at least three test meshes, which are loosely woven into the net and can be removed one at a time for testing.
Each test mesh must have the same ID number, be made from the same material, and be produced in the same batch as the net to which it is attached. A label showing that the net has been tested in the past 12 months and that it meets the manufacturer’s minimum energy absorption capacity must be displayed on every safety net. The test label is valid for 12 months and must not expire while a net is installed.
Safety nets may be attached with either tie ropes or karabiners to structural elements, such as trusses, rafters and top plates, or to specifically designed anchor points on the structure being netted. They must not be attached to purlins, battens or non-structural components such as gutter supports, pipework or electrical service installations.
The recommended maximum spacing between fixing locations is 1.5–2m. Fixing locations and anchor points to which safety nets are fastened must not have sharp edges that could damage or cause abrasions to any of the ropes.
Only an appropriately qualified person should install safety nets. They need a fall arrest safety equipment training (FASET) certification – the only recognised qualification for safety net installation.
Before any work begins above safety nets, ensure there is a rescue plan detailing the procedure that will be followed if someone falls into a net.
Nets must be easily accessible, to carry out a rescue and to remove debris. They must not be used for storage, as a work platform, or for providing access to a work platform.
Any equipment required to carry out a rescue must be on site and available at all times. All workers on the site must know what the rescue plan is and their role in a rescue. If possible, a practice rescue should be carried out before starting work above the safety net.
Carry out regular visual inspections of the safety nets and keep records of all inspections on site. Table 2 outlines the required frequency of visual inspections. A visual inspection includes checking for:
Incorrect installation.
Mesh abrasion.
Cuts or nicks in mesh.
Heat or friction damage to mesh.
Damage to stitching.
Damaged or deformed fittings.
Debris in the net.
Defective knots – if the net has knotted mesh.
UV degradation – although this is generally not visible.
If a net does not pass the visual inspection, it must not be used; it should be removed and either repaired or taken permanently out of service.
As well as catching a falling person, safety nets will also catch falling debris. Debris can damage the net and becomes a hazard if left in the net, as it may cause:
Injury to a person who falls.
The net to overload and deflect too much.
The net to sag and increase the fall distance.
When debris falls onto a safety net, work should stop immediately above and below the net. The debris should be removed and the net checked for damage before work resumes (see Figure 2).
BS EN 1263 applies only to safety nets that are over 35m 2 , and where the shortest side is at least 5m long. On residential construction sites, individual safety nets are seldom bigger. Therefore, specific recommendations for safety nets that are less than 35m 2 include:
The fall height should be no more than 2m.
A class B net with 4.4kJ energy absorption capacity should be used.
Don’t store materials below the net in the clearance distance – sufficient clearance needs to be maintained.
Consider brace placement to maintain clearances.
The net should have an initial sag of approximately 5–10% of the shortest side of the net.

Using longer and thicker nails to fix horizontal timber weatherboards to structural framing through cavity battens can damage the weatherboards. However, there’s a way around this
The drained and ventilated cavity behind horizontal timber weatherboards is formed by nominal 20mm thick x 45mm timber cavity battens fixed vertically to the outer face of the exterior wall framing. The battens are fixed to the framing – primarily studs – to act as packers that form a cavity that keeps the back of the weatherboards clear of the wall underlay or rigid air barrier (RAB), which is fixed to the face of the framing.
The relevant Acceptable Solution
Under E2/AS1 , the Acceptable Solution for Building Code clause E2 External moisture , the battens are non-structural and batten fixings are required simply to hold the battens in place until the timber weatherboard cladding is installed.
The required fixings for the weatherboards are increased in length by 20mm (minimum) to ensure that the fixings penetrate through the batten and into the structural wall framing to the required depth. These fixings ultimately secure the battens in place.
E2/AS1 also incorporates Table 24 Fixing selection for wall claddings, which covers fixing length, diameter and type as well as the minimum structural framing penetration and fixing patterns for a range of cladding systems, including timber weatherboards. Fixings for both direct-fixed and cavity-fixed claddings are included in the table.
The downside of increasing the weatherboard fixing length to allow for the cavity batten thickness is that the shank diameter of the fixing also increases. This increase in length and diameter can then have a detrimental effect on the weatherboard, often resulting in cracking or damage to the face of the board. It is also more difficult to accurately install longer weatherboard fixings.
Solving the problem
One way of resolving this potential problem and maintaining the standard length/diameter for weatherboard fixings is to structurally fix the timber cavity battens to the wall framing. In effect, this laminates the batten to the framing, forming a nominal 20mm deeper framing member. For example, a 20mm timber batten structurally fixed to a 90x45mm timber stud forms a 110x45mm stud. This is not covered in the Acceptable Solution and will need to be submitted for consent as an alternative method.
To support the use of structural cavity battens, BRANZ testing has identified the type of timber batten required along with the fixing requirements. Using the correct fixing type and size ensures that there is sufficient structural resistance to prevent the batten fixings pulling out of the frame.
Fixings for different timber weatherboard profiles have also been identified. Timber structural cavity battens must be:
18-20mm in thickness.
Installed vertically to exterior wall framing (studs) where required to support the weatherboard cladding.
Kiln-dried, SG6 minimum, H3.1 minimum treated.
40mm minimum width – fixed on the centreline of the stud.
The battens must be structurally fixed to the framing with either:
Hand-driven 60×2.8mm jolthead hot-dip galvanised nails.
Power-driven 60×2.87mm D-head hot-dip galvanised nails.
Power-driven 64×2.8mm D-head stainless steel annular-ringed nails.
Structural batten fixings must be at 300mm centres maximum up to the very high wind zone and 250mm centres maximum for the extra high wind zone. Fixings should be staggered 12mm either side of the batten centreline.
Timber weatherboard fixings used with structurally fixed battens based on a flexible wall underlay must be:
75×3.15mm jolthead hot-dip galvanised (or stainless steel equivalent) for bevel-back and rebated bevel-back weatherboards.
60×2.8mm jolthead hot-dip galvanised (or stainless steel equivalent) for rusticated weatherboards.
Where an RAB is used, the weatherboard fixings must be increased in length by the thickness of the RAB. Where proprietary horizontal timber weatherboards are specified, follow the manufacturer’s instructions for the fixings and installation.
In all solutions other than those that have a current BRANZ Appraisal certificate or where the manufacturer has undertaken to have the cladding system specifically designed to meet the New Zealand Building Code, it is recommended that solutions for fixing cladding systems outside E2/AS1 should be covered by specific engineering design to suit each project.

BRANZ Technical Writer Bruce Sedcole covers changes between E3/AS1 Amendments 6 and 7. Since 4 November 2021, the revised Acceptable Solution E3/AS1 in Building Code clause E3 Internal moisture no longer includes use of timber or timber-based products as linings and finishes to floors in wet areas. However, an Alternative Solution designed and specified to best practice is easy to do
Queries are starting to come into the BRANZ helpline about recent changes to E3/AS1 , specifically the flooring options that will be available for household wet areas such as kitchens, bathrooms, laundries and toilet facilities.
E3/AS1 Amendments 6 and 7 were a means of compliance during the transition period from 5 November 2020. However, since 4 November 2021, only E3/AS1 Amendment 7 can be used as a means of compliance.
Flooring options in Amendment 6
Flooring options for wet areas were covered in E3/AS1 section 3.0 Watersplash , with the floor lining materials listed in 3.1.1 Floors. It covers linings and finishes to floors that satisfy the performance criteria for impervious and easily cleaned surfaces in areas exposed to watersplash.
In E3/AS1 Amendment 6 , there are six flooring options – waterproof sheet materials (for example, PVC), ceramic or stone tiles, concrete or cement-based solid plaster, cork tile or sheet, monolithic coatings such as terrazzo and timber or timber-based products such as particleboard sealed with waterproof applied coatings.
Some of the six wet area flooring options in Amendment 6 were reasonably vague in their descriptions, and some did not have a very good history in use or were no longer in common usage.
At the end of 3.1.1, there is a note that in ‘bathrooms used mainly by adults, carpet may be acceptable provided it is laid over an impervious surface’. It sounds a bit dodgy, but I once lived in a student flat that had a carpeted bathroom floor, and I think it was fine although it was hard to tell – the walls were painted matt black, and the light bulb was red!
Submissions on proposed changes
Last year, MBIE sought public submissions on the proposed changes to E3/AS1 . Most submissions related to other aspects of E3/AS1 – sections pertaining to overflow, freewater (accidental overflow) containment and changes to floor wastes.
The evolving style of our residential building stock may have been a driving factor for many of the submissions. The single-storey stand-alone dwelling is becoming less common, and we are seeing more multi-unit, medium-density housing projects springing up. The risk profile changes exponentially when a wet area water leak can affect rooms below and potentially multiple other adjacent tenancies.
Only a few comments were received on the change to wet area flooring materials and finishes. These included a desire for additional wet area flooring options – although those options were generally not backed by generic material and installation requirements.
Fewer options – no timber or timber-based products
The flooring options retained in the revised E3/AS1 Amendment 7 (which came into effect on 5 November 2020) include the obvious linings and finishes such as waterproof sheet material (for example, PVC) with sealed joints, ceramic tiles and sealed or polished concrete floors – but now only slab on grade.
The removal of previous option (f) – timber or timber-based products – covers a wide range of timber flooring types and is a little more contentious. One option that was previously included was ‘particleboard sheet sealed with a waterproof applied coating’, which is a fairly loose prescription. I can imagine the potential for poor performance from an inadequate interpretation of this ‘waterproof flooring system’.
However, other timber flooring options seem far more durable and robust and able to be installed to a suitable level of specification (impervious and easily cleaned) for use in areas exposed to watersplash.
Timber systems in wet areas
Not all timber overlay and clip-type systems are designed for use in these wet areas, but several are, and with suitable specific high-quality surface sealer coatings, they can remain durable and impervious.
Solid timber tongue and groove (T&G) floors, when installed correctly using suitable materials and sealer coatings, have traditionally performed well in domestic wet areas such as kitchens. The image on the right shows the dishwasher installed nearly 25 years ago in my own kitchen on a Mātai T&G floor.
The floor has survived a couple of small floods with no issues, but we did apply four coats of sports-floor polyurethane to the entire room – including under all kitchen joinery – and lapped up the wall junctions.
Our bathrooms upstairs, on identical polyurethane-coated Mātai floorboards, have also had no problems over 25 years, although they do have the safeguard of their original CP floor wastes installed during initial construction in 1936.
Our architectural practice regularly specifies new overlay and suspended timber T&G floors – often in new homes, but also to marry into existing, original native timber T&G floors. In service areas where they might get a splash of water, they are timeless and extremely durable when done well, but that does mean using the best materials and experienced professional installers.
Alternative Solution is a good option
On Thursday 4 November 2021, E3/AS1 switched to Amendment 7 only. If you want a particular wet area floor other than PVC, tiles or concrete, it will have to be designed and consented as an Alternative Solution as a means of compliance.
This is not difficult for robust systems and where the risk of failure is lower, such as standalone housing. Take as an example my wet area Mātai T&G floor. If we design and specify to best practice and can illustrate good history of use of that flooring system, it should be able to satisfy a building consent authority.
Think of an Alternative Solution as freeing you from the constraints of Acceptable Solutions. You are no longer limited to just three wet area flooring options – you have an infinite number to choose from.
Maybe you will struggle to smuggle a shagpile carpet in the bathroom through building consent. However, this shouldn’t deter you from presenting quality alternatives that you can justify as fit for purpose in your building consent applications.

Greater understanding of how to incorporate air seals in openings and penetrations in the exterior envelope of a building is necessary to prevent wind-driven water from entering
It has been more than 30 years since E2/AS1, the Acceptable Solution for proving compliance with Building Code clause E2 External Moisture, was introduced and widely adopted by the industry.
Increased understanding of weathertightness
E2/AS1 can be credited with bringing a new understanding of weathertight design and construction principles to the wider industry, resulting in more resilient and higher-performing residential dwellings. However, design and building practitioners frequently do not fully understand the rationale behind some of the requirements in critical performance areas.
One area of concern is incorporating air seals in openings and penetrations in a building’s exterior envelope. This article examines why air seals are necessary and the key aspects of their installation.
Air pressure
Even in situations with relatively low wind speed, wind acting on a building creates higher air pressure on the building’s external envelope compared to the pressure on the building’s interior.
If there are any gaps in the exterior envelope, no matter how small, this pressure differential can create an airflow or leakage path from the exterior of the building to the interior—moving from high to low pressure.
When rainwater is present on the building’s exterior, it can be driven by the pressure differential along any air leakage path, which then becomes a water leakage path.
Some water leakage paths may carry water into the exterior wall assembly, but gaps around windows, doors, and other openings—such as meter boxes—run continuously through the wall assembly from the exterior to the interior. This creates the potential for water to be driven into the interior. This risk also exists with pipe and service penetrations through the exterior envelope.
Pressure moderation
To negate this pressure-driving effect, it is necessary to moderate the air pressure within the trim cavity around exterior window and door joinery. This requires air seals to be installed in the trim cavity.
Installing an air seal at the interior face of the exterior wall framing allows higher-pressure air from the exterior to enter the trim cavity. However, at this point, it is blocked from entering the building’s interior by the air seal.
The air within the trim cavity then moderates to match the external air pressure, negating the pressure differential and eliminating the potential for water to enter the building’s interior through the trim cavity.
E2/AS1 air seals for exterior joinery and meter boxes
Air seals need to be installed around the entire trim cavity, sealing off the gap between the rough opening frame and the reveals of the exterior joinery.
For meter boxes, the seal must close the gap between the rough opening frame and the actual body of the meter box within the framing. The seal should be located on the internal line of the exterior framing. Seals must be formed with either a self-expanding polyurethane foam or a compliant sealant, which is installed over a polyethylene foam (PEF) backing rod.
The backing rod ensures that when the foam or sealant is installed, it does not migrate further into the trim cavity, where it could come into contact with water on the exterior face of the wall framing behind the cladding or window flange. This could cause the seal to deteriorate or allow water to wick into the building’s interior.
Both the seal and backing rod must be accurately installed to ensure continuity with no gaps. Even small gaps can create an air or water leakage path. Joinery packers need to be installed to allow a continuous run of air seal around the perimeter, with the backing rod running between any packers.
E2/AS1 air seals for pipe penetrations
Exterior pipe and service penetrations must be installed before the cladding. The penetration must be taped with flexible flashing tape around its circumference, sealing it to the flexible wall underlay or rigid air barrier on the outside face of the framing.
Air seals must be installed around all pipe and service penetrations, effectively sealing the gap between the penetration and the external cladding. The sealant used must be compliant and precisely applied. Following this, a flange plate is installed over the penetration and sealed to the outer face of the cladding.
Building envelope airtightness
Another benefit of air seals around openings in the exterior envelope is their contribution to the overall airtightness of the building. Although this may not have been a key consideration when E2/AS1 was introduced, sealing these air leakage paths significantly impacts the ability to manage the building’s internal temperature.
Eliminating air leakage through the exterior envelope also improves energy efficiency by preventing heat loss during colder months and heat gain in warmer months. This ensures that heating and cooling systems function more efficiently, maximizing the benefits of increased insulation.
The key to effective air seals in exterior penetrations lies in the accuracy of installation. There is evidence that, at times, seals are being poorly installed. The challenge is to understand the importance of these seals and ensure they are installed with the necessary precision.

Every industry has its own technical terms and jargon, and the concrete industry is no exception. To test your knowledge, we have pulled together some of the most commonly used and confused terms
A lthough concrete specialists are usually employed to place concrete, it’s worthwhile for builders to understand what the terms they use in conversation and on plans really mean.
These definitions are presented in lay terms; for a technically precise definition, refer to the American Concrete Institute’s ACI 116 – Cement and Concrete Terminology .
Admixture vs. Additive
An admixture is a material other than water, aggregate, cement or fibres that is added to batches of concrete.
Typical examples are air-entraining, water-reducing, accelerating or retarding admixtures.
The term additive is normally reserved for materials used by cement manufacturers to modify the properties of cement, such as limestone or gypsum.
Entrained air vs. Entrapped air
Entrained air is made up of microscopic air bubbles that are intentionally incorporated into the concrete, normally to improve its freeze/thaw resistance.
Entrapped air is made up of bubbles, of 1mm diameter or larger, which are accidentally incorporated into the concrete during the production process. They should be removed via consolidation.
The presence of air reduces the strength of concrete. However, because entrained air is deliberately incorporated into the mix, the designer will have compensated for its presence. This is not the case with entrapped air.
Consolidation vs. Vibration
Consolidation (or compaction) is the process of inducing a closer spacing arrangement between the solid particles when placing concrete. It can be achieved by various methods, including:
Vibration.
Rodding.
Tamping.
Centrifugation.
Therefore, vibration is just one method of consolidating concrete.
Floating vs. Trowelling
The purpose of floating a concrete surface is to create a relatively even, but open texture.
Floating:
Embeds large aggregates beneath the surface.
Removes slight imperfections to produce a surface closer to the true plane.
Compacts the surface.
Closes minor surface cracks that may appear as the surface dries.
A bull float is a large float on a long handle used prior to the appearance of the bleed water. Hand floats are typically made of wood or magnesium. They do not have sharp edges, because these would close the surface of the concrete.
Power floating occurs after the bleed water has evaporated from the surface. It’s carried out using blades with turned-up edges to prevent them closing the surface.
Trowelling occurs some time after floating and creates a hard, dense, closed finish to the concrete surface.
Steel blades are used for hand trowelling. The blades on a power trowelling machine are thinner than a float blade and have sharp edges to close the concrete surface.
Placing vs. Pouring
Placing involves the deposition, distribution and consolidation of concrete in the place where it’s supposed to harden. This process is often inappropriately referred to as pouring. However, pouring only refers to the deposition phase. Always refer to placing rather than pouring concrete.
Prestress vs. Post-tensioned vs. Pre-tensioned Concrete
Prestressed concrete is hardened concrete that is in a state of compression prior to the application of the service loads. Subsets of this generic term are post-tensioned and pre-tensioned concrete, which indicate how the compressive force is applied to the concrete.
With pre-tensioning, the tendons are tensioned before the concrete is placed and hardened.
An example of this would be most of the preparatory flooring systems, such as Hollowcore slabs.
In post-tensioning, ducts are typically provided in the concrete and the tendons are tensioned after the concrete has hardened, such as post-tensioned slabs-on-grade.
Concrete vs. Cement
It may appear obvious, but some confusion does exist. Cement is the fine, normally grey powder that, when mixed with water, reacts and in time goes hard.
Concrete is a mixture of cement, aggregates, water and admixtures, which typically comes out the back of a ready mix truck.
Reinforcing Grade vs. Class
Grade refers to the strength of the reinforcing bar, typically 300 or 500MPa.
Class refers to the ductility (‘stretchability’) of the bar. The only accepted bar in New Zealand is Class E (Earthquake).

Timber weatherboards have an excellent performance history. By using a good product and following basic handling, installation and finishing procedures, builders should ensure a quality job.
Timber weatherboards are enjoying a resurgence in the wake of the country’s leaky building problems. The most commonly used timber weatherboard today is finger-jointed, treated and primed New Zealand pine.
Check that timber weatherboards are well packaged – they should be well wrapped and strapped when leaving the manufacturer’s site. Wrapping should be a high-quality tear-resistant material, to provide adequate weather protection. Packets of weatherboards should have suitable bearers and strapping to withstand standard freight handling. Strapping should not bruise or mark the boards. The product should arrive at the site in perfect condition.
Cladding should be delivered to site ‘just in time’. Boards that arrive on site too far ahead of schedule are at increased risk of damage through additional handling and moisture exposure.
If mechanical equipment is not available to unload boards, do it by hand. They should never be tipped from the truck. Once the material is unloaded, it should be inspected and major damage reported to the merchant immediately.
Timber weatherboards are kiln-dried and the boards must be kept dry, as the priming does not weatherproof these products. Exposure to the elements increases the risk of board swelling, primer breakdown and tannin bleed. Boards should be stored indoors on a flat, well-ventilated surface, out of contact with the ground or concrete. Bearers should be placed evenly under the packet with a minimum of 150 mm clearance. A secondary cover and groundsheet should be used if boards are stored outdoors.
Timber weatherboards may be specified in buildings that fall within the scope of NZS 3604 Timber-framed buildings and E2/AS1 . Follow these specifications, as well as manufacturers’ individual weatherboard installation guidelines.
The following are some of the key points you should consider when installing the cladding:
Ensure minimum lap requirements are met. Note the current version of E2/AS1 requires a 32mm minimum gap for timber weatherboard.
Correct fastening is essential. Use the appropriate nail – both size and nail head configuration are important.
Hand nailing is recommended, as some gun fixings may bruise the surface of the board.
Only one nail should be used per board at each stud spacing. Do not double nail boards, as this will impede the boards’ natural movement and may cause splitting. Do not nail through the lap of the weatherboard.
Nails should be sloped slightly uphill to avoid water tracking along the length of the nail into the timber.
Nails should be punched beneath the surface of the board and filled immediately, to avoid water penetration that will result in board swelling.
At ground level, weatherboards should finish at least 100 mm above paved surfaces and 175 mm above unpaved surfaces.
Seal all cut ends/end grain immediately after cutting and before installation. For ease, use an aerosol end seal primer or two coats of premium oil-based timber primer.
Weatherboards should be fixed in full wall lengths where possible. Some manufacturers provide 7.2 m lengths to minimise joints.
Where a joint is necessary, it should be made over a stud or batten. Scarf the joint away from the prevailing wind at 45 degrees and use a single fixing through the overlapping board.
Prime cut ends and cover joint with a soaker if required.
Plain mitred external corners should be avoided.
The use of corrosion-resistant soakers is preferable.
When using boxed corners, use the appropriate scriber system.
Scribers should be precoated to ensure weather protection.
The use of a factory-cut preprimed scriber system is recommended for accuracy and ease of use.
Corrosion-resistant flashings should be fitted behind the weatherboards at all internal corners.
Junctions at the interface between the cladding system and window and door openings, for example, are vital for weathertightness. Setting window head heights to suit the board module makes window flashing and cladding installation much easier.
Ensure all flashings, weatherings and air seals are correctly in place.
The BRANZ Good Practice Guide – Timber Cladding is a practical hands-on guide to installation.
Weatherboards should be painted and finished in accordance with A S/NZS 2311:2009 Guide to the painting of buildings . Manufacturers’ painting instructions should also be carefully followed.
Weatherboards should only be painted when dry and the board is near equilibrium moisture content (MC<16%). If you’re unsure, use a correctly calibrated moisture meter to measure board moisture content.
Board size dimensions should also be checked. If the board is larger than its factory-machined dimensions, it has probably taken on moisture. It must be allowed to dry out or shrinkage lap marks between the boards may occur, affecting overall aesthetics.
Remove all loose material from the board surface and ensure any unfilled nail holes are filled.
Spot prime exposed, bare and damaged areas with premium oil-based timber primer.
Lightly sand the surface where necessary to an even flat finish.
If primer has been exposed to the weather for longer than six weeks, consult your weatherboard manufacturer for additional painting advice.
There are several other critical areas for painting:
Cut ends – all cut ends should have been sealed with an oil alkyd primer sealer during installation.
Priming – dual coat systems (pre-primed and undercoated) save painting time and labour, as well as offering better initial moisture protection. If weatherboards arenot dual coated, apply one full coat of primer as specified by the board manufacturer.
Final coats – two top coats of premium low gloss acrylic should be applied at a minimum of 25 dry microns per coat. Total film build, including primers, should exceed 100 dry microns.
Colour – dark colours absorb heat from the sun and increase the risk of board defects. For best performance, select colours in a range of 45% light reflective value (LRV) or greater.
A quality paint system should last in excess of ten years. Basic maintenance of a gentle annual wash of the exterior, especially under eaves and overhangs, will remove marine salts and other contaminants. When maintenance is required, use premium primer and undercoats followed by the original topcoat. Quality timber weatherboards, installed with care, and maintained effectively, should provide weathertight cladding for generations.

Where it’s possible to fall 1m or more from a deck, the building code requires a barrier that’s able to withstand all imposed, wind and impact loads. In this month’s issue of Under Construction, we look at some options.
In 2012, the Department of Building and Housing (now the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment) published Guidance on Barrier Design, which gives guidance and recommendations on designing and installing code-compliant barriers.
As of December 2012, a timber barrier complying with paragraph 4.2.7 of the Guidance on barrier design meets the Building Code clause F4 and B2 requirements. Other barriers will need specific engineering design.
Barriers for residential decks must:
Be continuous where the fall height is over 1 m.
Be at least 1 m high.
Have openings that prevent a 100 mm diameter sphere passing through.
Have less than 15 mm gaps between horizontal rails.
Have the top of the barrier at least 760 mm above a fixed seat.
Have no sharp edges or projections.
The components of a barrier are shown in Figure 1. Generally, barrier structural components must have not less than 50-year durability, while other components may have not less than 15-year durability (see Figure 2).
However, if barriers and fixings can be accessed and replaced without difficulty and any failure detected, then the durability may be not less than 15 years. Likewise, baluster infill components that are difficult to access may require 50-year durability.
Barriers must be designed to withstand live (imposed) loads, wind loads and deflection limits from AS/NZS 1170 Structural design actions .
Live (imposed) and wind loads:
AS/NZS 1170.1 paragraph 3.6 and Table 3.3 and modifications in B1/VM1 paragraph 2.2.7 set out requirements for barrier members and connections for residential decks. The loadings described in AS/NZS 1170.1 Table 3.3 include line (top edge), infill (distributed) and concentrated loads.
AS/NZS 1170.2 sets out the wind loads that barriers must be designed to resist.
Deflection limits:
It is recommended that deflection limits do not exceed 30 mm under wind and barrier loads, as described in B1/VM1.
Barrier materials for timber decks include:
Timber.
Glass.
Metals – aluminium, mild steel and stainless steel.
Select timber species and grades for residential deck barriers in accordance with NZS 3603 Timber structures standard. The timber grade must be at least SG8 (wet in service), except infill members, which may be SG6 (wet in service).
For durability and treatment, see NZS 3602 Timber and wood-based products for use in building . Pinus radiata must be treated to H3.2. Select metal fixings in accordance with NZS 3604:2011 section 4.4 to have the same durability as the components they connect.
The supporting structure – edge, boundary and deck joists – must be in accordance with NZS 3604 section 7.4 (see Figure 3) and the Adjustments to the deck details in NZS 3604 described in Codewords 54, published December 2012 by MBIE.
Guidance on barrier design includes recommended sizes for timber components (see Figure 2 and Table 1).
Glass for structural barriers must be Grade A toughened safety glass, complying with NZS 4223.3:1999 Glazing in buildings Part 3: Appendix 3A. Infill glass can also be Grade A laminated.
There are a variety of support systems for structural glass barriers (see Figure 4) and glass infill barriers (see Figure 5).
Guidance on barrier design includes tables from the Glass Association of New Zealand for both structural and infill glass design.
Aluminium barriers must be designed in accordance with AS/NZS 1664.1 Aluminium structures or tested to comply with AS/NZS 1170.0 Appendix B.
Aluminium can have either an anodised or a powder-coated finish. Anodising involves treatment to provide an oxide film over the surface. For an anodised finish, Guidance on barrier design recommends anodising thicknesses of:
12 microns for sheltered, non-coastal regions.
20 microns for exposed, inland regions (minimum thickness recommended for balustrades and barriers).
24 microns for coastal and geothermal regions.
Powder-coated finishes are heat-applied, electrostatically charged paint pigments that fuse to the metal to give a durable and corrosion-resistant coating.
Steel barriers must be in accordance with AS/NZS 3404 Steel structures standard or tested to comply with AS/NZS 1170.0 Appendix B.
Mild steel has poor corrosion resistance and requires an applied corrosion protection – guidance is given in NZS 3404.1:2009 Section 5.
Stainless steel barriers must be either grade 304, for use in non-corrosive environments, or grade 316 for use in corrosive environments.
Finishes include:
Mill finish – satin.
Brushed finish – directional grain finish.
Bright finish – mirror or polished.
Wire infill for barriers
Wire mesh or rope is frequently used for the baluster infill, as it doesn’t restrict the view. Wire infills are usually fixed to a stainless steel structure (main posts and rails), although aluminium or stainless steel may also be used. Timber is not recommended, as it’s likely to creep, causing wires to loosen off.
Wires should be multi-stranded grade 316 stainless steel in all situations, although grade 304 is allowed in sheltered situations. They may be arranged vertically or sloped (see Figure 6) and must be evenly tensioned (typically to 1.1 kN), so they cannot be forced apart beyond the maximum 100 mm spacing.
If bending around tight corners, use 7 × 7 or 7 × 19 wire rope, with a maximum diameter of 2.5 mm. Where straight runs only are used, the wire may be 1 × 19 and the diameter greater – it’s stronger, stiffer and requires less tensioning.
When a change of direction occurs in a balustrade, the wire run is usually terminated, anchored to the strainer post, then a new cable run started.Fixing and tensioning should be done using turnbuckles with locknuts on to ensure the turnbuckles don’t unwind. The fittings used should be the same grade of stainless steel as the wires.

Structural insulated panels are relatively new to Aotearoa New Zealand residential buildings, but they have benefits in thermal performance and construction speed that are making them increasingly popular
S tructural insulated panels (SIPs) themselves are not a new arrival. Think of a commercial cold store and steel-skinned panels with an insulating core probably come to mind. Those are SIPs, and that type has been around for decades. What is new is the expanding variety of skins and cores now available and the growing use of SIPs in home building.
What SIPs comprise
The SIPs used in homes are lightweight sandwich panels, typically made up of two high-density face layers bonded to a low-density cellular core. The face layers are usually:
Engineered wood panels – oriented strand board is common.
Cement board – including magnesium oxide (MgO) board made with an MgO cement, lightweight filler materials and glass fibre mesh reinforcing.
Metal – lightweight steel or aluminium, which may be corrugated for strength and stiffness.
The core provides insulation and structural support by distributing load between the face layers. Common core materials include:
Expanded polystyrene (EPS).
Extruded polystyrene (XPS).
Polyurethane (PUR).
Polyisocyanurate (PIR).
The core may be bonded with adhesive to face layers – the usual process for polystyrene – or may self-adhere if it is injected between face panels as a liquid, which is most common with PUR or PIR.
SIPs are manufactured here, imported from overseas or assembled here using overseas and/or local components. They are often proprietary products with their own design guides, engineering calculations and recommended construction methods.
Advantages and disadvantages
Construction with SIPs produces a high level of airtightness and higher thermal performance than can be achieved with 90mm timber-framed exterior walls (see the section on H1 below). Where SIPs are made into wall, floor, ceiling or roof sections off site and craned into place on site, construction can be faster than conventional materials and methods.
The main disadvantage is that SIPs often cost more than conventional building materials. This may be offset by lower labour costs if sitework
takes less time and lower operating costs where the SIPs have high thermal performance.
Building with SIPs
SIPs are available as panels 1.2m wide and 2.4m, 2.7m, 3m or 3.3m long (longer by special order). Panel thickness varies depending on the face layers and core, but panels around 100–120mm thick are common and up to 300mm or more is possible. Weight varies between products. One manufacturer indicates 20 kg/m². Another indicates 75kg for a 2.4 x 1.2m panel with engineered timber face layers.
SIPs can be used for structural and non-structural components. They can be supplied on pallets and installed one panel at a time on site or be prefabricated off site into wall, roof and floor sections with window and door openings cut out.
Panels with timber-based faces can be connected with timber or LVL splines (rectangular elements that fit into a groove), a foam block or mini-SIP splines and OSB splines (see Figure 1).
There are often solid timber or LVL members running along the top and bottom – the top and bottom plates (Figure 2 overleaf). These plates allow SIP walls to be connected to the roof, ceiling or floor systems, which may or may not be a SIP themselves. The bottom plate can be used as the connection between wall panels and the foundation.
Embedded framing that includes lintels is used as supports for loadbearing elements, including at window and door openings.
Cladding and lining
Some manufacturers recommend a cavity batten system for claddings. Some also recommend battens on the internal walls, providing a cavity for electrical wiring behind the plasterboard lining. With others, the face layer can be used as the interior wall surface, either left exposed, painted or plaster skimmed and painted.
Wiring and plumbing
While some SIP systems run cables (or conduits) through a cavity between the SIP and the interior lining, others have chases precut in the core. With EPS cores, conduit or sheathing is required to prevent contact between cables and polystyrene.
Some manufacturers cut plumbing chases through the core, but many recommend that plumbing pipes are not run through the core.
Building Code compliance
SIPS are not currently included in Acceptable Solutions or Verification Methods, so Building Code compliance must use an Alternative Solution. For clauses such as B1, this requires an engineering assessment. Many SIP suppliers provide engineering calculations – project-specific engineering assessment is not required where products are used within scope.
Some SIP products have CodeMark or BRANZ Appraisal certificates.
B1 Structure and B2 Durability
The structural performance of SIP systems – the interaction between the outer skins and perimeter timber framing members – is similar to a timber-framed wall with plywood cladding. Local designers of SIP houses sometimes use NZS 3604:2011 Timber-framed buildings . Bracing ratings for wall systems used with NZS 3604:2011 can only be determined following the P21 test method.
BRANZ has tested the seismic performance of SIPs, funded by EQC and the Building Research Levy. Tested systems showed suitable energy dissipation, ductility, strength and stiffness for prescriptive and specific engineered wall bracing designs. Damage during cyclic
loading was less for the SIPs than most of the more commonly used bracing systems.
Under clause B2, SIP wall, roof or floor sections must have a minimum durability of 50 years.
C Protection from fire
In all current fire compliance documents, there are specific reaction-to-fire requirements for building systems that include foamed plastic or combustible insulation. All SIPs that include these products are subject to these requirements.
Acceptable Solution C/AS1 can be applied to low-rise stand-alone or multi-unit dwellings, where each unit is independent of all other units (classified as risk group SH). C/AS1 requires that wall systems that include foamed plastics or combustible insulation (which would apply to SIPs with a foamed plastic core) must achieve a Group Number of not more than 3. There are no other surface lining requirements in C/AS1 for the SH risk group. SIPs used in locations requiring a fire separation (such as inter-tenancy walls) or for external walls close to a boundary may also require a 30-minute fire resistance rating in SH buildings.
In dwellings in New Zealand, plasterboard encapsulation is often used as a means of achieving adequate fire resistance.
H1 Energy efficiency
The thermal performance of SIPs depends on component material and thickness. Manufacturers claim R-values of around R2.3 – R2.8 for 100–115mm thick panels with a standard EPS core to as much as R9.0 for panels over 300mm wide with EPS that includes graphite.
The airtightness of 888 SIP buildings means that SIP manufacturers often recommend mechanical ventilation such as heat recovery ventilation.

If the top of a concrete slab-on-ground floor is not high enough above the surrounding ground, there can be problems. The lack of clearance can increase the risk of water getting into a building and shorten the life of building materials. Here’s a quick run-down on the clearances required for concrete slabs
Houses with slab-on-ground floors that have inadequate ground clearance can face specific problems:
Drainage slots for brick veneer wall claddings can get blocked or may even be sitting below ground level. Where this leads to water buildup, the result can be rot in timber framing and mould inside the wall and on interior surfaces.
Drainage slots at the sill for low or floor-level aluminium joinery can get blocked by paving or soil. This can lead to water damage inside the house.
Paving or concrete paths around the house that sit at the same level or higher than the floor increase the risk of water entering the house.
Blocked or restricted drainage/ventilation for nominal 20mm cavities behind lightweight claddings can lead to water damage.
Water splash from the adjacent ground onto the base of the claddings can results in a dirty finish and shorter material lifespan.
The key ground clearance requirements for slab floors are found in Acceptable Solutions E1/AS1 and E2/AS1 and NZS3604:2011 Timber-framed buildings .
E1/AS1 says that the floor level should be at least 150mm above the finished level of the ground around the building. It gives two other requirements:
Where the site is level with or above the road, the floor level must be at least 150mm above the crown of the road (on at least one cross-section through the site).
Where the site is below the road, the floor level must be at least 150mm above the lowest point on the site boundary.
(E1/AS1 only applies to sites up to 2,500m2 that are not low-lying, flood-prone, beside a watercourse or located where storm water would flow if drainage systems became overloaded. Buildings in these areas require specific design.)
Figures 1 and 2 adapted from Acceptable Solution E2/AS1 show the minimum clearance set out in that document. E2/AS1 requirements for slab floors and brick veneer cladding (Figure 1) are:
Floor levels that are:
i) 100mm minimum above paving.
ii) 150mm minimum above unpaved ground.
Rebate level to floor level of 50mm minimum.
Rebate level 25mm minimum above paved ground.
Rebate level 100mm minimum above unpaved ground.
The E2/AS1 requirements for houses with slab floors and other cladding types (Figure 2) are floor levels that are:
150mm minimum above paving.
225mm minimum above unpaved ground.
When planning slab floors, take account of the intended finished landscaping around the house to avoid the minimum clearances not being met.

The building control system has many documents, so it can be hard to know where to find information. This new series starts by explaining the hierarchy of the key documents and the importance of keeping them updated
The hierarchy of documents for New Zealand building controls is:
Building Act 2004 and subsequent amendments (the latest being 2013).
New Zealand Building Code (produced under the Building Regulations).
Acceptable Solutions and Verification Methods, which may cite appropriate standards (national and international) as a means of compliance.
A good resource that explains the New Zealand Building Control system (NZBC) is BRANZ’s Building Basics: Building Controls .
The Building Act provides the framework for the NZBC. For details, see www.dbh.govt.nz/ba-about-the-building-act.
These contain the rules for building consent authorities, LBPs, prescribed forms and applicable penalties. They also list specified systems, define ‘change of use’ and ‘moderate earthquake’, and set out the rate of any levies and fees for determinations.
Regulations related to Building Code clauses were initiated by the Building Regulations 1992. This has been since revoked, except for Regulation 3 and Schedule 1:
Regulation 3 covers the performance criteria specified in the Building Code for the classified use of that building.
Schedule 1 of the Building Regulations 1992 covers building uses, interpretation and importance levels and then covers objectives, and functional and performance requirements.
For more on the Building Regulations, see page 6 of the New Zealand Building Code Handbook , available at www.dbh.govt.nz/compliance-documents#handbooks .
The performance-based NZBC has 37 clauses and three preliminary clauses. These set out the functional requirements and performance criteria that the Building Act requires all buildings to meet. They do not prescribe how the work should be done.
To comply with the Building Code, building work has to satisfy the requirements set out in each clause. Building Code clauses offer a Verification Method and/or an Acceptable Solution; most have both.
Pathways to compliance in line with the Building Code include:
Verification Methods.
Acceptable Solutions.
Determinations.
Product certification (where the product use is within the scope of the product certification).
The current scheme is known as CodeMark .
Sometimes a different building solution is needed. Any detail or method outside the Acceptable Solutions or Verification Methods needs to be consented as Alternative Solutions.
Alternative solutions must be presented to the BCA with supporting evidence. Once consented, it becomes an Alternative Solution. Supporting evidence may be:
A satisfactory history of use in a comparable situation.
A comparison to an acceptable solution.
A previously accepted comparable alternative solution.
Independently assessed performance, such as a BRANZ appraisal.
The subject of an expert opinion.
Favourable test results relevant to the proposed use.
A good resource that explains all of this is BRANZ’s Building Basics – Building Code Compliance .
“Alternative solutions must be presented to the BCA with supporting evidence
All 37 Building Code clauses are available free from www.dbh.govt.nz/compliance-documents . It’s good to practice to check you are using the latest version.
Each Building Code clause has a similar structure. As an example, let’s look at Building Code clause B1 Structure that covers Acceptable Solutions and Verification Methods for B1 Structure . In order, it contains:
Document status with the history of all document alterations.
Relevant extracts from the first schedule of the building regulations 1992 with: –  objectives –  functional requirements –  performance requirements
Contents.
References indicating the versions of standards and other documents that apply to the Acceptable Solutions, Verification Methods, and where in the building code clause they are quoted.
Definitions.
Verification Methods that provide a means for the design of structures to meet the performance requirements of the Building Code – for example, B1/VM1 covers verification methods for general construction, referencing relevant standards.
Acceptable solutions that provide either a specific deemed-to-comply solution or references standards that, if used as required, will meet the performance requirements of the building code – for example, B1/AS3 includes specific solutions for small chimneys.
Cited standards can be modified by clauses within Acceptable Solutions and Verification Methods.
It’s always a good idea to check the relevant Code clauses to see if they are modifying the referenced standard, or have referenced a later version of the standard.
For example, B1/AS1 references NZS 3604:2011 as an Acceptable Solution for timber-framed buildings, but B1/AS1 page 23A, clause 3.1, says: ‘ NZS 3604 subject to the following modifications’. The listed modifications need to be made to use the standard.
Standards modified by B1 Amendment 12 in February 2014 were AS/NZS 1170, NZS 4211, NZS 4223, NZS 4229 and AS/NZS 4600 .
Standards modified by B1 Amendment 11 in August 2011 were AS/NZS 1170, AS/NZS 1664.1, NZS 4211, NZS 4219, NZS 4229, NZS 3603, NZS 3604, NZS 4229, NZS 4223, NZS 4297 and AS/NZS 4600 .
When a standard is updated by its publishers, the new version is not automatically a means of compliance. It must be referenced anew by MBIE in the Building Code clause.
“To comply with the Building Code, building work has to satisfy the requirements set out in each clause. Building Code clauses offer a Verification Method and/or an Acceptable Solution; most have both
A good method to keep your standards up to date is to look at the relevant Acceptable Solutions and Verification Method clauses, for example, B1/AS1 Structure when using NZS 3604:2011 .
Check if amendments have been made to the standard, or if a later version is referenced. Print any amendments to the standard and cut and paste over the original clauses to avoid confusion.
The side columns in the Building Code clauses always have the amendment number and date modified, so the most recent changes can be tracked.
If a later version of the standard has been referenced without amendment, use the later version of the standard.

Proper on-site management of the wall cladding is critical to delivering quality buildings.  This article is part one of a two-part series looking at the storage requirements for  different types of wall claddings
Wall claddings are what we see when we approach a building, and any defects from poor handling, storage or installation may be visible. They can also affect the durability of the cladding.
Challenges with storage and handling
Looking after wall claddings during delivery, storage and installation means:
Planning for deliveries.
Providing access for delivery vehicles.
Designating an appropriate storage area where cladding can be stored: Wall claddings need to be kept protected and dry before installation. Bricks and concrete blocks can be stored on their delivery pallets outside
Wall claddings need to be kept protected and dry before installation.
Bricks and concrete blocks can be stored on their delivery pallets outside
Planning for handling, such as lifting and carrying for upper-floor claddings.
Employing the correct manual handling techniques to distribute materials around the site to their installed location.
Additional challenges when storing and handling cladding materials include:
Accommodating long lengths – for example, up to 8m long uPVC weatherboards or 12m long profiled metal and flashings.
Carrying long and relatively floppy sheet materials – additional labour may be required.
Wind loads on sheet materials stored outside.
Prefinished materials.
Bricks, concrete blocks and stone
Leave these shrink-wrapped on the pallet until required. Pallets should be lifted onto a flat surface clear of buildings and fences to allow adequate air circulation and give easy access for handling.
They should be hoisted or transported using a pallet jack. Avoid carrying bricks and blocks in a wheelbarrow unless absolutely required.
Fibre-cement sheets and weatherboard
Fibre-cement sheets, weatherboards, planks and trims must be stored laid flat on a smooth level surface with edges protected from chipping.
Timber weatherboards supplied without a primer or sealer coat that will be painted should be coated immediately in dry conditions. This is to seal and minimise the risk of unacceptable water absorption before the product is installed.
Primers used to factory pre-prime  timber in New Zealand are typically thin-holding primers designed to provide temporary protection during  the building process. The timber must be sanded and primed with a primer.
Sheets and weatherboards should be carried in the vertical position, not flat, to avoid excessive bending.
To ensure optimum performance, store under cover and keep dry prior to fixing. If they become wet, allow to dry thoroughly before fixing. Sheets stored outside are susceptible to wind damage unless securely tied down.
Sheets and weatherboards that will be painted, but are supplied without a primer or sealer coat, should be coated immediately to seal and minimise the risk of unacceptable water absorption before the product is installed.
Primer applied to weatherboards or sheets should not be exposed to the weather for more than 30 to 45 days, depending on the primer. Ideally, the next coat of paint should be applied as quickly as practicable.
Timber weatherboards
Timber weatherboards must be stored laid flat on a smooth level dry surface, clear of concrete slab or timber floors. Store under cover, and on slats to allow air movement. Keep dry prior to fixing. If they become wet, allow to dry thoroughly before fixing.
Timber weatherboards should only be painted when dry and the board is near equilibrium moisture content (MC<16%). H3.1 treated weatherboards and trim require all surfaces to be painted before installation including all holes and notches.
Similar handling and storage practices to those above (for timber weatherboards) can be applied to:
Timber boards and battens.
Plywood weatherboards.
Reconstituted wood weatherboards.
UPVC weatherboards
uPVC weatherboards are delivered plastic wrapped and must be:
Stored in dry undercover conditions if they are not going to be installed within a few days.
Stacked flat, clear of the ground with no other materials on top of the planks.
Supported on bearers at 600mm maximum centres.
Restrained from collapse.
Carried on edge, taking care to avoid damage to the plank edges, ends and the weather surface.
Plywood
Flat sheet plywood cladding and rigid air barriers may be treated or untreated.
Untreated plywood is generally dispatched with a moisture content of 8–15%. It will respond to changes in ambient humidity so the eventual moisture content will depend on the environmental conditions. The veneers swell or shrink across the grain in response.
CCA-treated plywood is dried following treatment to an average moisture content of approximately 18%. When handling, carry sheets on edge and locate storage so that sheets will not be exposed to mechanical damage.
When storing plywood, keep dry and protected from sun, rain and wind as rapid changes in temperature and humidity can cause staining, fading and surface checking. Keep the stack clear of the ground in a well-ventilated area. The H3.1 LOSP solvent smell can be quite strong, and venting is recommended until most of the solvent has evaporated.
Stack sheets flat. Support the sheets at both ends and the middle to avoid distortion – align bearers in packs over bearers in packs below. Do not store other materials on the plywood or use it as a platform or table. Secure sheets stored outside against wind uplift.
Fillets used to separate sheets in drying may leave marks on the sheet surface, but these will fade. They can be disguised with paint but may be visible under stain.
Once installed, ensure plywood cladding is below 18% moisture content before installing moisture-sensitive materials, coverings, coatings or adhesives.
Untreated plywood will withstand rain wetting and exposure during construction for up to three months. In high temperatures and high rainfall, this period may be less. Discolouration and face checking of the sheet surface can be expected when exposed for longer periods.
Where the moisture content exceeds 18% for prolonged periods, plywood must be H3.1 LOSP or H3.2 CCAtreated to resist decay or insects.
When coating H3.1 LOSP-treated plywood, there may be traces of residual solvent on the sheet surface from the treatment process. Sheets that are greasy to touch should be placed in a well-ventilated area and allowed to flash off to ensure proper adhesion of paints and stains to the sheet surface.

The basic function of residential pavements, such as driveways, paths and patios, is to provide safe and easy access onto or around a property. Concrete is typically used to not only provide a durable paving surface (sloped, to provide surface water run-off) but one which can also incorporate a wide range of decorative finishes to complement the design and landscaping of the residence.
While creating a concrete pavement is relatively straightforward, there are a number of design and construction aspects that need to be considered in order to produce a finished product that satisfies the functional and aesthetic requirements of the homeowners.
Water should not be added to the ready-mix truck on site without good reason. When water is added to concrete over and above that specified by the concrete plant, the strength and surface resistance will be reduced and shrinkage increased. However, where the slump in the truck on site is too low (water may have evaporated from the truck in hot weather) NZS 3104 allows water to be added in a controlled manner to increase the slump back to the specified value. In no circumstances shall the added water exceed 10 litres per cubic metre of concrete. This is preferable to placing concrete for which the slump is too low, resulting in lack of compaction of the pavement.
Any water ponding on the ground should be removed prior to placing the concrete, to avoid problems with water mixing with the concrete and segregation and washing out of cement paste from the aggregate. These can affect the strength and durability of the concrete.
Concrete placement should commence from one corner of the pavement and proceed continuously out from that point, with new concrete always being deposited onto the face of the concrete already placed to ensure interblending and avoid segregation – ie, the separation of the aggregate from the cement paste within a concrete mix, which may lead to honeycombing in the hardened concrete.
When placing concrete the following should be considered:
Transport. Often concrete is moved from the concrete truck to its final location by a pump. If a wheelbarrow is used, a typical placing rate of about 1 to 1.5 m3/h can be achieved when the travel distance is limited to about 50 m and a relatively level, smooth access is available to avoid jolting and possible segregation of the concrete. For driveways on a slope, concrete placement should commence at the lowest point.
Segregation. Segregation should be avoided by placing concrete as near as possible to its final location. Concrete should not be made to flow into its final position through the use of vibrators, or be dropped from heights of more than 2 m.
Adequate compaction significantly reduces porosity, increases strength, enhances abrasion resistance and general durability, and minimises the risk of cracking.
While any deeper sections of the pavement – such as edge thickenings and downturns – should be compacted using an immersion vibrator, for slabs on ground that are 100 mm or less in thickness, adequate compaction can usually be achieved through the placing, screeding and finishing processes. Sometimes, surface vibration will be used in the form of a small hand-held vibrating screed.
Immersion vibrators are not recommended for 100 mm thick slab-on-ground construction, as the slab depth does not allow proper immersion of the vibrator head and the plastic sheeting under the slab (if present) may be damaged.
After the concrete is placed and compacted, leave the surface until the bleed water has stopped coming to the surface – ie, the surface appears dry. At this stage, work the surface smooth with a ball float or magnesium float. Some finish types – eg, course broom – can be applied directly after this compaction and leveling stage.
Generally power floating and power trowelling are not used on pavements.
In hot or windy weather, care needs to be taken to prevent premature drying of the surface.
Slip and skid resistant concrete surfaces can be achieved by the appropriate texturing during finishing. The term ‘slip’ refers to pedestrian traffic, while ‘skid’ is the term used for vehicular traffic. Suitable slip finishes are listed in NZBC Acceptable Solution D1/AS1 Table 2.
Broomed finishes can produce a greater degree of skid resistance, suitable for vehicular traffic. For greater skid resistance on ramps, a steel-tyned comb can be used to groove the concrete surface. Compacting the surface of the concrete by trowelling will improve the strength and abrasion resistance, thereby assisting to maintain the slip resistant properties of the surface.
It is important that, where possible, the surface be trowelled either prior to the finish being applied (broom finish) or during the process of applying the finish (colour surface toppings).
Given the range of decorative products, finishes and finishing techniques available, the suitability of the finish for the intended purpose should be confirmed with either the manufacturer or applicator.
“Slip and skid resistant concrete surfaces can be achieved by the appropriate texturing during finishing. The term ‘slip’ refers to pedestrian traffic, while ‘skid’ is the term used for vehicular traffic
Where a surface sealer that may affect the texture is applied, care should be taken to ensure the finished surface provides the necessary slip and skid resistance. Incorporating silica dust or carborundum dust in an applied sealer is another technique to either maintain or improve the slip/skid resistance.
Two types of decorative finish frequently used for driveways are exposed aggregate or a ‘stamped’ finish. These finishes require specialist skill. More detail on these types of finishes can be found in the CCAA publication Exposed-aggregate finishes for flatwork – www.concrete.net.au/publications .

While NZS 3604:2011 Timber-framed buildings provides the know-how for most fixing jobs, there are some gaps when it comes to certain tasks builders may face. One of those is fixings for veranda rafter, which span between a ribbon plate attached to the building wall and a veranda beam
The same fixings as used for ordinary rafters can’t be used in this situation. This is due to wind uplift load under verandas, as well as uplift forces acting on the top surface of the veranda roof, especially where rafters overhang the beam.
Table 10.1 from NZS 3604:2011 can be used as a starting point, with a few tweaks in some cases.
Where the veranda rafter spacing is less than 1200mm, no adjustment is required; where it is 1200mm or more, use type F fixings to the veranda beam. An alternative fixing with a capacity of 7.0kN would also be suitable.
Rafter fixings to a ribbon plate can be the same as those in Table 10.1.
The ribbon plate should be the same size as the rafter and fixed to each stud with 2/14-gauge screws. Screw length should be enough to pass through the ribbon plate and cladding and penetrate at least 45mm into the stud.

Building code acceptable solution E2/AS1 does not have a detail how to construct the base of a cavity for timber or concrete piles, so where do we start?
Firstly, two aspects need to be considered:
The clearance distance between the bottom of the cladding and the finished ground level.
What is required to ensure the base of the cavity is not open to the subfloor.
Although both issues are addressed in E2/AS1 , different sections need to be applied when the foundation system is timber or concrete piles.
E2/AS1 provides minimum clearance distances between the bottom of the external cladding and ground level (paragraph 9.1.3, Figure 65 and Table 18). Table 18 gives minimum clearance distances depending on floor type – either concrete or timber. Paragraph 9.1.3.5 refers specifically to suspended timber floors and stipulates that the base of the cladding must overlap the timber floor structure by at least 50mm. This is also included in Table 18, note (2). See Table 1 for a summary.
Paragraph 9.1.3.5 also states that care must be taken to prevent air from the subfloor space, where moisture levels may be high, entering the drained cavity.
E2/AS1 paragraphs 9.1.8.2 and 9.1.8.3 cover cavity closer requirements. Paragraph 9.1.8.2 states that there should be no air movement between the drained cavity and a subfloor space, but also that the bottom of the cavity should be drained and vermin-proofed.
Paragraph 9.1.8.3 describes requirements for vermin-proofing, including that cavity closers should:
Have 3–5mm drainage slots
Provide a total opening area of 1,000mm 2 lineal metre of wall
Be located so that there is a drip edge of at least 10mm at the base of the cladding.
Figure 1 shows how both these requirements can be met with timber pile construction.
The subfloor space in fully piled foundations must have 3,500-mm 2 ventilation per square metre of floor space, to prevent subfloor dampness.
NZS 3604:2011 section 6.14 gives methods of providing ventilation including:
For sheet material – provide ventilation openings at no more than 750mm from each corner in both directions evenly distributed at not more than 1.8m spacing for the perimeter of the foundation.
For baseboards – provide continuous 20mm slots between baseboards.

The meanings of characteristic strength, capacity, ultimate load and serviceability load are not always well understood – here we hope to clear up any confusion
A building’s structure is there for only one purpose – to resist the applied loads with a reasonable margin. The structural designer’s role is to size members and design connections, so that the strength of the structure is greater than the applied loads (see Figure 1 above).
Loads could be gravity effects (often called imposed loads), wind or earthquake action, among others. Strength is the resistance of the structural members to the loads. NZS 3604:2011 Timber-framed buildings refers to bracing loads on the building as demand, and to the bracing or fixing strength as capacity. So in the NZS 3604:2011 context, it’s merely a case of ensuring that the capacity of the fixing – nail, strap, bracket or bracing element – is greater than the demand (see Table 1 below).
However, in the specific engineering design (SED) context, slightly different terminology is needed to cope with a couple of problems:
Load – we don’t know with certainty how many people will congregate on the floor, or how hard the wind will blow, or how big the earthquake will be over the life of the building.
Strength – because of material and workmanship variability, we can’t predict exactly how strong a structural member or joint will be.
To make a level playing field for designers and to reduce this uncertainty, the New Zealand Building Code lays down the ground rules in clause B1 Structure, and the various New Zealand standards fill in the details (see Table 1 below).
“Based on lots of statistical studies over many years, it is well established that over the life of the structure, smaller loads occur more frequently than larger ones
Based on lots of statistical studies over many years, it is well established that over the life of the structure, smaller loads occur more frequently than larger ones. The Building Code and standards around the world deal with this by requiring structural designers to consider two limit states:
Ultimate limit state (ULS) – the structure must resist a relatively rare load without failure (it may be damaged but should not collapse). For wind and earthquakes on typical buildings, that rare load is the one expected to occur on average only once in 500 years.
Serviceability limit state (SLS) – the structure must resist a more frequently occurring load without deforming or deflecting to an extent that may affect its serviceability or amenity.
The strength of a structure is normally verified by either design calculations or testing. Verification by design is based on material strengths set by the relevant material standards (concrete, timber and steel), and engineering calculation. This process gives the nominal strength of the structure.
Verification by testing involves testing a number of replicate members or components to failure. Because of the variability mentioned already, there will be a range of results that looks something like Figure 2; the problem then is to choose a suitable representative strength value.
The characteristic strength for structural design is set at the value that 95% of the test results will exceed (see Figure 2). To allow for site effects such as workmanship, the nominal or characteristic strength is multiplied by a reduction factor set by the material standard to give the design strength. This design strength is then balanced against the applied loads (see Figure 1). So, if you have a component whose strength is given as characteristic strength, the manufacturer or supplier needs to advise what its capacity is. Guidance on this is given in NZS 3604:2011 clause 2.4.7.

With decades of research into thermal insulation, structural strength, internal moisture and related topics, BRANZ is well placed to give practical advice about some recent questions we’ve heard around H1 compliance
T here is nothing revolutionary in the building materials and techniques required to comply with the new Acceptable Solutions and Verification Methods for Building Code clause H1 Energy efficiency. Houses have been designed, consented and constructed this way in Aotearoa New Zealand for years. What is different is that the materials and techniques are being brought fully into mainstream construction.
Key principles to follow
This means that more than a few people will be doing things they haven’t done before. For any given project, following a few key principles will help:
Choose the most appropriate compliance option for that project. Where using the schedule method seems fraught with difficulty, the calculation or modelling methods offer greater flexibility.
Choose the right roof and wall framing options.
Choose the right building materials or elements.
Know where to find key information such as construction R-values.
Know what’s not in the new H1 documents that you need to be aware of.
Choose the right compliance pathway
The schedule method in H1/AS1 has been very widely used in the past, but under the new requirements, the calculation or modelling methods may be a more practical way to meet the needs of a particular project. In some cases, you may be able to choose between several compliance pathways.
With roofs, for example, using the schedule method of compliance, all roofs require a construction R-value of R6.6. If this is a challenge, say for a particular skillion roof, the calculation or modelling method could be used. These allow – with some limits – a lower R-value in the roof if the R-values of other building elements are increased to compensate.
Mixed use buildings over 300m2 that include housing and non-housing classified uses such as those with commercial spaces on the ground floor and residential above – multiple classified uses – may be consented using multiple pathways. The commercial space on the ground floor may be designed according to H1/AS2 or H1/VM2 , and residential floors above may be designed according to H1/AS1 or H1/VM1 .
Another interesting mixed-use situation is buildings that include industrial and non-industrial uses such as commercial. Here, only the non-industrial part of the building needs to meet the H1 Energy efficiency requirements. However, the total size of the building – the area of occupied space including the industrial part – determines whether to use H1/AS1 (VM1) or H1/AS2 (VM2) . For example, for a large industrial warehouse with a small office, the small office would not be able to use H1/AS1 or H1/VM1 as the total area of occupied space of the entire building is over 300m2.
Choose the right framing options
90 x 45mm timber wall framing has been very widely used in New Zealand for a long time, and the new H1 allows this to continue as long as the framing ratio is less than 25%. But moving to 140mm wall framing allows space for a conventional insulation product of R4.0 rather than the R2.8, which is the maximum in 90mm walls. (With an R4.0 insulation product and 25% framing ratio, the construction R-value of the wall is R2.89.)
Using timber battens to frame a cavity for a secondary insulation layer to the internal face of the main wall framing is becoming more common. The 45 x 45mm – or similar – timber battens are spaced to suit the installation of insulation and mounting the interior lining. It is crucial to ensure that the interior wall lining is airtight to reduce the risk of moisture transfer. Wall bracing will need to be considered with this option. A secondary insulation layer can almost double wall construction R-value in some circumstances. (The BRANZ House insulation guide 6th edition has examples.)
A secondary layer of insulation is also a possibility with roofs.
Another way to achieve high insulation performance in a roof is using a raised heel (see Figure 1). This is a timber post incorporated at the outer edge of the roof truss between the top and bottom chords, increasing the heel height of the truss and therefore allowing a greater thickness of insulation to be installed. (For more choices, see H1 and sloping truss roof options in Build 191, pages 40–42.)
Choose the right building materials and elements
Industry suppliers have come up with a host of higher-performing materials and building elements to help with the new H1 compliance. Where the products that were used before no longer achieve the construction R-values required, new materials/elements will need to be specified.
These are some examples:
There are high-performance thermal insulation products available such as rigid foams that have higher R-values for a given thickness. Although insulated glazing units (IGUs) have been used in mainstream residential construction for many years, they have very often had no thermal break in the frame, no thermally improved spacer, and just dry air in the space between the panes. Today, thermal breaks, thermally improved spacers, low-E coatings and argon gas can make considerable improvements in their performance.
New products such as structural insulated panels (SIPs) may be a good option for some projects – they are already being used in residential construction here.
Find the right information
For roofs and walls, construction R-values can be calculated using NZS 4214:2006 Methods of determining the total thermal resistance of parts of building s or looked up in the BRANZ House insulation guide .
For windows and glazed doors, you can use Appendix E in H1/AS1 (Table E.1.1.1 in H1/AS1 can only be used for housing), calculate their R-values using H1/VM1 , or use proprietary software programs such as WINDOW or flixo. For skylights, Appendix E in H1/AS1 and H1/VM1 gives guidance (but not tables) for calculating construction R-values. The table for vertical windows cannot be used for skylights.
For slab floors, you can use the tables in Appendix F in H1/AS1 or calculate using Appendix F in H1/VM1 . The BRANZ House insulation guide includes the same slab floors plus some additional ones. For example, it includes slab floors that have topper insulation on top of the slab. These additional scenarios are helpful for those that struggle to find a slab that achieves the required R-value within the H1/AS1 look-up tables.
For other floor types, including suspended floors, you can use the BRANZ House insulation guide or calculate using NZS 4214:2006 .
What’s not in the new H1 documents
The new Acceptable Solutions and Verification Methods take a big step in the right direction in keeping our buildings warm, but they haven’t fully considered the risk of buildings overheating. (The need to consider overheating and tips for how to do this are briefly referred to in H1/AS1 section 2.3 – future Building Code changes are likely to address this in much more detail.) Overheating is a risk that BRANZ scientists are very aware of – in fact, several BRANZ research projects have found this is already a serious problem. Designers need to think carefully about reducing the risk of overheating and the increased energy costs and occupant discomfort this brings. Avoiding overheating requires careful attention to:
Shade devices – particularly considering the northern and western side of houses.
Ventilation – ideally cross-ventilation, but other types such as stack ventilation are also useful. Glazing – the size and location of windows and glazing specification, including the solar heat gain coefficient (see Solar heat gain coefficient for windows in Build 189, pages 36–37).
Another big concern of BRANZ scientists is internal moisture, especially the risks of moisture passing from the living areas in a house through to the wall assembly or roof space. Condensation in these areas can lead to mould, rot and corrosion, which can be bad for occupant health and material durability. BRANZ scientists have encountered this in several relatively new homes. The risk increases as our buildings become better insulated. It is crucial, therefore, for design and construction to be carried out in a way that stops moisture from living spaces passing through wall and ceiling linings – airtightness is a key parameter. H1/AS1 section 2.2 (comment 2) touches on this.
The gains are worth it
There is no doubt that the changes being introduced will be a challenge for practitioners who have in the past aimed for Building Code compliance on their project, without going much further. For example, the roof construction R-values are twice or more the previous requirements. The benefits in the changes are substantial too. MBIE modelling indicates that the new insulation requirements will reduce the heating energy requirements in new homes by 30–50% depending on the housing type and climate zone. That’s an achievement the industry can be proud to be part of.

With spring upon us, and summer around the corner, we are entering the high-risk period for early-age concrete cracking. This is the second article in a two-part series on how to prevent it
L ast month we looked at plastic shrinkage cracks. Another form of cracking that occurs during the plastic stage of the concrete setting process is plastic settlement cracking.
Most concrete bleeds after it’s placed. This means that water rises to the surface as the solid particles settle. The bleed water evaporates, reducing the concrete’s total volume, (ie, the concrete has ‘settled’). If there is no restraint, the net result is simply a very slight lowering of the surface level. However, if there is something near the surface – such as a reinforcing bar – which restrains part of the concrete from settling while the concrete on either side drops, a crack can form over the restraining element.
Settlement cracks tend to follow a regular pattern, replicating the lines of restraint — usually the reinforcement — or a change in section. Generally, the cracks are not deep, but because they tend to follow and penetrate down to the reinforcements, they may reduce a structure’s durability.
Plastic settlement is affected by the following:
The concrete’s bleed rate.
Time over which settlement can take place (ie, the time before set).
Depth of reinforcement relative to total thickness of the section.
Size of reinforcement.
Constituents of the mix.
Slump.
Plastic settlement cracks may be prevented, or rather closed, by revibrating the concrete after settlement is virtually complete and it has begun to set. However, the timing is critical and considerable experience is needed to know when that critical time is. If you revibrate too early, more settlement could occur; if you do it too late, it could damage the bond between the concrete and reinforcement.
Using the following may also help reduce plastic settlement cracks:
Lower slump mixes.
More cohesive mixes.
An air entrainer to improve cohesiveness and reduce bleeding.
Increasing cover to top bars.
With an understanding of the causes and precautions that can be taken to avoid plastic cracking, this common surface defect can easily be controlled.

Knowing what size trimming studs to use is easy once you understand how to use the tables in NZS 3604:2011 . Ensure you’re on the right track with the examples below.
NZS 3604:2011 timber-framed buildings includes the requirements that trimming studs:
Are to be the same width as the wall studs – ie, if the wall studs are 90 mm wide, the trimming studs must also be 90 mm wide.
Whether single or built up with multiple studs, must have no holes or notches in the middle third of the height of the stud.
Cannot include a doubling stud supporting a lintel that is more than 400 mm shorter than the wall studs.
The following examples and figures demonstrate how to select the correct size of trimming studs. The specific details to be used (see Figure 1) are:
Single or top storey.
Extra high wind zone.
Maximum of 2.7 m stud length.
Loaded dimension = 6 m.
Stud spacing = 600 mm centres.
Opening maximum = 3.3 m.
Light roof.
Use NZS 3604:2011 Table 8.9 ‘Lintel supporting roof only’ for all wind zones to determine the lintel size for the span and to make sure what is proposed is within the scope of NZS 3604:2011 .
In this example, a light roof with loaded dimension of 6 m requires a 290 × 90 mm lintel to span an opening of 3.3 m (see Figure 2).
Now go to Table 8.2 to determine the wall stud thickness required. This information is required to calculate the trimming stud size in Table 8.5.
For this example, choose (a) Single or top storey – light and heavy roof, extra high wind zone and loaded dimension of 6 m, then 2.7 m maximum stud length and maximum stud spacing of 600mm.  This gives a stud thickness of 90 mm (see Figure 3).
Go to Table 8.5 ‘Trimming studs’.
For this example, choose (a) Single storey, top storey or non-loadbearing walls. The maximum width of opening is 3.3 m, so the opening is over 3.0 m but under 3.6 m. Choose maximum clear width 3.6 m (see Figure 4).
Move to the centre column in Table 8.5 and choose the stud thickness that was obtained in step 2 – 90 mm in this example (see Figure 4).
Now read across to the right column in Table 8.5 to obtain the thickness of the trimming studs – 180 mm (see Figure 4).
Three 90 × 45 mm plus the doubling stud gives the required 180 mm trimming stud.
Because this lintel is less then 400 mm down, the doubling stud can be included in the total width of the trimming studs (see Figure 5).
Nailing of built-up members was covered in Build 136 June/July 2013, page 33, together with the requirements for lintels, trimming studs etc.

Recent BRANZ research has confirmed how moisture gets into roof spaces and highlighted the critical role ventilation plays in removing it
B efore the publication of BRANZ bulletin 302 in 1992, condensation problems in roofs were thought to be caused by diffusion, driven by differences in water vapour pressure.
Air movement is key
Recent BRANZ research has confirmed that air movement from internal spaces into roof spaces is the predominant means of moisture transport. It’s greater than moisture movement from diffusion by at least two orders of magnitude. So, why is air movement the predominant moisture transport agent ?
Typically, air pressures within a roof space at night are lower than those within the building. This means that there will be a flow of air from inside spaces to the roof spaces through gaps or cracks in or around the ceiling lining or open downlights. If moisture is present in the space below, it will be carried into the colder roof space and potentially condense on colder surfaces.
Stopping internal airflow
The transport of air through the ceiling and other surfaces connected to a roof can be dealt with by:
Avoiding openings in the ceiling – particularly open downlights.
Sealing penetrations, such as for wiring and lights.
Installing an airtight lining, such as flush-stopped plasterboard.
Installing an air barrier behind air-leaky linings, such as T&G boarding.
Ensuring spaces, that have high moisture levels, such as kitchens and bathrooms, are well ventilated, so that the moisture is removed before it can be transported into the roof spaces.
BRANZ research shows that controlling the relative humidity in the living quarters reduces the probability of roof moisture reaching high humidity levels by about half without the use of air barriers and vapour retarders.
Dealing with diffusion
As with air pressure, night-time vapour pressure is usually higher within building spaces than within a roof space.
Specifying vapour retarders, such as an oilborne coating, on the warm side of the building envelope for spaces with a high moisture load, such as kitchens and bathrooms, can be useful. This will prevent the moisture vapour transmission through lining materials and lower the risk of roof space moisture.
Ventilation is important, but …
Ventilation of a roof space was discussed in ‘Ventilation Dries Attic Space’ ( Build 148 , pages 78–79). Calculations at BRANZ show ventilation of the roof space will prevent some condensation, but not all. One reason is that cold outside air has very little moisture capacity, so is of limited use in controlling condensation effectively –particularly during the night.
Some moist air will be removed by airflow through the roof, but because New Zealand’s night-time outdoor air typically has a very high relative humidity, very little drying will occur. The cold night air introduced by ventilation can also be a source of condensation if, on clear nights, radiative cooling brings the temperature of the roof cladding below the dew point temperature. These conditions are reasonably frequent in parts of New Zealand.
Natural roof ventilation
Measurements have shown that the airtightness of roof spaces varies widely depending on climate, local pressure moderated by wind exposure and so on.
Currently, roof ventilation is usually provided by uncontrolled natural ventilation around the roof cladding specified. For example, a roof cladding such as corrugate or trapezoid profiled steel, metal tiles or concrete tiles all allow uncontrolled ventilation of the roof space to occur.
The other option would be to specifically detail ridge vents, eaves vents or gable end vents.
However, too much ventilation may have unwanted side effects, such as energy wastage.
Critical considerations
There is no New Zealand-specific rule of thumb or simple calculation to determine how much ventilation should be provided for a given roof design and location. During the building design process, critical parameters that need to be considered to achieve a well performing roof are:
Outdoor climate and radiative cooling.
Solar gain.
Wind speed and site exposure.
Ceiling construction and finishes.
Indoor moisture conditions (this is dependent on occupant behaviour).
Some of these factors can be readily identified, but others need to be estimated. New BRANZ research projects will make information available on air transport through different ceiling types and the occupant behaviour to help the design process.
Problems using foreign codes or standards
It can be tempting to use design tools from other countries when looking for solutions to roof ventilation. However, there is no certainty that these will work under New Zealand conditions and building practices.
Often, other countries have different compliance frameworks. These may make inaccurate assumptions about certain critical aspects of the performance of the building component.
For example, the Canadian Building Code, which is often cited in this roof design context, has an airtightness requirement that we do not have here.
A roof designed according to the Canadian Code without considering our code and climate will probably fail. This is because the Canadian airtightness target for the living quarters and their ventilation cannot be met.
Drying out
Condensation is not preventable under all circumstances. However, as long as the structure is allowed to return to its initial dry state over a period of time, the roof will manage the moisture load.

With summer fast approaching, now is a good time to brush up on your deck building skills, as homeowners prepare for long evenings spent around the BBQ
A n Acceptable Solution for deck construction is provided by NZS 3604:2011Timber-framed buildings . In this article, we’ll show you how to design and build an external open-slatted timber deck.
An L-shaped deck addition is proposed for an existing house. It will be 6.3m long in one direction, project 3.0m from the face of the building and have a total area of 21m² (see Figure 1). The finished deck level will be 100mm below the floor level of the house.
Getting started
The requirements of foundations, subfloor framing, bracing, decking selection, fastenings and fixings can be found in NZS 3604 section 7.4.
The house is in earthquake zone 3 ( NZS 3604 Figure 5.4 ). As there is no subsoil classification, E must be assumed and a multiplication factor of 1.0 ( NZS 3604 clause 5.3.3 and Table 5.8 ) used for bracing calculations.
The section slopes away from the house, starting at approximately 1.0m below floor level adjacent to the house to approximately 2.0m below floor level at the edge of the deck.
Joists are to be cantilevered 900mm beyond the line of the piles and bearer (see Figure 1).
The building owner would like to use a 32mm Kwila decking, so joist spacing may be up to 600mm. However, as the deck is to support a cantilevered alustrade, NZS 3604 clause 7.4.1.3 requires that joists must be at 400 centres maximum and at least 190mm deep.
Step 1: Select the timber
New Zealand Building Code clause B2 Durability sets out the durability requirements for building elements and cites NZS 3602:2003 Timber and wood-based products for use in building for timber treatment levels.
Generally, structural elements must have not less than 50-year durability, and stairs, handrails and decking require not less than 15-year durability. All tructural fixings must have the same durability as the elements with which they are associated and will need to be stainless steel.
So, from NZS 3602: Table 1:
Piles must be H5 treated (ground contact).
All other structural members – ie, bearers, stringer, braces, joists and safety barrier support posts –must be at least H3.2 treated (exposed to the exterior but not in ground contact).
NZS 3604 clause 2.3.2 requires SG8 (structural grade) timber for wet-in-service conditions.
Step 2: Calculate the bracing requirement
Using the multiplication factor E for zone 3 = 1.0
15 BU/m² × 1.0 = 15 BU/m²
Paragraph 7.4.2.2 states that decks that project more than 2.0m from the building require subfloor bracing at half the bracing demand required by Table 5.8 for ‘light/light/light’ cladding, 0° roof pitch and for ‘subfloor structures’.
Divide the number of BUs required by two:
15 BU/m² / 2 = 7.5 BU/m² are required.
Multiply the number of BU/m2 by the area of the deck to obtain the total BUs required for the deck:
7.5 BU/m² × 21m² = 157.5 BUs in each direction.
Bracing may be provided by anchor, braced and cantilevered piles. NZS 3604 section 6 Brace pile gives the bracing capacity ratings of subfloor bracing lements. Both anchor and braced piles provide 120 BUs per bracing element.
However, as anchor piles may only be 600mm above ground level, and the ground level is 1.0–2.0m below the deck, anchor piles cannot be used.
Similarly, cantilevered piles may only extend 1.2m maximum above ground level and in addition provide only 30 BUs per pile, requiring more cantilevered piles to achieve the BUs needed.
Braced pile systems offer the best solution. As they provide 120 BUs for earthquake resistance, two braced pile systems are required in each direction.
Braces will be less than 3.0m long, so the brace size may be 100 × 75mm.
Step 3: Selecting joists
As the line of support (ie, piles and bearer) is 2.1m from the house, according to NZS 3604 Table 7.1(b) (2 kPa floor load and wet in service), 140 × 45mm joists may be used, and Table 7.2 for cantilevered joists allows a cantilever of up to 1150mm.
However, at the bottom of Table 7.2, a note states that 140mm joist depth is insufficient where cantilevered balustrades are to be used (as in this situation).
So, select the next size up: 190 × 45mm joists . At 400 centres, these may cantilever up to 1600mm.
Step 4: Selecting bearers
Select bearers from NZS 3604 Table 6.4 (b) (2 kPa floor load and wet in service).
To determine the loaded dimension of the bearers, refer to NZS 3604 Definitions.
From Figure 1.3(G), the loaded dimension = (span 1/2) + span 2 (where span 1 = 2.1m and span 2 = 900mm) = 2.1/2 + 900 = 1.95m
From NZS 3604 Table 6.4(b) (2 kPa floor load and wet in service):
For maximum bearer span = 1.3 and a loaded dimension of 2.3m, bearer = 140 × 70mm, or
For maximum bearer span = 1.65 and loaded dimension 2.7m, bearer = 190 × 70mm.
Use 140 × 70mm bearers with supports at 1.3m centres maximum.
Step 5: Selecting stringers
Stringers will be used against the house.
Ideally, stringers should be packed off and fixed to the foundation wall.
Maximum joist span is 2.1m, so from NZS 3604 Table 6.5 , the stringer may be either:
140 × 45mm or 190 × 45mm
Both will need bolt fixings at 1600mm centres.
Step 6: Selecting piles and footings
A combination of ordinary and braced piles must be used. Select 140mm diameter timber piles.
For pile footings, use NZS 3604 Table 6.1.
For ordinary piles:
Maximum bearer span = 1.3m; maximum joist span = 2.1m.
Footings – 260mm diameter, 200mm minimum deep ( NZS 3604 Figure 6.2 ).
For braced piles:
Two systems in each direction.
Footings – 400mm diameter, 450mm minimum deep ( NZS 3604 clause 6.8.1.1 ).
Step 7: String fixing through cladding
When installing slatted timber decking, leave:
A 12mm minimum gap between the stringer and the decking.
A 12mm minimum gap between the cladding and the decking for drainage (E2/AS1 paragraph 7.1.1) – see Figures 3 and 4.
A 3–6mm gap between decking timbers lengthways ( NZS 3604 recommends using a 100 × 3.75mm nail as a spacer) to allow timber movement due to moisture and temperature changes and for water to drain.

The basic function of residential pavements, such as driveways, paths and patios, is to provide safe and easy access onto or around a property. Concrete is typically used to not only provide a durable paving surface (sloped, to provide surface water run-off) but one which can also incorporate a wide range of decorative finishes to complement the design and landscaping of the residence.
While creating a concrete pavement is relatively straightforward, there are a number of design and construction aspects that need to be considered in order to produce a finished product that satisfies the functional and aesthetic requirements of the homeowners.
“When concrete is not cured (ie is allowed to dry out too quickly), a significant reduction in its strength results
Residential pavements for foot and light vehicular traffic should be cured for a minimum period of three days. This should be increased to seven days if located near the coast (within 1 km) and/or subject to heavier traffic. Curing allows the concrete to achieve its potential strength and durability. When concrete is not cured (ie is allowed to dry out too quickly), a significant reduction in its strength results. The reduction of concrete strength has a significant effect on abrasion resistance of the surface of the pavement when used by vehicular traffic. One of the main contributors to surface wear and dusting problems is the reduction in strength due to inadequate compaction and curing.
Typical methods of curing concrete pavements include:
Covering the concrete with an impermeable membrane (eg plastic sheeting weighted in contact with the surface or a chemical curing compound complying with AS 3799 or ASTM C309).
Keeping any exposed surfaces continuously wet (eg ponding or spraying with water).
Wetting at intervals (eg in the morning and afternoon) does not keep the concrete continuously moist, particularly in hot weather conditions, and is therefore not regarded as an adequate method.
Black plastic should not be used for curing of external surfaces, as this may increase heat gain and cause problems with slab curling.
“One of the main contributors to surface wear and dusting problems is the reduction in strength due to inadequate compaction and curing
Decorative concrete pavements should not be cured with plastic sheeting, damp sand or wet hessian, as these materials may promote uneven colour or staining.
Chemical curing compounds compatible with the sealer, or the sealer itself, if complying with the requirements of a chemical curing compound, should be used for these types of decorative pavements.
Concrete should not be placed at ambient temperatures higher than 30°C or lower than 5°C with the temperature descending or below 2°C with the temperature ascending. In hot weather, early loss of moisture from the slab causing plastic cracking of the surface can occur as the rate of evaporative drying exceeds the rate of bleeding, resulting in the surface drying out prematurely.
A combination of hot weather, low humidity and windy conditions increases the risk of plastic cracking. The use of an evaporative retarder, such as  aliphatic alcohol (antivap), will slow down the rate of evaporation. The use of windbreaks and shade covers will help but may not be practical in extreme weather.
In cold weather, delayed setting and finishing times, slower strength gain and even freezing of the surface are of concern. Concrete should be protected from freezing for at least 24 hours after finishing by covering the surface with insulating blankets.
Where there is a high temperature swing, in excess of 13°C from daytime to nighttime following the pour, the concrete may crack and should be covered with an insulating blanket.

Changes proposed to NZS 3916 could, if adopted, shift more risk from design consultants to contractors
Standard form contracts in Aotearoa New Zealand are changing. After completing and publishing the new NZS 3910:2023 Conditions of contract for building and civil engineering construction , Standards New Zealand is turning its attention to related standards such as NZS 3916:2013 Conditions of contract for building and civil engineering – Design and construct and NZS 3917:2013 Conditions of contract for building and civil engineering – Fixed term.
Responses being reviewed
A draft of DZ 3916:2025 was published for public consultation in February. The consultation period has now ended and the standards committee is reviewing responses. Once this process is complete, the new NZS 3916 will be published.
Many of the proposed changes are intended to bring NZS 3916 into line with NZS 3910:2023. Key mechanisms introduced in NZS 3910, such as the new roles of contract administrator and independent certifier (which divide the functions previously performed by the engineer), will be adopted into NZS 3916 without further review.
In contrast, other changes carried over from NZS 3910 , such as the liability limit in clause 7.2, may warrant further consideration in the design and build context. Consultants’ liability limits are likely to differ from those under NZS 3916 , creating a gap risk where contractors may face additional liability.
Significant aspects of NZS 3916:2013 also remain unchanged, including the contractor’s warranty at clause 5.1.8 that the principal’s requirements are suitable, appropriate and adequate. These unamended provisions may be raised during the consultation process for further review.
Key amendments
Several changes are specific to the NZS 3916 contract and have a unique impact on design and build projects that use it. While many of these are beneficial, others introduce what BRANZ believes is unnecessary risk transfer. Outlined below are the key amendments in the current draft that are unique to a design and build context.
Definitions (clause 1.2)
‘Principal’s requirements’ have been redefined to the requirements ‘included in the contract and identified as the principal’s requirements, including the documents and any drawings and specifications listed in ‘contract agreement annexure 1 – list of principal’s requirements’. A corresponding annexure is intended to list the principal’s requirements in a single place.
This approach should make the contract easier to navigate. However, the current drafting does not guarantee that all the principal’s requirements will be listed in annexure 1. Material captured by the broader reference to requirements ‘included in the contract’ could still be littered throughout the contract documents.
Ideally, this drafting will be tightened with further review to reduce the potential for uncertainty.
Deeds of novation (clause 4.3.1)
Deeds of novation arise where the principal’s existing agreements with design consultants are transferred to the contractor. The 2013 version of NZS 3916 dealt with this situation under clause 4.1.4. The new clause adds a requirement that the principal provide any deeds of novation to the contractor for execution within 10 working days after the tender is accepted.
While this is helpful, a gap remains. There is still no requirement for the principal to execute the deeds, nor are there any consequences for failing to do so. Given the importance of such transfers, it would be preferable to provide the contractor a right to claim a variation where the principal fails to provide executed deeds.
Submission and rejection of design documentation (clauses 5.1.10 and 5.1.11(b))
Under clause 5.1.10, the principal will be able to require that the contractor submits design documentation to the contract administrator at the stages of design development set out in the specific conditions.
Clause 5.1.11(b) requires the contract administrator to include reasons if they reject the design documentation and to only reject if, in their ‘reasonable opinion’, the documentation is non-compliant with the principal’s requirements. These changes are likely to be useful in that the administrator will need to clarify why a design is rejected and ensure there are good reasons for it.
Contractor-arranged professional indemnity insurance (clause 8.6)
One proposed change concerns the length of time that a contractor’s professional indemnity insurance must be in place. The timeframe under the 2013 version is until completion plus 5 years. This would change to completion plus six years.
The other proposed change would allow insurance to comprise either annual renewable policies or a single policy covering the full period specified above. The current 2013 version generally only permits the single policy option, although it does allow for annual renewable policies until completion of the contract works.
Compliance with variations (clause 9.1.4)
Under this clause, a contractor is required to comply with any variation unless it falls under one of three stated grounds. The proposed amendments would adjust the number of working days for the contractor to notify the contract administrator – and for the contract administrator to amend the instruction – and would remove the ‘health and safety in the workplace’ ground. Given the importance of health and safety generally, BRANZ disagrees with its removal here.
Notice of variation (clause 9.2)
Under the revised clause, the contract and contract administrator must ‘endeavour to agree’ as to whether a matter raised in a notice of variation involves a variation. The contract administrator must then issue an instruction within 10 working days of that agreement. If no agreement can be reached, the issue can be referred for determination by the independent certifier within 20 working days.
This change reflects the introduction of two roles to replace the engineer. Under the 2013 version of NZS 3916 , the engineer has sole responsibility for determining this matter and must do so within one month of receiving the notice of variation. This process was also revised in NZS 3910:2023 but with different wording.
DZ 3916:2025 introduces shorter timeframes, omits the stage where the contract administrator confirms whether the matter constitutes a variation and proceeds directly to the independent certifier deciding in the absence of agreement.
Once the new NZS 3916 is published, be sure to check it out.

Proper on-site management of wall cladding is critical to delivering quality buildings. This article is the last instalment of a series talking about specific storage requirements for cladding types
Wall claddings are what we see when we approach a building, and any defects from poor handling, storage or installation may be visible. They can also affect the durability of the cladding.
Prefinished profiled or plank metal claddings
There is risk of damage to the prefinished surface and denting of the materials. Once installed, they must be protected from cement splashes that can mar the surface.
Store under a water-resistant cover, clear of the ground to provide airflow around the bundle.
If the material has become wet during transportation or in storage, wipe it down to remove moisture and then fillet or cross stack it to ensure air circulation between the sheets.
If sheeting has been wet in storage for more than three days, it should not be used because of the permanent surface staining that may have occurred.
When handling and storing:
Evenly position the materials on untreated, evenly spaced dunnage to prevent deformation – packs should be no greater than 1000 mm high and on a slight incline to allow water run-off.
Store the material in the order it will be installed.
Peel and lift the sheets off the bundle – do not slide or drag sheets or planks across each other or over rough surfaces.
Sheets or planks longer than 3m should be handled by two people and carried on their edge to avoid buckling.
Keep material clear of any substances that may cause damage.
Tie down stored material and accessories, as they are susceptible to wind damage.
Strippable protective film must not be exposed to sunlight or UV during storage – remove the film immediately after installation.
Zinc Claddings
Transport and store zinc claddings under dry, ventilated conditions, so white rust does not form. Avoid any contact between wet sheeting or tarpaulins and the surface of the metal during storage.
For good transportation and storage of zinc, ensure:
Good air movement around stored materials.
It is stored on dry, covered pallets on a dry floor.
It is tightly stacked to prevent chafing.
Sheets are protected from abrasion.
Material can sit unopened for several days to allow for acclimation to the storage area’s temperature and humidity.
Acidic perspiration and fingerprints are immediately removed – wear clean gloves when handling material during transportation, fabrication and installation.
All strippable film (PVC) is removed as soon as possible after installation – partial removal may give an uneven patina. Avoid shopapplied protective films as these may trap air and moisture leading to formation of zinc hydroxide stains.
Glass as a cladding
Glass used as a curtain wall cladding material is arguably the most fragile material covered here and, when used with some other claddings, the most susceptible to damage. Handling and storage requirements for glass include:
Leaving the glass within any protective crating until use.
Storing individual sheets of glass on edge supported by dunnage with an isolating layer between sheets.
Storing and handling away from metal and other brittle materials and operations such as placing concrete.
Keeping the glass dry.
Using the correct lifting apparatus to prevent edge or surface damage.
Securing the glass back to a rigid structure to prevent overturning.
Metal-faced panels
Metal-faced panels with aluminium, steel or magnesium oxide board come in various options, including thin-stressed, prefinished aluminium or steel skin panels with a polystyrene or polyurethane foam core in several thicknesses.
While more commonly used on commercial buildings, both panel types are utilised as wall cladding systems on residential buildings.
Ideally, panels should be delivered and lifted into their final position. If they need to be stored:
Stack clear of the ground on evenly spaced bearers.
Leave the protective film in place until panels are installed.
Fully cover to keep them dry.
Exterior insulation and finish systems
Specific material storage and handling requirements for exterior insulation and finish systems (EIFS) – polystyrene overcoated with acrylic or polymer modified cement plaster – include:
Storing polystyrene sheets under cover on a level platform protected from UV.
Providing a dry storage area for the powdered components of the plaster.
Minimising exposure of the polystyrene to UV once erected – any yellowing of the surface from UV must be removed before plastering commences.
Precast concrete
Precast concrete component deliveries should be planned so the panels can be lifted directly into position and braced. Where panels must be stored, they must be placed on strong and level supports positioned so precast components are not subject to excessive stress.
Recommended quality control checks include:
Structural defects – cracks.
Dimensional tolerances are within the limits specified.
Surface finish quality is as specified.
Physical damage – chipping or staining.
Shrinkage cracking.
Lightweight aerated concrete
Lightweight aerated concrete is supplied as panels or blocks that are then plastered. Storage requirements include:
Providing dry storage for panels and blocks and components of the plaster system.
Avoiding sagging or damage to ends, edges and surfaces.
Storing uPVC accessories flat and protected from direct sunlight.
A maximum stack height of two panel bundles.
Stacking panels on edge on dunnage.
When handling lightweight aerated concrete:
Utilise supplier-developed handling systems such as hoists, lifters and trolleys — some suppliers require the use of approved lifting devices for unloading and moving materials.
Keep manual handling to a minimum for larger items.
Ensure appropriate bracing is installed to packs prior to removal of strapping to prevent panels from falling.
Packs should be unloaded and stored as close as possible to the intended installation area.
Cladding system components and accessories
Some cladding systems require the application of plasters or use of mortars to complete the installation. Store dry components such as:
Cement and finishing plasters in a dry, protected area.
Sand covered to protect from contamination such as dirt and cat faeces.
Fibreglass mesh protected from sun.
Flexible wall underlays under cover to protect from damage, water and UV.
Bright steel nails in dry conditions.
Liquid or flexible components must be stored in frost-free conditions. There are also recommended temperatures that should not be exceeded. Silicone rubber stored at 27°C, for example, will have a shelf life of about six months. Material stored at 38°C will have a shelf life of about two months.
It is also important to rotate stored stock such as cement, primer, sealants and adhesives to ensure material is within its use-by date.

The Ministry of
Business, Innovation and Employment ( MBIE) has funded over 120 building standards
After hearing
concerns by building practitioners that the cost of standards can be a barrier
to applying best practice, MBIE hopes free download availability will remove
barriers and improve compliance with the Building Code.
The selected standards were identified specifically as those that directly help demonstrate compliance with the Building Code and will have the best chance of improving results in safe and well-constructed buildings and homes. Freely available standards include NZS 3604:2011 Timber-framed buildings,  NZS 3109:1997 Concrete construction, NZS 3404.1&2:1997 Steel structures standard, and NZS 4229:2013 Concrete masonry buildings not requiring specific engineering design.
The list of free standards includes 85 current and 35 superseded standards. This means people can look back on standards like NZS 3604 and see changes over time. View list of standards here:
https://www.standards.govt.nz/assets/Publication-files/BSP/List-of-Building-Related-Sponsored-Standards.pdf
This isn’t the
first time MBIE has removed the cost barrier from standards. In December 2017,
five prominent building standards and a handbook were made available by MBIE
free of charge, attracting more than 15,000 downloads in the last 18 months.
New Zealand is
now one of the few countries in the world providing free access to building
standards.
The available standards can be accessed through the Standards New Zealand website , and indirectly through www.building.govt.nz and www.codehub.building.govt.nz

The performance of a membrane roof is influenced by how well the substrate has been installed. The guidelines below outline how to install plywood substrates for a membrane roof
There are two potential pitfalls when it comes to installing plywood substrates.
A substrate that isn’t constructed with enough fall might result in rainwater not draining away.
If the membrane is applied over a wet substrate the membrane may not “stick”, bubbles may form.
Acceptable Solution E2/AS1 only covers butyl or EPDM membranes over plywood substrates with a minimum fall of 2°. BRANZ recommends a higher minimum fall of 3° to ensure better run-off, but builders should follow the fall specified in the consented plans.
The plywood should be specified by the designer. It will typically be H3 CCA-treated and kiln-dried CD grade structural ply of 17mm minimum thickness. LOSP-treated ply is usually not suitable.
Check the membrane manufacturer‘s technical literature for their particular plywood substrate requirements – there are subtle differences in construction requirements.
These are some common E2/AS1 and manufacturers’ requirements:
Ensure that the roofing substructure is dry and has the required fall and that there will be a minimum 20mm gap between insulation and plywood.
Install the ply with the smoothest (sanded) face upwards.
Lay in a staggered joint pattern (brick bond) with the face grain of the top ply layer at right angles to the supporting framing.
Ensure the ply is supported by framing at 400mm maximum centres and at all edges.
Fix sheets with countersunk 10g x 50mm stainless steel screws at 150mm centres to the edges (100mm in very high /extra high wind zones) and 200mm centres within the sheet area. Some membrane manufacturers also require that the ply is glued down to framing.
Check the membrane manufacturer’s technical literature for the width of joints. Liquid-applied membranes typically require 2mm to 3mm gaps between sheets, while sheet joints can be loose-butted with torch-on systems.
Allow a perimeter expansion gap of 5mm where sheets are within a confined area (for example, surrounded by parapets).
Provide arrises of minimum 5mm radius (10mm is better) to all external edges.
Chamfer or radius corners where the membrane is turned down into a gutter.
Install 20mm H3.2 angle fillets to vertical upstands (except for some thermoplastic membranes).
Fill/level holes or cracks.
Sand the filler, joints and countersunk drill holes to remove splinters.
Vacuum (or use a leaf blower) to remove surface dust and dirt.
Keep the substrate dry – E2/AS1 requires that ply and substructure have a maximum moisture content reading of 20% at membrane installation (BRANZ recommends a maximum of 18%). Cover with tarpaulins at the end of each day and when rain is forecast.
For more information, see E2/AS1 or BRANZ Good Practice Guide Membrane Roofing (second edition, 2015).

It’s undeniable that the construction sector is booming. However, for many businesses that isn’t reflected in their bottom lines
T he ANZ Bank recently released the results of its Privately Owned Business Barometer, which included survey data on the construction industry.
Many people will be both pleased and concerned to know that the survey’s results line up with the view of the sector that it’s tough out there.This month, we look at a few key financial areas that ANZ highlighted in its report and what business owners can do to address those issues.
A major point to come out of the survey was the main difficulty for many companies in maintaining a strong margin on work performed. The gross margin – sales minus costs of sales (payments to workers, materials, etc) – is arguably the most important metric fora construction-based company to track.
This is because it identifies wherea company’s profit sits. If a company has low margins, then it cannot cover overheads such as accounting fees, rents, telephone charges, etc.
The ANZ survey reported that builders are struggling to maintain a reasonable margin. This means that there is a lot of competition out there for work, and many companies are dropping prices in order to win work. This phenomenon is known as the ‘race to the bottom’ for a reason. If retail companies sold products for less than what they paid for them, they would never make a profit.
This serves to reinforce the importance of accurately costing out jobs and knowing prices before bidding on work (see this month’s article about quoting jobs on page 22 ). An alternative approach could be to choose jobs carefully and compete on something other than price, such as becoming renowned for quality or speed of work. This approach, however, isn’t as easy as it sounds, given that many start-ups will initially accept low margins in order to secure work. While this may be a strategy for some companies, it’s important to keep in mind that, if a business can’t afford to drop its prices in order to win work, it shouldn’t. As a barometer, businesses should aim for a minimum gross margin of 20-25% (gross margin as a percentage of sales) on every job.
After low margins, the research identified that business owners are too busy to follow up slow payers and invoices are often not collected in a timely manner. This sounds crazy – why would a business perform work for free ? Most companies pay suppliers on 30-day terms, so if an organisation isn’t collecting on its own invoices then it will quickly run out of cash. This will leave the business exposed on its next job and forever chasing its tail. That kind of approach gave rise to the old saying: ‘working on the business rather than in it’.
Invoice collection needs to be a major focus for any business owner. If an owner doesn’t have time to chase invoices, then it should be given to a third party company that chases collection and takes a percentage of the payment. We have many clients who use this option and they, more often than not, have great collection rates and never have to consider using a debt collector.
Benchmarking also rated a mention in the ANZ report. According to the survey, only 15% of companies benchmark annually, while 28% of businesses stated they never do. We suspect the latter figures to be much higher. Benchmarking is hugely underutilised and is crucial for really knowing how a business is performing.
Using the gross margin as an example, a business may be achieving a gross margin of 25% and find that it is not making a profit. If the industry average is 20% and other businesses are turning a profit, then pricing is clearly not the issue. In this case, overheads would need to be examined to determine what needed to be cut back on, in order to be in-line with the rest of the industry.
Crowe Horwath has run a number of successful benchmarking sessions with construction industry clients that have led to large increases in both gross margin and profit.
If you have any questions about points raised in this article or would like to discuss how your business is going in these busier times, we can help. Please contact Peter van der Heijden at peter.vdh@crowehorwath.co.nz ; or your local Crowe Horwath advisor.
Crowe Horwath has teamed up with Minter Ellison Rudd Watts and the BNZ to provide a free comprehensive training session to give you and your business the tools it needs, in order to achieve success. The next session is in South Auckland, 18 November. For further information or expressions of interest, please contact us at Auckland@crowehorwath.co.nz .

There’s good ground and then there’s cleared ground. From time to time, the BRANZ helpline receives enquiries asking what the difference is, so here’s a quick recap
The terms ‘good ground’ and ‘cleared ground level’ are defined in 1.3 Definitions of NZS 3604:2011 Timber-framed buildings:
Good ground is any soil or rock capable of permanently withstanding an ultimate bearing capacity of 300kPa.
Cleared ground level (CGL) is the ground level after completion of site excavation and removal of harmful material but before excavation for foundations.
What does this mean?
In other words, cleared ground is the ground ready to be built on and achieved by preparation such as clearing off plant material and topsoil.
Good ground, however, must have a bearing capacity, in addition to its own weight, able to support the load of a building without undergoing significant settlement. To establish good ground, the area of the proposed building must be tested.
Determining good ground
The initial assessment for determining good ground – set out in NZS 3604:2011 section 3.1.3 – is observing that:
Neighbouring buildings show no sign of settlement.
There is no evidence of erosion, landslides or ground creep either on the site or adjacent sites.
Excavation reveals no evidence of buried services or fill material.
Excavation does not reveal organic soil, soft or expansive clay, or peat.
Other investigations include referring to the project information memorandum and other territorial authority records such as local history of the site and published geological data.
Testing ground bearing capacity
To establish the ground’s ultimate bearing capacity of 300kPa, a scala penetrometer method of testing must be used. The test requirements are described in NZS 3604:2011 section 3.3.
A scala penetrometer – also known as a dynamic cone penetrometer – consists of a calibrated rod driven into the ground at various locations with a sliding weight or hammer that is raised and allowed to drop onto an anvil.
The number of blows required to achieve a particular depth of penetration into the ground establishes the soil’s bearing capacity. Where testing shows the ground does not meet the bearing  capacity required, the foundation of the proposed building will need specific engineering design (SED).
Testing depths
Testing depths required under NZS 3604:2011 are:
2m minimum for strip or pile foundations.
600mm minimum below the depth of short driven timber piles.

Relieve the pain of a bad finish by ensuring you’re curing concrete correctly
Almost without exception, technical specifications call for concrete to be cured; however, the process is not always undertaken correctly.
Why cure concrete?
Curing is the name given to procedures that promote the hydration of cement. The following focuses on the control of moisture movement, although temperature control is also needed.
When water is added to cement, a complex chemical reaction occurs which hydrates the cement and, in time, produces a firm, hard mass. This reaction continues when water is present. If the water is removed, the reaction stops, which results in the cement being only partially hydrated.
Concrete is therefore cured to control the rate and extent of moisture loss during cement hydration.
What are the advantages?
Moisture loss from the surface of concrete has the potential to impact on strength and durability, and cause early-age cracking.
The strength of concrete is predominantly determined by the water/cement ratio and the degree of hydration. If premature drying occurs, the hydration process will stop and the desired strength of the concrete will not be attained.
To appreciate this, it’s useful to visualise the chemical reaction of cement and water as a process whereby thin needles begin to grow out of each grain of cement after water is added.
As these needles grow, they become intertwined and it’s this interlocking process that gives concrete its strength. If the water dries up, the needles stop growing and less intermeshing occurs, resulting in loss of strength.
Therefore, inadequate curing can result in a weak concrete surface, which may wear under the abrasive action of traffic. Curing will also impact on the ability of the concrete to protect the reinforcement from corrosion.
The longer that water is present, the more intertwined the cement needles will become and the denser the concrete cover will be. This will make the concrete cover more watertight, increasing the time it takes before conditions around the reinforcing bar cause corrosion.
Another important feature of curing is its impact on the potential for early-age cracking, which occurs when tensile stresses in concrete exceed tensile strength. Tensile stresses can develop in the surface of concrete when the top dries and starts to shrink, while the saturated core of the concrete resists against the surface.
If curing doesn’t commence as early as possible, moisture can escape from the pores of the concrete near the surface. This creates negative pressure in the capillaries, causing the solid particles to draw closer together (shrinkage). If curing prevents moisture escape, surface shrinkage will be avoided and the concrete is given the chance to gain some strength with time.
What are the options available?
Methods of curing concrete fall broadly into the following:
• Those that minimise moisture loss from the concrete by covering them with relatively watertight membranes.
• Those that prevent moisture loss by continuously wetting the surface.
Which is best?
This depends on the project; however, a few things to keep in mind are:
• If using water curing, the surface must be kept continuously moist. Ensure that run-off water doesn’t enter streams or the storm water system, as it may have an adverse effect on aquatic life.
• Curing with polythene may result in some discolouration of the surface. The effectiveness of this curing method is greatly reduced if it’s not kept securely in place.
• Membrane curing compounds may not be compatible with subsequent coverings. They can also exist on the surface for a long time, meaning it may take time for the slab to dry sufficiently to apply adhesives and surface coverings such as vinyl. There is also a finite window of application, typically when the bleed water is no longer rising to the surface.

Thanks to feedback from readers, BRANZ clarifies some of the issues around holes and penetrations in bottom plates
I n Build 186 and Under Construction December 2021/January 2022 , the article Important to Keep the Bottom Plate Whole covered the issue of holes and penetrations in bottom plates of timber-framed walls. Feedback from readers to BRANZ suggests that further clarification is required.
Maintaining structural adequacy
The article suggested that the absence of fixing information to concrete slabs in NZS 3604:2011 Timber-framed buildings implied that bottom plate penetrations were not permitted with concrete floor slabs. This is unrealistic, and so this article suggests a way to maintain structural adequacy.
Ideally, a bottom plate would run for the full length of the wall without interruption. Its primary purpose is to anchor the wall to the floor or foundation, and NZS 3604:2011 provides for fixings to a timber and concrete floor for this purpose. However, to accommodate manageable timber lengths and frame sizes, joints are sometimes needed, and the frame detailer will take this into account.
When holes in plate are unavoidable
The article also discussed holes in the plate required for service penetrations such as waste pipes, where lack of planning means decisions must be made on site in a more ad hoc way.
Designers can minimise these situations by locating bracing elements to avoid wet areas and kitchens where possible, or better still, run the pipes in purpose-made ducts or shafts.
Where a plate joint or service penetration becomes unavoidable, it is essential that the plate is fixed to the floor on each side of the joint or penetration to limit sideways movement of the wall.
If the penetration is required in the middle of a bracing element, it is even more important that the cut-out is as short as possible, and that the plate is adequately fixed to the floor.
When the floor is a concrete slab
NZS 3604:2011 clause 8.7.5.2 provides for a 100 × 3.75mm nail each side of the penetration, but is silent on the equivalent for a concrete floor slab.
BRANZ suggests that at least a single 75mm shot-fired fastener on each side of the penetration should be used in this situation. The bottom plate must also be able to still accommodate the full set of required fasteners for the sheet bracing element as well as the end fixings to the slab as required .

Retaining walls can be subjected to large amounts of force, so they need to be well built and well designed, including those that don’t require a consent Retaining walls support the ground where there is a slope or change of grade. They must withstand the combined loads of the soil, water content and any surcharge or extra load, such as sloping backfill, building or vehicle loads. Consents when height exceeds 1.5m A building consent is not required under clause 1(c) Exempt building work of Schedule 1 to the Building Act 2004 only when:
A wall retains no more than 1.5m of ground; and, does not support any surcharge.
A building consent must be obtained in all other situations. Where consent is not required, the wall must still comply with the Building Code, including clauses B1 Structure, B2 Durability and F4 Safety from falling. BRANZ recommends that advice is sought from a chartered professional structural engineer for all walls over 1m high. Drainage needed behind wall Retaining walls must have drainage behind them to prevent water build-up, which can increase the load or lateral pressure and reduce the wall’s bearing capacity.
Place a minimum thickness of 300mm of clean metal or gravel drainage material immediately behind the wall, extended from the base to within 150–200mm of the wall’s top.
All retaining walls must have a subsoil drain falling to the storm water system and covered with a filter cloth or sock installed behind the foot of the wall to remove water. Weepholes must be provided through the base of a mass gravity wall and may be installed as a hydrostatic relief in other solid walls. BRANZ also recommends that:
Subsoil drainage is installed behind open retaining wall systems, such as crib walls.
A layer of filter cloth is installed to separate the drainage material and the soil behind the wall.
Types of retaining walls There are several different retaining wall construction systems, including:
Gravity walls, including mass gravity and crib walls.
Segmental retaining walls, including mechanically stabilised embankment (MSE) walls.
Concrete or concrete masonry cantilever retaining walls.
Gabion walls.
Select a wall system that suits the site and soil conditions. Other factors to consider include the ability to get materials to the location of the wall, ease of construction, cost, appearance, drainage and water table level, as well as the distance from any adjacent slopes. Proprietary systems are available. These should be constructed in accordance with the manufacturer’s information.
Mass gravity wall A mass gravity wall gets its stability from its mass or weight. It has a low height-to-width ratio and is sloped back towards the bank (see Figure 1). They are either built of concrete, stone or a combination of the two and must be laid on good ground as defined by NZS 3604:2011. Crib retaining wall Crib walls also retain by mass, but the mass or weight is obtained from the backfilled material placed in the wall.
They consist of either H5-treated timber or concrete interlocking header and stretcher units laid in alternate tiers, with a 1:4 backward slope or batter.
Once the units are laid, the whole structure is backfilled with granular drainage material (see Figures 2 and 3). The first stretcher course is laid on a concrete foundation or a compacted base to create the correct batter. The outer section of the wall may be filled with soil to enable planting of creeping or trailing plants.
Segmental retaining wall Segmental or modular block retaining walls consist of dry-stacked (without mortar), interlocking concrete blocks.
The blocks interlock at each course (see Figures 4 and 5) and are stepped back to create the batter. Additional stability is provided by filling the hollow blocks with soil.
Alternatively, shear pin systems are sometimes used to secure the blocks. Segmental retaining walls may also have geogrid reinforcing fabric buried in layers in the compacted backfill behind the wall to provide additional stability to the soil. These systems are referred to as mechanically stabilised embankment (MSE) walls.
Cantilever wall Cantilever walls provide support either by the installation of a wide, horizontal footing at the base or by cantilevered poles embedded in the ground. Wide-footing cantilever walls can be constructed from in situ reinforced concrete or pre-cast concrete masonry block with a concrete footing (see Figures 6 and 7).
For masonry cantilevered walls up to 2.2m high, details in NZS 4229:2013 may be used for the design.
Timber cantilever walls have H5-treated timber poles embedded vertically into the ground to a depth approximately equal to the wall’s height.
Poles are typically installed 900mm to 1200mm apart.
They project above the ground to support horizontal, H4-treated timber half rounds or interlocking tongue and groove boards behind the poles (see Figure 8). Design details may be available from pole suppliers.
Gabion wall Gabion walls also rely on the mass of the wall to provide retaining. They consist of steel mesh baskets filled with locally sourced rocks or stones, which may be tied together and stacked in tiers.
The baskets can be made to any shape or wall configuration, but they should not exceed a 2:1 height-to-width ratio and may be inclined up to 7°. Gabion walls do not need concrete foundations, but the bottom of the wall should be 150–200mm below the finished ground level to provide stability. Geogrid reinforcing fabric is sometimes buried in the backfill behind the wall.
Relevant standards and extra information Standards relevant to retaining walls include:
NZS 3602:2003 Timber and wood-based products for use in building.
NZS 3604:2011 Timber-framed buildings.
NZS 3640:2003 Chemical preservation of round and sawn timber.
NZS 4210:2001 Masonry construction: Materials and workmanship.
NZS 4229:2013 Concrete masonry buildings not requiring specific engineering design.For more information, refer to BRANZ Bulletin 562 Low retaining walls.

Large, double-glazed windows need proper support, particularly when installed beyond the face of the wall framing. Here are some simple tips to help you get it right, the first time
Two challenges created by large, double-glazed units installed beyond the face of the wall framing are:
Ensuring the weight of the window is carried down through supporting elements to the building structure.
Providing support to the sill flashing in direct-fixed cladding situations.
Double-glazed units are supported within the window frame on setting blocks to prevent glass-to-frame contact. They are used in pairs and must be located in accordance with AS/NZS 4666:2012 Insulating glass units , generally at ¼ and ¾ points across the width of the glazing units (see Figure 1a). They may also be located within either ⅛ of the width, or 150 mm from, the glass edge (see Figure 1b).
For direct-fixed claddings, E2/AS1 requires aluminium window frames to be supported on frame support blocks. These may either be fitted to the frame by the manufacturer or be a proprietary product that is installed by the window installer. However, E2/AS1 does not state where the support blocks must be positioned.
Support blocks must be located directly underneath the setting blocks, to ensure the load of the windows is transferred directly to the building structure. In some situations, windows have failed because the support blocks have not been aligned with the setting blocks.
Therefore, before installing the window, confirm the location of the setting blocks and ensure that the support blocks align with them (see Figure 2).
The flat sill tray flashing that is required by E2/AS1 for direct-fixed claddings must also be supported and allow for the installation and support of the frame support blocks.
Typically, the sill tray is supported at least in part by the sill trimmer ( E2/AS1 Figure 72A)and by the top edge of the cladding, where it is accurately trimmed to the opening ( E2/AS1 Figures 81 to 84 for weatherboards and Figure 115 for flat sheet cladding).
A problem can arise where the cladding is not installed accurately and there may be insufficient bearing for the frame support blocks, because of the cladding used and/or the location of the installed window frame; for example, E2/AS1 Figure 90 for fibre-cement weatherboards.
Where this occurs, the options are to install:
A metal angle bracket to the sill trimmer (not a proprietary sill support bar used for cavity construction) to support both the part of the sill tray flashing forward of the framing and the frame support blocks (see Figure 2).
A horizontal metal flat sealed to the sill tray and screwed with a sealed fixing into the upper face of the sill trimmer and projecting forward of the framing line, on which a frame support block can be placed (see Figure 3).
Figure 4 shows the board and batten cladding trimmed to the line of the sill trimmer, with support also provided by the horizontal batten fixed between the vertical battens. Fixing the horizontal batten between the verticals ensures the vertical board joint is fully protected from the weather – if the horizontal board under the sill is continuous and the verticals butted to it, the bottom edge should be undercut or the flashing downturn extended to provide better weathering to the joint.
It is worth noting that installing windows is considered easier where a cladding is installed over a cavity; a proprietary sill support bar can be used in this situation and the sill tray flashing omitted.

If you’ve ever found yourself scratching your head when it comes to suspended floors, this article might be just the help you need
T he following are nine of the most common questions BRANZ’s Technical Helpline receives about designing and building suspended timber floors and dealing with uplift.
1.What’s required to laterally support ends of floor joists?
NZS 3604:2011 has two options for the lateral support at the ends of floor joists for a suspended floor on a pile foundation (see Figure 1a):
A boundary joist 25mm thick and the same depth as the joist.
Solid blocking the same depth as the joist, with individual blocking pieces fixed at 1800mm centres. Blocking needs to be directly above and fixed as required in Table 7.5 to either a bearer connected to subfloor bracing, or a top plate of lower floor braced walls.
Bearer plates attached to a concrete foundation acting as a brace require an 1800mm length of blocking in the line of the foundation wall (see Figure 1b).
2.What lateral support of floor joists is needed under floor diaphragms?
Lateral support to the joists of a floor diaphragm can be provided by:
Full joist height solid blocking between all joists around the perimeter.
A minimum 25mm thick boundary joist at the full depth of the joist around the perimeter.
The potential loads are greater, so NZS 3604:2011 figure 7.9, table 7.5 and clause 7.3 give increased fixing requirements for where the floor acts as a diaphragm.
3.What mid-span lateral support is needed?
Mid-span lateral support is required to be installed:
Within 300mm of subfloor bracing lines (see Figure 2).
To any joist spanning more than 2.5m and with a depth of four or more times its thickness.
This means any floor joist 190×45mm or greater will require blocking when it has a clear span of more than 2.5m.
Often, all the joists for suspended floors will be sized to accommodate the largest spans. In these situations, some of the joists will be larger than required for their spans. If they span less than 2.5m, no mid-span blocking is required (see Figure 1).
Mid-span lateral support can be provided by:
Herringbone strutting (clause 7.1.2.3).
Solid timber the same depth as the joist – solid blocking can be offset 50mm from a centreline at mid-span.
4.What floor support is required below loadbearing walls?
Where spanning joists run parallel to and support loadbearing walls, double up the loadbearing joists (clause 7.1.3.1). The maximum gap allowed between the two joists is half the width of the wall above.
A packer must be installed into the gap at 600mm maximum centres. For example, a 90mm wide frame can have 45mm packers between the loadbearing joists (see Figure 3).
Clause 7.1.3.2 also requires any trimming studs that land on doubled joists to be within 300mm of the end of the span of the doubled joist (see Figure 4).
5.Is support required for non-loadbearing walls parallel to the joists?
Non-loadbearing walls that do not have braced panels and are within 150mm of a floor joist don’t require additional support.
However, 90×45mm blocking on edge (ie, 90mm high) is required to be installed between adjacent joists at each side of door openings (see Figure 5).
Support is required where the non-loadbearing wall contains bracing or is more than 150mm from the joist.
Place 90×45mm blocking on edge between the joists at 1200mm centres and each end of the frame supported. Alternatively, place the wall over a joist.
6.What’s required for cantilevered floor joists?
Table 7.2 has the permitted cantilever lengths. Use the 2kPa (right column) of the table for wet, in-service situations such as balconies with timber slat decking (saddle flashings will be required).
Cantilevered joists require a boundary joist. Joists need to be laterally supported at the point of cantilever (above the supporting wall) with solid blocking to the depth of the joist.
NZS 3604:2011 does not consider cantilevered joists that support external braced walls. This would require specific engineering design.
7.How much can joists be notched and checked?
The maximum check or notch allowed for a joist is 32mm or the depth of the joist divided by five, whichever is less. For example, a 140mm joist could be notched 28mm. The notching or checking can only occur within 450mm of the support (see Figure 6a, 6b, 6c).
NZS 3604:2011 does not permit notching or checking of bearers.
8.What is the minimum height of floors?
The minimum height of a floor is generally driven by the pile height. The tops of piles must be a minimum of 150mm above ground. A protective coating is required to cut ends of timber.
A DPC is required for all concrete piles and for timber pile tops within 300mm of the ground.
The minimum flooring height will be 150mm (for the pile) plus bearer depth plus joist depth.
The type of flooring also needs to be considered. For particleboard, the minimum height from the ground to the underside of the particleboard is 550mm (clause 2.3.7). For treated plywood or solid timber flooring, contact the manufacturer.
9.Are straps required to fix bottom plates to floor joists?
Straps are only required to fix bottom plates to floor joists:
At trimming studs to doors and windows for single-storey buildings.
For the upper floor of multi-floor buildings (see Figure 7).
Bottom plates of non-braced walls require nailing down as set out in Table 7.5 with either:
2/100 × 3.75mm hand-driven nails at 600mm centres maximum into floor joists.
3/gun nails at 600mm centres maximum into floor joists.

Following these 14 steps will ensure a new drain is successfully installed into an existing concrete slab, says BRANZ technical writer David Hindley
W h en a concrete slab on ground for a new house is designed and poured, it should already include all the necessary provisions for drainage and other services.
Where an existing slab needs to be cut for a new waste pipe or drain to be installed, repairing the cut in the right way is crucial for the slab’s strength and resilience.
Relevant Building Code clauses and standards
The work must comply with Building Code clauses and standards, including:
B1 Structure.
B2 Durability (a minimum of 50 years).
G13 Foul water (for wastewater pipes) – compliance can be demonstrated several ways, including through the use of G13/AS2 or G13/AS3 , which reference AS/NZS 3500.2:2021 Plumbing and drainage – Part 2: Sanitary plumbing and drainage.
NZS 3604:2011 Timber-framed buildings section 3 Site requirements and section 7.5 Concrete slab-on-ground floors for timber buildings as modified by B1/AS1.
Involve an architect or engineer
An architect, LBP designer or chartered professional engineer will typically be involved in making the decisions over what is required and how compliance with the Building Code and standards will be demonstrated. They will need to confirm which Acceptable Solution or standard they intend to comply with prior to lodging a Building Consent. For example, they will need to choose G13/AS1 and G13/AS2 or G13/ AS3 ( AS/NZS3500.2 ) as the pathway, as you cannot mix the two solutions.
The engineer may be able to advise on the stability of the slab and the design of the new slab and reinforcing prior to consent. However, this may be best done on a site inspection after the slab has been cut.
Consider whether the physical work of repairing the slab can be carried out by the existing building contractor or whether a specialist should be brought in – the drain laying itself will need to be carried out by a registered drainlayer.
In some cases, proposed drainage plans may show a different option to run drainage without having to cut the slab. However, where this is an option the architect or designer will usually be involved in the decision. The property owner should always be informed of proposed work.
The process
In practical terms, the work is a 14-step process (see Figures 1, 2 and 3):
1. Saw cut the slab and remove the concrete, reinforcing, DPM, insulation and so on.
Take care not to cut or remove the slab perimeter reinforcing bars. If this is not possible, engage an engineer to oversee and instruct the work.
2. Dig out the ground under the slab to the required depth.
Ensure that at least the minimum required falls in the drainage pipe will be achieved. Pipes under a concrete slab complying with G13/AS2 must be laid straight with an even and maximum practicable fall.
3. Prepare bedding for the pipe.
The pipe must be on a minimum 150mm compacted base bedding of sand or other granular material.
4. Lay the drainage pipe to the required falls and backfill over the pipes.
The clearance between the top of the pipe and the underside of the slab must be no less than 25mm under AS/NZS 3500.2:2021 or 50mm under G13/AS2. Where a drain enters or exits from under a building, G13/AS2 says there must be an access point within 2.0m outside the building.
5. Lay sand blinding over the backfilled drains and level it out.
6. Lay DPM such as polythene and tape all the edges.
Forming a waterproof junction between new and existing DPM can be difficult but is crucial for a number of reasons, including avoiding the risk of groundwater entering and corroding the reinforcing steel.
7. Lay insulation over the sand blinding if required.
Figure 1: Plan for a new shower waste
8. It can be useful to scabble out a further 250mm around the existing mesh to support good reinforcing connections.
This is more typically done on commercial projects where engineers may require it. It is often not carried out on smaller residential projects.
9. Drill into the slab edges around the opening to allow placement of new reinforcing bars.
Approximately 50mm (confirm all measurements with the engineer) below the slab surface ( NZS 3604:2011 requires a minimum 30mm cover). Cut starter bars of approximately 400mm long from D12 dowels (or to match existing reinforcing or as an engineer specifies). Place the starters at approximately 150-300mm centres in accordance with the engineer’s instructions.
10. Use epoxy resin (as specified by the engineer) to fix the starters in place usually by injecting it into the holes.
Clean the concrete first by water blasting and using compressed air. Ensure the concrete is dry before installing the epoxy resin, usually a two-part formula, and accurate proportioning and mixing of the constituents is important. Both pot life and curing times are sensitive to temperature. This work should not be carried out below 5°C or above 30°C. Consult the manufacturer for use outside this temperature range.
Once the starters are in place, insert plastic safety end caps on the exposed cut ends to protect from injury while the epoxy resin sets.
11. When the epoxy resin has set, tie the reinforcing bars to the starter bars.
12. Lay new mesh within the opening and tie it to the existing mesh.
13. Prepare to pour the slab to the correct specification
For example, 20MPa. Concrete strength must meet the requirements of NZS 3604:2011 sections 2.6 and 4.5.
14. After pouring, ensure the slab is cured to reduce the risk of cracking.
Note that prior to covering the draining and again prior to pouring the concrete, the BCA may need to carry out inspections before being able to issue a Code Compliance Certificate. It is a good idea to photograph each stage of the works, so you have evidence of exactly what was done, the process and the materials used.

TITLE   : RETROFITTING INSULATION

Tricky access can be a problem when retrofitting insulation into an older home. However, as the push continues to insulate homes, we look at some of the options and things to consider
Houses built before 1978 were not required to be insulated, and some older houses still have no insulation or are only partially insulated. Where insulation has been installed, it often does not meet current Building Code  requirements and is not performing satisfactorily.
Retrofitting insulation into an existing building is not always easy, and options may be limited by accessibility and cost. For example, walls, skillion roofs, low-pitched roofs and some underfloor spaces are hard to access, making installation difficult, and the cost may not be justified.
However, the Healthy Homes Act, which became law on 1 July, 2019 requires a minimum standard for insulation in rental properties.
Building code requirements
The principal Building Code clauses applicable to insulation are clause H1 Energy efficiency, clause E3 Internal moisture and clause B2 Durability.
New building work, such as extensions, must have insulation installed that complies with the requirements of these clauses, while alteration work must comply with the Building Code ‘to at least the same extent as before the alteration’.
In theory, if a new window is inserted into a wall, additional insulation may be required in the wall to offset the reduction in thermal performance as a result of the window installation.
A building consent is required to retrofit insulation into existing external walls, but the installation of underfloor and roof insulation does not require a building consent. This is because the installation of insulation in the walls may have a significant impact on the water management and hence durability of the wall.
Options for installing roof insulation
NZS 4246:2016 Energy efficiency – Installing bulk thermal insulation in residential buildings provides guidance on the methods of installing bulk insulation in light timber-framed and steel-framed buildings and covers both new and existing buildings.
Insulation can be installed, retrofitted or upgraded relatively easily in roof spaces that have good access by either:
Fitting bulk insulation between and over ceiling joists or bottom chords of trusses.
Installing blown-in loose-fill insulation.
Skillion roofs have limited access, so it is not as easy to fit insulation, but it can be installed by:
Removing the roof cladding.
Removing the ceiling lining.
Fixing battens to the underside of the existing ceiling, fitting insulation between the battens and installing a new ceiling lining.
Building a suspended or lowered ceiling into which insulation can be inserted.
Inserting insulation between exposed rafters and installing new ceiling lining over the rafters.
Check recessed downlight ratings
Recessed luminaires – or downlights – are common in ceilings of houses built since the 1980s. Older recessed downlights must not be covered and require a 100mm gap between the downlight and the insulation.
Newer downlights are likely to have a rating classification marked on the fitting. According to the rating, they may:
Be covered with insulation (IC or insulation contact)
Abut insulation (CA or close abutted)
Have no clear marking and require a minimum clearance from both insulation and other building elements in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions or the default clearances given in NZS 4246:2016 and AS/NZS 3000:2007 Electrical installations (see Figure 1).
The same rules apply to the driver units. If the units can be separated from the light, they will be marked as well.
If downlights are being replaced, unmarked fittings must be considered to have a do-not-cover classification and cannot be installed in residential buildings.
Opportunity if replacing linings or cladding
If linings or claddings need to be replaced, it is a good opportunity to install insulation at the same time. There are other options available that don’t require linings to be removed, such as blown-in insulation. BRANZ is currently researching these options and will report on them in the future.
Timber cladding
When replacing external cladding, insulation can be installed between studs from the exterior. Lay new wall underlay over the framing before the new cladding is fixed. The new cladding needs to be installed at the same time as the insulation and underlay is fitted. Otherwise, a suitable protection such as temporary tarpaulins should be provided to protect the insulation until the new cladding is installed.
When replacing internal linings, insulation can also be installed between studs. Check the underlay first and only install if there is underlay and it is in good condition. If there is no underlay or it is in poor condition, there are two methods described in NZS 4246:2016 section 5.4.1 .
BRANZ’s preferred option is installing the insulation with a 20mm minimum gap between the back of the cladding and the insulation to allow for drainage and drying.
Exterior concrete masonry or in situ concrete walls
Insulation options for concrete masonry or in situ concrete walls include:
Installing an Exterior Insulation and Finish System (EIFS) system to the exterior.
Strapping, insulating and lining the internal face of walls.
Suspended timber floors
Where there is good access to the subfloor space, insulation can be fitted between the floor joists. Insulation that is specifically designed for installation under floors includes friction-fitted polystyrene and bulk insulation  blankets or rolls.
Both types must be fitted closely to the underside of the floor, leaving no gap for air movement.
If wind wash is an issue, consider:
Attaching sheet material, such as polythene, hardboard or plywood, to the underside of the joists to protect the insulation.
Using a high-density insulation that is not affected by wind wash.
Putting in extra insulation to compensate (see BRANZ Study Report SR354).
In exposed or wind-wash areas, it’s important to use fixings or strapping to hold the insulation in place. This should follow NZS 4246:2016 or the manufacturer’s instructions.
Reducing heat loss from concrete floor slabs
If renovations are being carried out and there is sufficient internal ceiling height, the existing floor slab may be overlaid with a polythene membrane, 25mm thick polystyrene board and a 75mm minimum thick concrete  topping slab laid over the polystyrene.
The concrete topping slab should also be isolated from the existing timber framing with a damp-proof membrane to prevent moisture from the concrete being absorbed by the timber.
Opportunities to improve perimeter
The perimeter of a concrete slab is even more important for heat loss.
Retrofitting 25mm of extruded polystyrene vertically down the outside of the footing is likely to improve the thermal performance as much as the topping slab insulation.

Brick gable-ended roofs are vulnerable to earthquake damage. This is how builders can reinforce it to help increase the strength of gable-ended roofs
Brick gable-ended roofs should be diagonally braced to prevent out-of-plane movement in an earthquake. It could make the difference between a home that remains liveable and one that does not.
Studies of damage from past New Zealand earthquakes have shown that light timber-framed houses generally perform very well during the challenges of earthquake shaking.
Earthquakes show gable ends vulnerable There are, of course, exceptions to every rule, and we know that certain features in residential construction make some homes more vulnerable to damage. One of those is brick gable-ended roofs. Improving their strength could be the difference between a house being liveable or not following a quake.
Brick gable ends are vulnerable to out-of-plane movement during an earthquake. This is due to a lack of bracing that is particularly common in older homes with framed roofs and unreinforced masonry’s inherent weakness in dealing with tension and high displacements.
Add and secure diagonal braces If diagonal braces aren’t already in place, they should be added to all brick gable ends on a home. Braces typically can run at about a 45–60° angle and at 0.9m to 2m centres from a fixed point along the roof’s height down to the ceiling joists (see Figure 1). Braces should be well secured at each end.
Masonry mechanical tie screws are available and are generally self-tapping for ease of installation. Some can achieve a pull-out resistance of 1kN (100kg) per screw prior to failure.
Mechanical tie screws provide a connection between the timber bracing and the brick during a seismic event. The pull-out capacity of screws should be tested on site and verified as appropriate for the type of brick and the proposed application.
Check load paths Check that the loads being potentially transferred through to the ceiling diaphragm land on a bracing wall. If the horizontal seismic load path does travel through to the brace and ceiling joist, it will need to eventually transfer to the wall framing and foundation system.
NOTE: Details are intended for information purposes. Seek direction from a structural engineer and representative from a masonry repair product supplier as part of any works.

Asbestos can be a serious health hazard – are you prepared to deal with it in a safe manner?
As demolitions ramp up in Christchurch and Auckland, there will be plenty of situations where you encounter asbestos. It is the contractor’s responsibility to check for asbestos and have a plan in place to deal with it.
Asbestos is a health hazard if it is friable – easily crumbled – as airborne fibres can be inhaled and become embedded in the lungs. The inflammation and subsequent scarring of the lung tissue by the asbestos fibres can result in diseases such as asbestosis, lung cancer and mesothelioma. It may take more than 20 years before an asbestos-related disease develops.
Undamaged, non-friable asbestos presents little risk to health. However, when it is damaged as a result of age, weathering, abrasion, waterblasting, chemical or algal attack, or the effects of fire, it is likely to become friable.
Asbestos-containing building materials are likely to have been damaged in the earthquakes and will certainly be damaged during demolition. This means that demolition and construction workers are at significant risk of exposure.
Specialist asbestos removal contractors must hold a certificate of competence that demonstrates they have the knowledge, skills and experience to remove asbestos safely. Most regular contractors are unlikely to have the appropriate knowledge for this task.
Although the Health and Safety in Employment Act 1992 places the responsibility for the safety of employees with the employer, demolition and construction workers must be aware of the dangers of asbestos and know how to manage any risk to themselves and to others.
Before a contractor begins work on a house, they should carry out a simple survey to satisfy themselves they are not at risk of exposure to asbestos. Some questions need asking.
The first indicator as to whether asbestos is likely to be present or not is the age of the house. Asbestos and asbestos-containing materials (ACMs) were very widely used in the building industry from the late 1930s until around 1990.
Many materials in buildings built or renovated during this period are likely to contain asbestos (see Figure 1). External materials containing asbestos may include corrugated Super Six roofing, guttering, downpipes and rainwater heads, asbestos-cement soffit linings, external wall claddings such as asbestos-cement sheets and shingles, imitation brick and stone claddings and stucco plaster over asbestos-cement sheet.
Interior finishes and materials may include stippled and textured ceilings, suspended ceiling tiles, the backing to vinyl and linoleum sheet and tile flooring, the lining board behind a gas heater or a fuse board, hot water pipe and cylinder lagging, and insulation.
Flues, metal flue joint and wood burner seals and night-store heaters may all contain asbestos. Asbestos was also sometimes added to plasterboard and plasterboard jointing compound, and lathe and plaster skim coats have been found to contain asbestos.
If the answer is ‘no’ to both these questions – ‘Was the building built or renovated between 1940  and 1990?’ and ‘Is there any other evidence of asbestos?’ – then no further assessment is required and repair or demolition work can begin. If the answer is ‘yes’ to either question, a more detailed survey should be carried out.
A more detailed survey should include:
Drawing a simple floor plan.
Identifying all rooms and spaces on the plan.
Working through a checklist to identify locations in the house where there may be asbestos.
Recording all locations where asbestos might be present on the floor plan.
Be systematic when carrying out the building survey and document all results on the checklist (see Table 1).
The only way to know for sure whether a material contains asbestos is to have samples tested at an IANZ-accredited laboratory. Samples must be taken by a person competent to work in asbestos-hazard conditions, without risk to their own or others’ health and safety. They should know:
The types and applications of ACMs.
The correct use, maintenance and storage of personal protective equipment (PPE).
The hazards of asbestos exposure.
The safe use of plant and equipment to be used.
When taking samples, it’s important to:
Be methodical.
Take several samples in each location.
Identify and record the location of each sample.
Store samples from different locations separately.
By carrying out a survey and treating any suspected material as if it contains asbestos, the contractor minimises any exposure risk to themselves and to others.
If you think asbestos is present, act as if it is.
Do not assume that a material does not contain asbestos.
If asbestos is found in one part of a building, it is likely to be in similar materials in other parts of the building.

Penetrations are often required through suspended concrete floors – though not without careful planning!
While the concrete ground floor slab is a common feature in New Zealand homes, suspended concrete floors have been slower to catch on outside commercial and architecturally designed homes. However, suspended concrete floors offer many benefits for residential buildings, including excellent structural performance, thermal advantages and sound dampening.
Penetrations are often required through floor slabs for various reasons, most commonly for services or access. This CCANZ article offers guidance on drilling, cutting or forming holes in concrete floor slabs.
Where penetrations are detailed on the structural drawings, the engineer will have allowed for them in the design and they will not constitute a problem. When penetrations that are not detailed on the structural drawings are formed or cut through a suspended floor slab, they need proper consideration. Moreover, penetrations which differ from those specified on the structural drawings – either through size or location – must be checked by the engineer responsible before being formed.
“Penetrations cut or formed through a suspended floor slab can seriously affect its structural capacity by reducing its bending or shear strength or both
Penetrations cut or formed through a suspended floor slab can seriously affect its structural capacity by reducing its bending or shear strength, or both. It is easy for one small hole to cut through a critical piece of reinforcing or to remove a section of concrete essential to the shear capacity. It is imperative that specialist advice is obtained prior to forming or cutting a penetration through a suspended floor where the penetration is not detailed on the structural drawings.
It is relatively simple to design a suspended floor to allow a number of penetrations to be cut after construction with limits on the size, location and spacing. This is done by providing additional reinforcing to ensure sufficient strength remains despite the loss of some capacity if reinforcing is cut.
Limits on size, location and spacing of penetrations must be carefully specified in the design and adhered to by the constructor. This may involve only a small additional cost that is outweighed by the convenience, flexibility and by not having to obtain further approvals.
No penetrations should be cut or formed through a floor slab unless they are either detailed on the structural drawings, or specific written approval has been obtained from the person responsible for the structural design of the floor prior to forming them.
Issues to be considered when forming penetrations through floors include the effect on:
Bending capacity.
Shear capacity, both vertical and horizontal (diaphragm action).
Reinforcing cover.
Fire ratings or fire spread.
Acoustic separation.
Additional protection required for outdoor or harsh environments.
Each item may require input from an appropriately qualified professional. The person responsible for structural design may only be able to comment on the first three of these considerations.
Prior to placing in-situ concrete on site, designers will determine the effect of proposed penetrations on the structural adequacy of the completed floor. For cast in-situ reinforced, post tensioned, or metal decking floors, it is relatively easy, compared with precast elements, to identify the critical reinforcing. Thus the penetrations can be located so they will not affect the structural capacity of the completed floor or compromise the integrity of the reinforcing through reduced cover. Alternatively, additional reinforcing or supports can be provided.
While floor slabs are generally located on the interior of a structure, special consideration needs to be given when making penetrations that reduce concrete cover in horizontal slabs which are exposed to the external environment. Where penetrations are needed, even in internal environments, specialist advice should be sought to determine if alternative corrosion protection is required, such as galvanizing or epoxy coating of the embedded reinforcement.
For rib and infill floors, the critical reinforcing is normally contained within the rib and designers can locate penetrations in non-critical areas. Large penetrations between the ribs can reduce the bending capacity if they leave an insufficient compression zone. For floors incorporating precast double tees and precast single tees, it is also relatively simple for designers to locate penetrations in non-critical areas away from the tee down stand. However, the effect of large penetrations on bending capacity, through reduction of the compression zone, requires consideration.
The critical reinforcing in pre-stressed flat slab floors can be seen at the ends of the precast units. With hollowcore floor units the reinforcing can be seen at the ends of the units. Generally the vertical webs should remain intact and penetrations should not be drilled or cut that affect the vertical webs. Penetrations must not compromise pre-stressing strands.
Next month we’ll focus on penetrations once in-situ concrete is in place.

Penetrations are often required through suspended concrete floor slabs – though not without careful planning!
While the concrete ground floor slab is a common feature in New Zealand homes, suspended concrete floors have been slower to catch on outside commercial and architecturally designed homes.
However, suspended concrete floors offer many benefits for residential buildings, including excellent structural performance, thermal advantages and sound dampening.
Penetrations are often required through floor slabs for various reasons, most commonly for services or access. This CCANZ article offers guidance on drilling, cutting or forming holes in concrete floor slabs.
It is far more preferable to plan and make penetrations as part of the design of the floor prior to placing in-situ concrete – whether the in-situ concrete is topping over the precast elements or the floor itself. This is because the effects of cutting critical reinforcement or compromising stressing strands can render the floor unsafe, and must be fully appreciated at the installation stage.
Once the in-situ concrete is in place, it is very difficult to determine the location of critical reinforcing in the floor slab.
For cast in-situ reinforced or post-tensioned floors, the original structural drawings will give an indication of the reinforcing size and spacing but cannot be relied upon to give the precise location. The effect of cutting or damage to reinforcing depends on its location. It is unlikely that any damage to post tension ducts would be acceptable.
“It is far more preferable to plan an make penetrations as part of the design of the floor prior to placing in-situ concrete
Rib and infill floors, and floors incorporating precast tees, should be examined from the exposed underside before any decision is made (by the engineer) regarding cutting penetrations.
Determining the precise location of critical reinforcing in precast flat slabs and hollowcore units is more difficult. The manufacturer of the precast units may be able to give some guidance but may not be able to give accurate locations.
If possible, the infill sections between spaced hollowcore units are a more suitable location to accommodate penetrations and services than the units themselves.
“There are penetrations in completed floors that do not directly affect floor reinforcement but can still be a problem
Holes should not be cut through existing floors incorporating precast units without consulting the original supplier (where known), or a specialist with expertise in precast floor units.
Drilling contractors should stop drilling or cutting where they encounter reinforcing steel. Structural engineering advice should be sought and, if permitted to proceed, written confirmation should also be obtained.
Penetrations are sometimes required as part of the floor installation but are not detailed as part of the design – for example, hollowcore floor units that need to be cut to accommodate perimeter columns. This should be referred back to the engineer for advice before installation.
There are penetrations in completed floors that do not directly affect floor reinforcement but can still be a problem. These must be considered by the design engineer before being made. Some examples are:
Horizontal penetrations through ribs and single/double-tee downstands, which affect both the shear and flexural capacity of the support.
Horizontal penetrations across the hollow cores of floors, which could initiate a premature shear failure.
Penetrations that reduce seating of precast units.
Multiple small penetrations along diaphragm connections to perimeter frames or walls.
In addition to penetrations in suspended concrete floors and slabs, penetrations are sometimes required in beams, columns and walls.
As these elements usually form the main structural system in a building, such penetrations must, in general, only be formed when they are shown on the design drawings and have been specified by the structural engineer responsible. Penetrations not shown on the design drawings must not be made without the specific permission, in writing, of the structural engineer responsible.

Getting flashings right between a tight area such as the main gable of a building and the ridge of a smaller gable can be difficult. With these installation pointers, you can ensure this junction is weathertight
C orrectly installed flashings are essential to ensuring weather tightness, but in some locations, detailing and installation can be tricky. This is when it is necessary to achieve a detail that keeps out moisture, meets the requirements of Acceptable Solution E2/AS1 and is also durable and aesthetically pleasing.
One such detail is the junction between the main gable of a building and the ridge from a smaller gable, often a garage (see Figure 1).
Sequence of assembly – no eave
The sequence of assembly of flashing such a junction is critical to achieving a weathertight detail. Figures 2a – 2c show the sequence for flashing the junction between the gable and ridge where there is no eave. Figure 3 shows the shapes of each of the flashings and how they should be folded.
Step 1: Flashing 1 is a typical apron roof flashing. The flashing upstand is carried up under the cladding and wall underlay and the flashing apron is extended over the ridge of the smaller gable (see Figure 2a).
Step 2: Flashing 2 covers both the apron flashing upstand and the wall underlay. It is folded over the large gable roof and the apron flashing and also extended over the ridge of the smaller gable (see Figure 2b).
Step 3: Fit a butyl rubber patch over flashing 2 (see Figure 2b).
Step 4: A ridge flashing is fitted over the smaller gable ridge butting up to the wall cladding, and the bargeboard is installed over the ridge.
Flashing 3 is a standard barge flashing that, on the large gable roof, extends beyond the ridgeline of the smaller gable and aligns with the bottom edge of the ridge flashing (see Figure 2c).
Roof junction with an eave
Where there is an eave at the junction between the two gables, the apron and barge flashings are fitted in the same way. However, an undersoaker flashing is required over the soffit, apron flashing and roof (see Figure 4).

Correctly stabilising wing walls in wet areas such as bathrooms is important to ensure the waterproofing membrane is not compromised. Architect Bruce Sedcole shares tips on how to mitigate this issue
R ecent callers to the BRANZ helpline have highlighted that there are more frequent requests for information from building consent authorities about the stability of internal wing walls – specifically walls that are not full stud height, and especially those located in wet areas.
Often near bathtubs or showers
These wing walls are often used in residential bathrooms and usually located adjacent to built-in bathtubs or shower enclosures. As the walls are not full height, they do not contribute structurally to loadbearing capacity or lateral bracing. They function primarily as a privacy screen or a surface to mount fixtures and fitments, such as tapware and shower screens or doors.
Located in wet areas and often near to, or at, the water source, they usually become part and parcel of the waterproofing system in these spaces. If the wing wall is finished in tiles – to match adjacent walls or floor – they may also be a vulnerable point of potential compromise of the waterproofing membrane, especially at junctions.
Deal with the top of the panel first
To stiffen internal wing walls, there are several options that need consideration.
The primary goal is to stabilise the unrestrained top corner of the wall and to eliminate any wobble or flex in the wall panel.
The first question is: how do we stiffen or constrain this free top corner of the panel ?
There are a variety of methods. The rudimentary solutions involve connecting the free corner with a post to the ceiling above or with a horizontal connection rail – such as via a framed shower screen panel or door – to an adjacent wall.
However, while these may perform the required structural task, they often don’t meet the aesthetic expectations of either the designer or the client. To eliminate these potentially visually intrusive solutions requires a little more planning.
Wider timber framing for the wing wall
In my own architectural practice, we generally use wider timber wall framing to the wing wall – increasing the framing timber up to 140mm or even 190mm thickness. Tightly securing the bottom plate to the floor with staggered fixings – on either side of the longitudinal centre line – helps mitigate the possibility of the wall rocking.
We also generally forgo nail fixings from bottom plate to floor and tend to specify threaded fixings, such as coach screws, coach bolts or cast-in threaded anchors to reinforced concrete floor slabs.
Line the wing wall with rigid material
It is also helpful to use a strong, rigid lining material to the surface of the wing wall. Plasterboard linings – even if rated for wet area use – may still flex, potentially enough to compromise the performance of the waterproofing membrane system. It is far safer to use a strong inert substrate, such as a high-performing fibre-cement sheet lining, finished for internal use and installed in strict accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions.
In this situation, adhesive alone should not be relied on to attach the sheet lining. Instead, combine adhesive with a mechanical fastening system to ensure there is sufficient strength to hold the board, the weight of any applied tiles and any occasional additional lateral load that may occur.
However, even with these beefed-up specs for the construction of the wing wall, it is still prudent to install additional bracing that will resist any extra lateral loads that may be applied to the unrestrained top corner of the wing wall.
Utilising a bracket system
Over the years, my architectural practice has adopted a simple bracket system to stiffen the entire top edge of the wing wall (see Figure 1). We use a flat metal plate – usually aluminium – that has the same area and dimensions as the top edge of the wing wall framing, but is lengthened to extend into the wall cavity of the adjacent full stud height wall it abuts.
The plate is usually fixed to the top plate of the wing wall with countersunk screws, with another piece of the wall lining then fixed over it to receive tiles or a finishing coat.
To my knowledge, however, there are no off-the-shelf Acceptable Solution answers to this method. As there are several variables, we use a registered engineer to calculate the specific loads on the wall, design each bracket and issue a producer statement for the building consent application.
A solution from the States
There are other solutions available online that I have not seen used in Aotearoa New Zealand, but may be adaptable for use here. In the USA, these non-full-height walls are referred to as half walls, knee walls or sometimes even pony walls.
There, the common solution to making these wing walls sturdier on suspended timber floors is to create a vertical cantilever with the wall. Each wall stud is continued straight down through the floor, alongside each joist or trimmer, or blocking as required, and attached to the subfloor or floor framing.
This means opening up the floor from above in alterations to existing construction, but the online instruction videos make it look fairly straightforward. Care would be required with both framing and waterproof membrane application detailing, but this appears to be a robust, time-tested solution.
Feedback welcome
I am keen to hear feedback from readers regarding any other methods that may have been successfully used to stabilise these walls – not only on suspended timber floors, but also reinforced concrete floor slabs and especially existing floors. You can contact me at bruce.sedcole@branz.co.nz .

Ground conditions are a factor in building developments and must be assessed for any potential risk. To identify, mitigate and avoid problems, it makes good sense to hire a geotechnical professional for advice on site selection and development
It is critical to any building development, whether an addition to an existing house, a new house build or a multi-storey building, to consider the ground conditions of the site and any risks they may present.
GROUND CONDITIONS INFLUENCE SITE SELECTION
Ground conditions can influence the selection of the site and the layout and form (shape and size) of buildings built on it. Often an architect or structural engineer is appointed to look at the feasibility and concept design of a project. They will be responsible for identifying where the ground conditions present a risk and for recommending a geotechnical professional.
It is wise to engage a geotechnical professional at the beginning of a project to advise on ground conditions and the constraints that these impose on the development.
RISKY GROUND CONDITIONS
We often see damage to buildings in New Zealand from poor ground conditions. These could have largely been avoided with early geotechnical advice that had been taken and acted on.
Fills Settlement of fill is a common problem that can continue to occur years after the fill was placed – either because it was poorly compacted, or because its weight compresses the underlying natural ground. Fills also frequently perform poorly under earthquake shaking.
Expansive soils Auckland, Northland and other parts of New Zealand have soils prone to shrink swell. The drying effect of the summer months, or of trees, causes the soil to shrink. Any houses sitting above them will settle, causing jamming doors and cracked plaster. In some cases, dry soils can swell upon wetting and cause similar damage.
Peats and organics Peats can be hidden beneath the surface and are common in low-lying and coastal areas around New Zealand. Earthworks filling of only a few hundred millimetres can trigger these peats to settle, and this can continue for years.
Settling ground dragging down piles A common foundation solution for buildings over ground prone to settlement is to drive or bore piles down to solid ground, although this alone may not solve the problem. As the ground settles around the piles, it can drag them down, causing the building to settle.
A geotechnical engineer will design piles that specifically allow for these drag-down effects.
Ground settling around piles Settling ground presents another common issue with piled foundations. The ground around the building will continue to settle, causing many problems around the perimeter of the building, such as broken pipes and separation of entrance steps. This settlement potential must be identified and connection details developed to allow for it.
Liquefaction While we all saw the effects of liquefaction in Christchurch, unfortunately, the risk of liquefaction is by no means limited to that city. Councils have hazard maps identifying areas prone to liquefaction, but these are an indication of risk only. It would be prudent to have the map interpreted and the site investigated by a geotechnical engineer or engineering geologist.
Slope instability and creep If not properly designed and formed, cut and fill slopes can slip or creep, resulting in damage to land and buildings. Steep temporary cut and fill slopes formed during construction can be particularly hazardous. Depending on the geology, natural slopes can be prone to creep, even on gentle gradients. Extreme rain or earthquake events can trigger slips. Engineering geologists are trained to identify potential slope hazards by studying the geology and the contour of the site’s surface (geomorphology).
Erosion Coastal and river erosion can damage land and undermine buildings. Depending on the geology, land can be prone to surface erosion or even erosion beneath the surface. This subsurface erosion can form tomos (sinkholes) and voids, resulting in subsidence (surface slumping). Underground mining can produce a similar hazard.
Other geohazards Other geotechnical hazards to be considered include variable and/or weak ground conditions, falling debris, ground rupture due to earthquake faulting and deflection of retaining walls.
PROJECT STAGES AND GROUND CONDITIONS
Geotechnical advice is likely to be required throughout a building development and particularly early in the project when any constraints on development that are identified can be most efficiently addressed.
The project stages of inception, design and construction are listed below, along with the associated geotechnical advice.
Inception This is where the site is selected and the layout and form of a building development is decided. It is important to understand the geotechnical hazards and the constraints these may impose at this stage. In the case of a recent subdivision, there may be an existing geotechnical report providing this information.
There may be covenants on the site’s certificate of title imposing building restriction lines or other means of applying constraints to avoid geotechnical hazards. If such information is not available, a geotechnical professional should undertake an assessment.
That professional is likely to undertake a desktop study and site inspection, plus possibly some physical investigations. The desktop study could include review of aerial photographs, geological maps and available geotechnical data. It may include discussions with locals to understand the site history.
From this initial study, the geotechnical professional can identify geotechnical issues and work with the client, architect and structural engineer to develop a concept for the building development. A geotechnical report may be needed in support of any resource consent application required.
Design During the development of the design, the level of involvement by the geotechnical professional varies depending on the complexity of the project and of any geotechnical issues to be resolved. A geotechnical report and associated producer statement design (PS1) may be required in support of the building consent application.
Construction It is important during construction of any foundations that inspections and testing of the ground is undertaken to verify the assumptions made during design. A producer statement construction review (PS4) is likely to be required to support the application for Code compliance. Depending on the complexity of the project, geotechnical issues and requirements of the council, this PS4 and associated construction observations may require a geotechnical professional.
WHO ARE GEOTECHNICAL PROFESSIONALS?
Geotechnical professionals include engineering geologists and geotechnical engineers, who normally work together. The engineering geologist focuses on geology and identifying the ground hazards while the geotechnical engineer focuses more on the consequences of these hazards for the development and how they can be mitigated.
There is a lot of overlap between these two professions and either can lead the assessment and mitigation of geotechnical hazards. It is recommended that either a professional engineering geologist (PEngGeol) or a chartered professional engineer (CPEng) with a practice field of geotechnical be engaged to lead the geotechnical work.
Sources for geotechnical advice The following is a list of sources for advice on resolving geotechnical issues for a building development.
NZS 3604:2011 Timber-framed buildings provides standard design details for timber-framed buildings (including their foundations) for compliance with the Building Code. Its intended audience is builders, architects and engineers. These foundation details only apply for specific types of buildings and only when it can be shown that the foundations will be on ‘good ground’, which is defined in the document. For other types of buildings and where good ground is not present, specific design by an engineer is required.
AS 2870-2011 Residential slabs and footings . If the soils are prone to shrink swell and not good ground as defined in NZS 3604:2011 , building designers are referred to AS 2870-2011 , which requires the use of a shrink swell test. Unfortunately, this test has proven to be unreliable for use on soils in Auckland and Northland. In these areas do liquid limit and linear shrinkage tests as set out in NZS 3604:2011 .
If the results show the soil is not ‘good ground’ because of expansivity, determine the Plasticity Index (by doing a plastic limit test) and the percent clay. Provide this information to an experienced geotechnical engineer, who can look at the site context and provide specific foundation advice.
NZS 4404:2010 Land development and subdivision infrastructure sets out the requirements for design of infrastructure for land development and subdivisions, when involvement of a geotechnical professional is required and the scope of that involvement through design and construction.
NZS 4431:1989 Code of practice for earth fill for residential development describes earth fill practices to produce fills of satisfactory stability for residential development. It sets out when a geotechnical professional is required and the scope of that involvement through design and construction.
Planning and engineering guidance for potentially liquefaction-prone land, 2017, published by MBIE, provides guidance for risk-based assessment of liquefaction for development of regional and district plans, and resource and building consent assessments.
Earthquake geotechnical engineering practice modules, 2017, New Zealand Geotechnical Society. This series of six modules provides geotechnical engineers with guidance on investigation and design allowing for earthquakes.

The pressure is on these days to get houses finished as quickly as possible. There can be big problems, though, if you put fixed floor coverings or membranes onto a slab before it is sufficiently dry. So, how can you tell when a slab is dry enough?
It’s not unusual for tiles, timber or vinyl flooring or waterproof membranes to be installed or applied to concrete slabs before the slabs are properly dry. The result can be bubbles forming and adhesion failing under vinyl sheet flooring, warping/rot in solid timber / timber composite overlay flooring, cracking in floor tiles, mould under loose-laid carpet – all expensive headaches.
Building Code Acceptable Solution E2/ AS1 says that concrete floors should have a relative humidity reading of less than 75% at the time of laying fixed floor coverings . NZS AS 1884:2013 Floor coverings – Resilient sheet and tiles – Installation practices requires the relative humidity to be 75% or less.
These are upper limits:
Some flooring manufacturers require a maximum relative humidity figure below 75%.
Because of the sensitivity of timber or wood-based flooring products to moisture, a maximum 70% relative humidity for timber floors is considered prudent.
A typical 100mm thick slab can take four months or longer to get to 75% relative humidity. A slab only begins to dry properly once the building is weathertight. Drying will be slower where there are lower air temperatures, higher humidity or little ventilation.
Using dehumidifiers, fans or heaters to try to dry the slab faster doesn’t work, as they only dry the surface.
Sometimes there is confusion between drying and curing – they are not the same. Curing is the chemical reaction that takes place when all the ingredients of concrete become bonded together, drying is where surplus water evaporates from a slab.
Drying normally takes much longer than curing. The amount of water needed to activate the chemical curing process is quite small. Most of the water in the concrete is there to allow it to be mixed, pumped and placed, and it is this water that must be allowed to evaporate from the slab.
Testing for humidity
E2/AS1 refers to testing with a hygrometer, while NZS AS 1884:2013 also covers humidity probes. Most hygrometers today give an electronic readout.
Hygrometers have an insulated box that must be sealed to the slab. Water vapour coming out of the concrete enters an opening in the bottom of the box – after 16 to 32 hours, the water vapour pressure in the box equals that in the floor and the relative humidity is shown.
More details on the process can be found in BRANZ Bulletin 585 Measuring moisture in timber and concrete.
Humidity probes are either embedded in the slab when the concrete is poured or inserted into a hole drilled in the slab. Probes may be more reliable than hygrometers, because the relative humidity is measured in the body of the concrete, not at the surface.
Several measurements should be made at different points in the slab – a single spot test isn’t good enough.
Once the slab is dry enough to lay flooring, let the flooring acclimatise in the space, so it is at the same temperature and moisture level as the room.
Open packets of timber or wood-based flooring and stack it, so air circulates around it. Let timber and wood-based flooring acclimatise for at least two days – some manufacturers may specify three days. Ideally, roll out vinyl flooring and leave it for two days so it can relax and reach room temperature.

BRANZ continues to improve its maintenance schedule service
BRANZ’s new maintenance schedule workspace is designed to save builders time thanks to features that make it easier and quicker to use.
Users can now manage volumes of schedules and save, sort and share them within their own personal workspace. The enhanced, easy-to-use features include the ability to:
Sort and save schedules alphabetically by schedule name or client name.
Add notes to each schedule.
Include a practical completion date.
Send and share your schedules to other users within the tool.
Save schedules as a favourite when building spec homes and produce copies of favourites for future builds.
Maintenance info is mandatory
According to consumer protection measures, once the building work is completed, you must give clients information about the processes and materials to be used to maintain the building work. This is mandatory regardless of the price of the work. It is particularly important if maintenance:
Is required to meet the requirements of the Building Code.
Could affect any guarantee or warranty.
This is an additional requirement over and above any maintenance information supporting a consent application.
You could be fined if you don’t provide this information, so make sure to provide clients with a detailed maintenance schedule report at the end of the build.
For more information, see here: www.maintenanceschedules.co.nz

Sometimes you need to make up a specified timber size from narrower timber – read up on the rules below
This article focuses on using built-up members in place of solid timber. This is becoming more and more common with fabricated products, but it may pay to know that it can be done on site too.
This article provides some basic guidance on the subject, and you’ll be able to find more detailed information in NZS 3604:2011.
Jack studs, and bottom and top plates must always be solid timber members but Timber-framed buildings NZS 3604:2011 does allow other solid timber members to be replaced by built-up members. A built-up member is two or more component members used to make one larger member. However, there are a few rules that must be followed when using built-up members. The built-up members must:
Be the same grade of timber.
Be in one continuous length.
Match or exceed the size of the solid member required in accordance with NZS 3604:2011. Built-up members may consist of up to six component members and must be nailed together according to the nailing requirements described in NZS 3604:2011.
Built-up members of up to three components
The nailing requirements for built-up members of up to three components are that:
The spacing of the nails is no more than six times the thickness of the thinnest component.
All nails penetrate at least three-quarters of the last component member.
Nails are driven from alternate sides of the built-up member.
For example, a built-up member consisting of two 90 x 35mm and one 90 x 20mm components must have:
Nailing spacings at 120mm centres maximum (6 x 20mm = 120mm where 20mm is the thinnest component member).
Nails that are at least 82mm long (35mm + 20mm + (0.75 x 35mm) = 82mm) (Figure 1).
When members are 140mm or more in width, at least two rows of nails are required but the other criteria remain the same (Figure 2).
Built-up members of over three components
Where the built-up member consists of more than three component members, the first three component members should be assembled in the same way as a built-up member with up to three components. Additional component members are then fixed using nails that are twice as long and spaced at six times the thickness of each component member added (Figure 3).

Bevel-back weatherboards are back in vogue, but there’s a lack of experienced installers. This has led to some poor installations, so here are the key pointers to getting it right
B evel-back timber weatherboards have been used on New Zealand buildings for more than 150 years. The first boards were simply square inch-thick planks that were installed horizontally, with the upper board overlapping the lower.
In the intervening years, the boards acquired the profile we see today, but in essence, they have changed very little.
Return of bevel-back weatherboards
As is common with many claddings, there have been periods when the bevel-back timber weatherboard was popular, like the 1920s (see Figure 1) and 1940–50s, before fading from popularity.
Since the leaky building crisis, there has been a marked resurgence in the popularity of bevel-back timber weatherboards, particularly when installed over a drained and vented cavity.
Inexperience leads to poor installation
This resurgence has highlighted a shortage of tradespeople experienced in bevel-back timber weatherboard installation. Recent issues with installation include:
Not effectively sealing cut ends, notches and holes in boards.
Double nailing of timber boards.
Poor-quality cutting of mitres to external corners and omitting soakers or backflashings or mitre joints opening up as a result of timber movement.
Incorrect installation sequence at internal corners.
Sealing of the board laps – this is not recommended as it restricts drainage and drying.
The correct method
Figure 2 gives the correct fixing location. This is a single nail to each board located just above the lap.
Guidance for the installation of timber weatherboards is given in E2/AS1 section 9.4 and in the following BRANZ publications:
Good Practice Guide: Timber Cladding (3rd edition)
House Building Guide (3rd edition)

With summer fast approaching, now is a good time to brush up on your deck building skills, as homeowners prepare for long evenings spent around the BBQ
A n Acceptable Solution for deck construction is provided by NZS 3604:2011Timber-framed buildings . In this article, we’ll show you how to design and build an external open-slatted timber deck.
An L-shaped deck addition is proposed or an existing house. It will be 6.3m long in one direction, project 3.0m from the face of building and have a total area of 21m² (see Figure 1). The finished deck level will be 100mm below the floor level of the house.
The requirements of foundations, subfloor framing, bracing, decking selection, fastenings and fixings can be found in NZS 3604 section 7.4.
The house is in earthquake zone 3 ( NZS 3604 Figure 5.4 ). As there is no subsoil classification, E must be assumed and a multiplication factor of 1.0 ( NZS 3604 clause 5.3.3 and Table 5.8 ) used for bracing calculations.
The section slopes away from the house, starting at approximately 1.0m below floor level adjacent to the house to approximately 2.0m below floor level at the edge of the deck. Joists are to be cantilevered 900mm beyond the line of the piles and bearer (see Figure 1).
The building owner would like to use a 32mm Kwila decking, so joist spacing may be up to 600mm. However, as the deck is to support a cantilevered balustrade, NZS 3604 clause 7.4.1.3 requires that joists must be at 400 centres maximum and at least 190mm deep.
New Zealand Building Code clause B2 Durability sets out the durability requirements for building elements and cites NZS 3602:2003 Timber and wood-based products for use in building for timber treatment levels.
Generally, structural elements must have not less than 50-year durability, and stairs, handrails and decking require not less than 15-year durability. All structural fixings must have the same durability as the elements with which they are associated and will need to be stainless steel.
So, from NZS 3602: Table 1:
Piles must be H5 treated (ground contact).
All other structural members – ie, bearers, stringer, braces, joists and safety barrier support posts –must be at least H3.2 treated (exposed to the exterior but not in ground contact).
NZS 3604 clause 2.3.2 requires SG8 (structural grade) timber for wet-in-service conditions.
Using the multiplication factor E for zone 3 = 1.0
15 BU/m² × 1.0 = 15 BU/m²
Paragraph 7.4.2.2 states that decks that project more than 2.0m from the building require subfloor bracing at half the bracing demand required by Table 5.8 for ‘light/light/light’ cladding, 0° roof pitch and for ‘subfloor structures’. Divide the number of BUs required by two:
15 BU/m² / 2 = 7.5 BU/m² are required.
Multiply the number of BU/m2 by the area of the deck to obtain the total BUs required for the deck:
7.5 BU/m² × 21m² = 157.5 BUs in each direction.
Bracing may be provided by anchor, braced and cantilevered piles. NZS 3604 section 6 Brace pile gives the bracing capacity ratings of subfloor bracing elements. Both anchor and braced piles provide 120 BUs per bracing element.
However, as anchor piles may only be 600mm above ground level, and the ground level is 1.0–2.0m below the deck, anchor piles cannot be used.
Similarly, cantilevered piles may only extend 1.2m maximum above ground level and in addition provide only 30 BUs per pile, requiring more cantilevered piles to achieve the BUs needed.
Braced pile systems offer the best solution. As they provide 120 BUs for earthquake resistance, two braced pile systems are required in each direction.
Braces will be less than 3.0m long, so the brace size may be 100 × 75mm.
As the line of support (ie, piles and bearer) is 2.1m from the house, according to NZS 3604 Table 7.1(b) (2 kPa floor load and wet in service), 140 × 45mm joists may be used, and Table 7.2 for cantilevered joists allows a cantilever of up to 1150mm.
However, at the bottom of Table 7.2, a note states that 140mm joist depth is insufficient where cantilevered balustrades are to be used (as in this situation). So, select the next size up: 190 × 45mm joists. At 400 centres, these may cantilever up to 1600mm.
Select bearers from NZS 3604 Table 6.4 (b) (2 kPa floor load and wet in service). To determine the loaded dimension of the bearers, refer to NZS 3604 Definitions.
From Figure 1.3(G), the loaded dimension = (span 1/2) + span 2 (where span 1 = 2.1m and span 2 = 900mm) = 2.1/2 + 900 = 1.95m
From NZS 3604 Table 6.4(b) (2 kPa floor load and wet in service):
For maximum bearer span = 1.3 and a loaded dimension of 2.3m, bearer = 140 × 70mm, or
For maximum bearer span = 1.65 and loaded dimension 2.7m, bearer = 190 × 70mm.
Use 140 × 70mm bearers with supports at 1.3m centres maximum.
Stringers will be used against the house. Ideally, stringers should be packed off and fixed to the foundation wall. Maximum joist span is 2.1m, so from NZS 3604 Table 6.5 , the stringer may be either:
140 × 45mm
190 × 45mm
Both will need bolt fixings at 1600mm centres.
A combination of ordinary and braced piles must be used. Select 140mm diameter timber piles.
For pile footings, use NZS 3604 Table 6.1.
For ordinary piles:
Maximum bearer span = 1.3m; maximum joist span = 2.1m.
Footings – 260mm diameter, 200mm minimum deep ( NZS 3604 Figure 6.2 ).
For braced piles:
Two systems in each direction.
Footings – 400mm diameter, 450mm minimum deep ( NZS 3604 clause 6.8.1.1 ).
When installing slatted timber decking, leave:
A 12mm minimum gap between the stringer and the decking.
A 12mm minimum gap between the cladding and the decking for drainage (E2/AS1 paragraph 7.1.1) – see Figures 3 and 4.
A 3–6mm gap between decking timbers lengthways ( NZS 3604 recommends using a 100 × 3.75mm nail as a spacer) to allow timber movement due to moisture and temperature changes and for water to drain.

The larger shank diameter of fixings used for weatherboards fitted over a cavity can cause splitting. One way to get around this problem is to fix timber cavity battens directly to the structural framing
B uilding code acceptable solution E2/AS1 clause 9.1.8.4(c) says that cavity battens must be fixed to the structural frame by the cladding fixing. Table 24 gives methods of fixing different claddings. The table includes fixing types and sizes, minimum frame penetrations for fixings and fixing patterns.
Minimum penetrations required
The minimum penetration length of fixings into the frame for particular claddings is the same whether the cladding is direct-fixed or over a cavity.
Fixings for paint-finish weatherboards must have a minimum penetration of 35mm into the structural frame.
Fixings for stained or bare finish weatherboards must have a minimum penetration of 30mm into the structural frame.
When weatherboards are fixed over a cavity, fixings must be at least 20mm longer to achieve the minimum penetration into the structural frame.
As a general rule, as the nail length increases there is also an increase in shank diameter.
This can cause the weatherboards to split.
Solution – structurally fix cavity battens to framing
One way to overcome this potential splitting problem is to fix the timber cavity battens directly to the framing.
The battens then become part of the structural frame, which allows the fixings given in Table 24 to be used.
Although this is an alternative method, the structural integrity of this fixing arrangement was confirmed by BRANZ Test Report ST0589 Version 2 Fixing horizontal weatherboards to studs over a cavity . It is described in BRANZ Bulletin 582 Structurally fixed cavity battens.
Rusticated and bevelback weatherboards
BRANZ Bulletin 582 states that, to fix horizontal rusticated and bevel-back weatherboards, timber battens must:
Have a maximum thickness of 20mm.
Be at least 40mm wide (E2/AS1 requires a minimum width of 45mm).
Be treated to at least H3.1.
Be kiln dried.
Be located centrally over studs over the wall underlay.
Fixings must be:
At 300mm centres vertically.
Staggered 12mm on either side of the batten centreline (see Figure 1).
Making it a structural fixing
To achieve structural fixing of the timber battens, the fixings should be either:
60×2.8mm jolthead hot-dip galvanised nails, or
60×2.87mm power-driven hot-dip galvanised nails, or
64×2.8mm power-driven stainless steel annular-grooved nails.
The bulletin particularly recommends the use of 60×2.87mm power-driven hot-dip galvanised nails, as they have a D head, which provides greater holding power for the batten.
It also requires that cladding fixings must still be long enough to achieve a 20mm minimum penetration into the timber framing (see Figure 2). Use jolthead hot-dip galvanised nails:
75×3.15mm for bevel-back weatherboards.
75×3.15mm for rebated bevel-back weatherboards.
60×2.8mm for rusticated weatherboards.
Fixings for the weatherboards must be located centrally over the battens and studs.
Use with other claddings
Structurally fixed timber cavity battens may be used to extra high wind zones for other claddings.
For claddings other than weatherboards, fix battens to studs at 300mm centres maximum with 75×3.15mm flathead hot-dip galvanised nails.
Sheet claddings must be fixed to the battens at 300mm centres maximum, and fixings must have enough strength to resist the loads imposed in extra high wind zones.

As promised, Under Construction will be including all compulsory Codewords articles to help LBPs earn their required points and stay up to speed with changes. This month’s article is required for carpentry, foundations, site and design licence holders
Under the new skills maintenance scheme, reading Codewords articles relevant to your licence and answering the corresponding questions is a mandatory part of skills maintenance (for those who have renewed their licence since 2 November 2015). Once you’ve read the article, answer the questions below.
Do you need a consent?
Checking if you need a building consent is an important step in any building project. If a building consent isn’t issued and was required, the council may issue an infringement notice or seek to prosecute the homeowner (with possible heavy fines), who is then likely to want answers from you.
The homeowner has the ultimate obligation to obtain all required permissions and consents – they can do this themselves, or get someone to do it on their behalf.
Carrying out work without first obtaining a building consent is a common failing, according to the Building Practitioners Board (the Board), and this is taken into consideration when acting on complaints against LBPs. We want to help make sure you don’t make this mistake.
This article will introduce exempt building work and some of the common and measurable exemptions.
Section 41
Under the Act, all building work requiresa building consent, unless it is covered by sections 41 and 42A of the Act. Work covered by section 41 is known as exempt building work, which means it doesn’t require a building consent.
Section 41 recognises that a number of things considered ‘building work’ are low risk. It allows for a list of building work that doesn’t require a building consent under Schedule 1 of the Act. If your building work isn’t covered by an exemption, you must make sure there is a building consent before you begin work.
All building work must comply with the Building Code, regardless of whether a building consent is required.
Schedule 1
Schedule 1 lists the items of exempt building work. If you’re working outside of those items listed, you need to obtain a building consent before beginning work. Below are some generalised examples; however, always refer to Schedule 1 for details of what’s exempt and what’s not.
Exemption 3 – Single-storey detached buildings not exceeding 10m2 in floor area
You’re able to build some single-storey detached buildings such as sheds, cabins or sleep outs with a net floor area (total usable floor area within the enclosing walls) of less than 10m2 without a building consent. There are exceptions, for example, it cannot include any sanitary facilities.
If the building has a net floor area of more than 10m2 or it does not meet the details of the exemption, it will need a building consent. This structure also cannot be closer to the boundary or any residential building than its total height. In this case, you’ll need a building consent.
Exemption 20 – Retaining walls
A retaining wall does not require a building consent if it is retaining less than 1.5m of ground and does not support a surcharge. A surcharge is an additional load on the land, such as a car park or driveway, a slope or a building (Schedule 1 guidance provides more detail).
Exemption 21 – Fences and hoardings
You can build a fence or a hoarding up to 2.5m above the supporting ground without a building consent. However, you still need to comply with requirements of the Fencing Act 1978 for boundary fences and, in many cases, with district plans. This may mean a resource consent is required if the fence is above 2m in height.
Exemption 24 – Decks, platforms, bridges boardwalks, etc
Building work in relation to a deck, platform, bridge, boardwalk or the like does not require a building consent as long as it is not possible to fall more than 1.5m from that surface, even if it collapses.
You’ll still require a safety barrier where there is a potential fall of 1m or more, but no consent would be required given the above.
Next time…
The next article in our Exempt Building Work series will cover off some of the more complex exemptions. Full details and examples of exempt building work can be found in the guidance provided on MBIE’s Building Performance website.
Please note that this guidance will be updated to include exemption 21A – Means of restricting access to small heated pools.

Foundation walls provide support to the external walls of buildings. On flat sites their design and construction is quite straightforward, however, when the site has uneven or sloping ground the requirements are more complex
Under NZS 3604:2011 Timberframed buildings , foundation walls may be constructed from reinforced concrete, reinforced concrete masonry or a combination of the two.
The footing sizes, width of walls and reinforcement requirements should be as shown in NZS 3604:2011 :
Figure 6.13 for cantilever foundation walls.
Figure 6.14 for single-storey buildings.
Figure 6.15 for two-storey buildings. Figure 1 – click to enlarge
Figure 1 – click to enlarge
Figure 1 – click to enlarge
Other requirements for foundation walls include that:
The top surface of the foundation wall provides continuous support for the wall plate.
The underside of the footings is horizontal.
The footings are at least 200mm below cleared ground level and on solid bearing ground.
The minimum height for walls is at least 225mm above finished ground level.
The maximum height from the underside of the footing to the top of the wall is no more than 2m, except at step in footing when height may be 2.6m for a maximum length 1.5m.
Different when stepped foundation walls
Where the ground is sloping or uneven, the foundation wall may need to be stepped to accommodate changes in ground level and remain within the maximum permitted height for foundation walls.
Requirements for stepped foundation walls are described in NZS 3604:2011 clauses 6.11.2, 6.11.4 and 6.11.5 and in Figure 6.12 (see Figure 1). These include that:
Figure 2 – click to enlarge
The maximum height of the wall at an overlap may be increased to 2.6m for a wall length of up to 1.5m.
Steps must have a minimum horizontal overlap of 450mm.
When both top and bottom surfaces of the wall are stepped, the steps must overlap 450mm minimum both vertically and horizontally.
Additional horizontal and vertical D12 reinforcing bars are required at the steps as shown in Figure 6.12 (in addition to the reinforcing requirements for foundation walls as shown in Figures 6.13, 6.14 and 6.15).
Where they are required, horizontal reinforcing bars must be lapped by at least 500mm.
When the floor framing is supported on jack studs, the underside of the wall and footing must be stepped at least 600mm, and the length of wall on the lower side of the step must be no less than 1.2m and no more than 5m long.
Note that, if the top surface of the foundation wall is level, the footing may be stepped to accommodate ground slope but there is no minimum step height (see Figure 2).

Proprietary wall bracing systems are commonly used to brace a building, but how are braced walls connected to a concrete slab? BRANZ provides insight to both NZS 3604:2011 and proprietary wall bracing elements requirements
Light timber-framed buildings designed to NZS 3604:2011 Timber-framed buildings require braced internal and external walls to manage the loads placed on the building through the actions of wind and seismic events.
The designer calculates the relevant loads, both along and across the building, to determine the total bracing units (BUs) required to meet these loads. They then incorporate wall bracing systems made up of wall bracing elements to meet or exceed the load requirements.
Range of types and capacities
Proprietary wall bracing systems are generally used to brace a building. They come in a range of types and are rated by their capacity to manage both wind and seismic loads, in bracing units per lineal metre (BU/m). The bracing ratings of these proprietary systems are determined by tests based on the BRANZ P21 test methodology.
The proprietary wall bracing connections that make up these systems generally incorporate a combination of brackets or straps and mechanical fasteners to connect the bottom plate and studs of the wall assembly to the floor of the building.
NZS 3604:2011 sets requirements for connecting both internal and external wall bottom plates to concrete floors, using either cast-in anchors or proprietary post-fixed anchors. The NZS 3604:2011 requirements for placement and minimum load capacity will generally be different and of lower capacity than for anchors in proprietary wall bracing systems.
Follow manufacturer’s requirements
Connections of proprietary wall bracing elements to concrete slab floors must follow the manufacturer’s requirements. This is particularly important with post-fixed anchor connections for bottom plates of exterior bracing walls, where the as-built performance capacity of the system can be severely compromised by the incorrect selection and installation of the anchors.
Considerations with proprietary post-fixed anchors
Proprietary post-fixed anchors come in a range of types including expanding wedge or sleeve, screw and chemical set stud anchors.
Let’s look at some important considerations for proprietary post-fixed anchors in a bracing element on concrete slab floors, in both internal and external walls.
Minimum capacity NZS 3604:2011 clauses 7.5.12.3, 7.5.12.4 and 8.6.1.8 set the following minimum capacity requirements for bottom plate anchors:
In external walls:
Horizontal loads in the plane of the wall are 2kN.
Horizontal loads out of the plane of the wall are 3kN.
Vertical loads in axial tension of the fastener are 7kN.
In internal walls:
Horizontal loads in the plane of the wall are 2kN.
Horizontal loads out of the plane of the wall are 2kN.
It is important that the correct type of post-fixed anchor is used – one that meets the capacity requirements in addition to the NZS 3604:2011
Floor slab edge distance NZS 3604:2011 clause 7.5.12.1 calls for maintaining a minimum slab edge distance of 50mm for cast-in anchors to exterior walls where the slab edge is formed with either in-situ concrete or masonry header blocks. However, it states no minimum dimension for slab edge distance of proprietary post-fixed anchors.
Manufacturers do state minimum slab edge distances for proprietary post-fixed anchors to ensure bracing capacity requirements are met, and these must be complied with. Slab edge distances are often more than 50mm.
It may not always be possible to meet these edge distance requirements with a 90 × 45mm external wall bottom plate. In these cases, 140 × 45mm framing may be required.
Maximum centres NZS 3604:2011 calls for proprietary post-fixed anchors to be located within 150mm of each end of a bottom plate and spaced at a maximum of 900mm centres or 600mm centres when used on slab edges formed by masonry header blocks.
Manufacturers, however, require specific location and centre spacings for their anchors to meet bracing capacity, and these must be complied with.
Minimum embedment NZS 3604:2011 clause 7.5.12.1 calls for a minimum embedment for cast-in anchors to exterior walls – 90mm where the slab edge is formed with in-situ concrete or 120mm when formed with masonry header blocks. It states no minimum embedment for proprietary post-fixed anchors, however.
Manufacturers set specific embedment requirements for anchors – this must be complied with and requires the correct depth and diameter hole to be drilled.
Installing proprietary anchors correctly
Careful attention is needed to install bottom plate anchors correctly. When installing anchors, ensure the:
Required slab edge distance is achieved – it is possible to blow out the slab edge during installation if the anchor is too close.
Correct depth and diameter hole.
Hole is thoroughly cleaned out after drilling.
Screw is not overtightened – torque settings generally vary from 40–80Nm.
Required embedment depth is achieved.

TITLE   : Exposed aggregate concrete

An exposed aggregate finish is the name given to concrete where the top layer of cement paste has been removed to reveal the aggregate, resulting in an attractive, low-maintenance and slip-resistant surface – here’s how to achieve one
T he colour, shape and size of the aggregates (whether rounded or crushed) can be used to create a unique surface, texture and appearance. Talk to your local supplier to discuss the options available.
When selecting the desired aggregate, it’s important to consider grading – the size distribution of the aggregate particles.
Most conventional concrete mixes use continuously graded aggregates – a well-distributed mix of all particle sizes. However, these mixes can lead to a non-uniform distribution of aggregates when exposed. To achieve a uniform exposure, intermediate aggregate sizes are omitted and a gap-graded blend is used.
The matrix
If the mix is not tinted with pigments, the colour of fine aggregate dictates the overall matrix colour. For a large project, it is advisable to stockpile fine and coarse aggregates from a single source to avoid colour variation.
The colour of the cement also affects the matrix. For more consistent colour, it is advisable to stay with one supplier and cement type.
Adding the Aggregates
Aggregates are normally added using one of three methods:
1. Integral mixing
In integral mixing, aggregates are added to the mix at the batching plant. The concrete is placed, vibrated, screeded and bull-floated, resulting in approximately 2mm coverage of cement paste over the aggregates.
2. Topping mix
With a topping mix, the coloured aggregate is placed only in the upper layer of concrete. The underlying concrete is typically placed to within 25-40mm below the finished level and the topping mix is then placed and consolidated while the underlying concrete is in its plastic phase.
3. Seeding the surface
Course aggregates can also be added to freshly poured concrete by sprinkling them over the surface and fully embedding them by tamping and working with a wooden float. This method is known as ‘seeding the surface’.
Exposing the aggregates
The most common method of exposing aggregates is the ‘wash-off’ method. When the concrete has stiffened sufficiently to support a person whose footprints are no deeper than 2mm, then surface cement paste can be washed off to expose the aggregate.
A medium bristle broom and continuous water spray are used. The surface should not be over-broomed, as this can result in dislodging the stones and mixing water into the underlying cement paste, which can weaken the surface.
While it is not uncommon to wash off the cement paste with a water blaster, high-water pressure should be avoided as it can damage the surface. Proprietary spray-on retarders can be used to prolong the available working time and give a consistent and predetermined depth of exposure.
These retarders are applied with a backpack sprayer, typically with a long spray boom to reach the centre of the slab.
After curing, a mild acid wash (5% hydrochloric acid) is sometimes applied to remove any remaining cement paste that may dull the appearance of the exposed aggregate. The surface is then thoroughly washed and a sealer applied if desired.
Protecting the environment
The wash water used to expose aggregates contains sediment and has a high pH (alkaline) level. If allowed to run into waterways, it can chemically burn fish, insects and plants.
Advice on good practice is explained in the New Zealand Ready Mixed Concrete Association (NZRMCA) document On Site Management of Concrete Washwater, which can be downloaded from www.nzrmca.org.nz.
The advice is to prevent discharge to waterways by discharging to land or collecting runoff for off-site disposal.

In some situations, a freestanding deck or platform may be a simpler solution than an attached deck. Although the design requirements for both are generally the same, there are some differences to consider
The design requirements for decks attached to a building are set out in NZS 3604:2011 Timber- framed buildings section 7.4. Where applicable, the structural and durability requirements and the selection of timber, fixings and fastenings are the same for both freestanding and attached decks.
Subfloor bracing requirements are set out in NZS 3604:2011 Section 5. Piles may be braced, anchor or cantilevered, or a combination of these.
When determining bracing, first calculate the bracing demand for the deck.
Select the earthquake zone from NZS 3604:2011 Figure 5.4 Earthquake zone maps.
Obtain the bracing demand from NZS 3604:2011 Table 5.8. Using half the value for light cladding for wall, roof and subfloor and 0–25° roof pitch, this is 15 × 0.5 – 7.5 BU/m².
Multiply the bracing demand by a factor (given at the bottom of Table 5.8) for soil class and earthquake zone.
Multiply the resulting value by the area of the deck to calculate the total number of bracing units (bus) required in each direction ( NZS 3604:2011 5.3.1 ).
Example: For a proposed 10m² (5×2m) deck, with an earthquake zone three and soil class E. From Table 5.8, the multiplication factor is 1.0, so 15 ×0.5 × 1.0 = 7.5 BU/m². Multiply 7.5 BU/m² by the area of the deck to obtain the total bus required gives 7.5 × 10–75 bus in each direction.
There are no specific requirements in NZS 3604:2011 for bracing distribution for freestanding decks, but the following rules should be used as far as practicable. Bracing should be:
Provided in two directions at right angles to one another to provide horizontal support.
Located in perimeter foundation and subfloor framing.
Located in internal lines parallel to the perimeter at a maximum of 5.0m centres.
Distributed as evenly as possible along each line.
The maximum height of the piles will influence the choice of braced pile system ( NZS 3604: 2011 6.4.4.1 (b) ). This is summarised in Table 1 and Figures 1–5 on this and the following pages.
Except for driven piles, all timber piles must have a concrete footing that is at least 100mm below the pile and be cast in situ on undisturbed good ground.
Footings below cleared ground level must have a minimum depth of:
200mm for ordinary piles.
450mm for braced piles.
900mm for anchor piles.
The plan area of the footing depends on bearer and joist spans, and is determined from NZS 3604:2011 Table 6.1, except that braced and anchor piles must be a minimum of 350×350mm for square piles and 400mm diameter for round piles.
Bearer sizes are selected from NZS 3604:2011 Table 6.4 Part (b) for a 2kPa wet-in-service floor load ( NZS 3604:2011 6.12 ). They must:
Be continuous over two or more spans.
Be laid in straight lines on edge.
Have a minimum landing of 90mm, except this may be 45mm where butted over the support.
Be jointed only over ordinary pile supports (i.e, they must not be jointed where the bearer is fixed directly to an anchor or braced pile).
Have a connection capacity at joists of: · 12kN minimum capacity in tension or compression along the line of the bearer, or · 6kN minimum capacity each on both sides of a continuous bearer.
Timber joists for decks are selected from NZS 3604:2011 Table 7.1 Part (b) for a 2kPa wet-in-service floor load. They must be laid in straight lines on edge with top surfaces set to a common level and have 32mm minimum bearing over supports.
Joist fixings to piles or bearers are in NZS 3604:2011 6.8.6 :
If the brace is connected to the pile and parallel to the joist direction, the two joists on either side of the brace must be fixed to the bearer with a 6kN capacity connection in the horizontal direction.
If the brace is connected to the joist, the joist to bearer connection must have 12kN capacity in the vertical direction (see NZS 3604:2011 Figure 6.8).
Bearers and joists connected to anchor piles must be fixed with: · M12 bolts with 50×50×3mm washers, or · 12mm diameter threaded rod and washers, or · 12kN capacity connections in tension or compression along the joist or bearer.
Where an opening (such as for stairs) is required in a deck, trimmers and trimming joists must be fitted around the opening in accordance with NZS 3604:2011 7.1.6 .

Flashing junctions can be tricky, but it’s important to get them right. Here we review the steps for barge and ridge flashing intersections and termination of a raked apron flashing
Flashings are a critical component of the weathertightness of a building, whether protecting the head of a window or a roof cladding junction. It’s important flashings are folded accurately and assembled in the right order. Read the steps below to find out how to correctly install and assemble flashings.
While metal flashings need to be aesthetically pleasing, to ensure they will be durable and watertight after installation, you must:
Allow for thermal movement.
Prevent damage to factory-applied coatings during installation.
Correctly lap the flashing elements so that water cannot get into and/or be trapped within the joint.
Avoid total reliance on sealants to weatherproof the junction.
Ensure the finished joint is neat and precise with straight folds where required.
Install the fixings through the flashing and into underlying framing.
Meet cladding and bargeboard cover requirements – for buildings within the scope of E2/AS1, Table 7 gives the required flashing covers for the wind zone the building is erected in.
Two flashings junctions that need to be accurately folded and assembled in the right order are:
The intersections of the barge flashing and the ridge flashing to the gable end of a roof (see Figures 1–4).
The termination of a raked apron flashing that requires the forming of a stop-end by folding the flashing (see Figures 5–7) or by inserting a proprietary fabricated stop-end at the termination of the flashing.

Dampness and moisture problems are well-known features of many New Zealand houses. When undertaking renovations, or building new, there are some key ways to knock moisture problems on the head – or stop them from occurring in the first place.
The biggest concern about damp homes relates to their effect on inhabitants’ health: internal moisture makes it harder to keep houses warm and encourages the growth of mould and breeding of dust mites – all of which can cause or worsen asthma, bronchitis and other breathing disorders.
Although building design (orientation, insulation, ventilation) can make a big difference to whether houses will be damp, the way you build the house also has a huge impact. New houses usually have high internal moisture levels for up to two years after construction. Moisture comes from concrete, masonry, timber, plaster and paint – all of which take time to dry out.
There are a number of things you can do to reduce the amount of construction moisture, and therefore the drying time:
Building during summer (particularly those early critical stages before the house is enclosed) can make a huge difference – concrete slabs and timber that has been rained on take a lot longer to dry out, even once enclosed.
Ensure materials are dry before enclosing the house – materials dry much faster in open air. Timber framing with the 20% moisture allowed by the Building Code will still contribute around 200 litres of water into the average house. Regard the Building Code as a minimum and let timber dry out as much as possible.
Take particular care with concrete – 1m 3 of concrete has around 95 litres of water, which needs to evaporate out even once it’s been cured. There’s a lot of water in a concrete slab. Wet concrete should have the minimum amount of water added to enable it to be workable – check the slump of concrete which arrives for your slab pour and don’t accept concrete which is too wet.
Ensure there is a ground moisture barrier under both concrete slabs and suspended floors – about 45 litres of water per day comes out of the ground under a 93m 2 house and 90 litres per day under a 186m 2 house.
Many existing homes have dampness and moisture problems caused by a combination of factors, such as rising damp, lack of ventilation, insufficient insulation and leaks. Renovations represent a real opportunity to solve these problems, so make sure your client thinks not just about the cosmetic factor, but also gets a house that is drier and healthier to live in.
The table below outlines some common problems contributing to moisture, as well as solutions for your clients.
Sometimes it’s hard to work out the underlying cause of dampness in a house. If it’s not obvious, it’s a good idea to get an accredited Home Performance Advisor or, if your council has one, an Eco Design Advisor to come and take a look at the house. They can talk to you and your client about potential solutions and the most effective way to make the house dry and healthy.

Penetrations through claddings need to be carefully detailed to ensure weather tightness. For commercial buildings, they may also need to be seismically restrained to prevent impact damage. This month we cover what rules apply to various situations
New Zealand Building Code clause B1 Structure requires conditions that may affect the stability of buildings and building elements, such as earthquakes, to be considered. This means that services passing through the building structure and cladding may require seismic restraint.
For engineering systems, these requirements are usually met using the Building Code support document B1/VM1 , which cites NZS 4219:2009 Seismic performance of engineering systems in buildings .
This standard contains prescriptive and specific engineering design options for restraining engineering systems. This includes allowing a minimum 50mm clearance around any service penetrations through walls, to prevent impact damage in an earthquake (see Figure 1).
Water pipes don’t usually need seismic restraint.
Seismic restraint isn’t required (NZS 4219:2009 5.8.1) where pipes are:
Less than 50mm in diameter.
Suspended by individual hangers that are 150mm or less in length from the top of the pipe to the supporting structure.
Water pipes are therefore generally unlikely to require seismic restraint, but must still have a 50mm clearance when passing through exterior walls.
Larger pipes, such as sewer pipes (typically 100mm in diameter) and flues, are likely to require seismic restraint in accordance with NZS 4219:2009 for commercial buildings.
In addition, Building Code clause E2 External moisture requires that exterior walls must prevent penetration of water that could cause dampness or damage to building elements.
If not appropriately designed and installed, penetrations through external claddings potentially compromise the weathertightness of a building. The requirements of clauses B1 and E2 are at odds with one another and can present detailing problems.
Timber-frame construction
Acceptable Solution E2/AS1 (paragraph 9.1.9.3 and Figures 68 and 69) describes methods of creating weathertight details, using flashing tape and flanges in both cavity and direct-fixed situations.
The E2/AS1 details do not require a significant clearance around pipes, but they can be used as a basis for creating weathertight details that include the clearances required by clause B1.
Through wall underlay
Where the pipe penetrates through the wall underlay, flexible flashing tape should be used to seal the underlay for at least 100mm and to the pipe for at least 25mm (see Figure 2).
A flange with a diameter 20mm larger than the pipe, and with a skirt at least 25mm deep, should be fitted over the pipe. The 10mm gap between pipe and flange can be filled with sealant applied over a backing rod.
Coated cladding
Where cladding finishes are EIFS, monolithic coatings or stucco, finish the coating over the skirt of the flange.
Weatherboard claddings
For weatherboard claddings, cut a hole to the correct size (diameter of pipe plus 10mm all around) through the weatherboard. The penetration should be made through the centre of the board, not at a joint. Prime the cut, then apply sealant over a backing rod into the gap between the hole and the pipe.
A flange may be installed over the sealant joint. For bevel-back boards, a shaped fillet will be required to provide a flat surface for the flange (see Figure 3).
Concrete or masonry walls
Where pipes penetrate concrete or masonry walls, a 50mm clearance must be allowed between the pipe and the wall structure when following NZS 4219:2009 . Apply a waterproof membrane to the opening – at least 50mm around the face of the opening and at least 50mm into the opening.
The pipe should go through a flange with a minimum 20mm larger diameter than the pipe and a skirt at least 100mm deep. Apply sealant over a backing rod to the gap between the pipe and flange and carry the waterproofing coat applied to the concrete or masonry down over the flange (see Figure 4).
Close coordination between building designers, structural engineers, fire engineers and building services engineers is needed from the preliminary design stage of a building project. This ensures that the weathertightness, fire and seismic requirements of penetrations through external walls are fully considered and implemented.

Missing documentation and poorly executed drawings are two of the main reasons a consent application may generate a request for information (RFI). Levy-funded research found there’s room for consistency and clear guidance on building consent drawings to improve them and lift the understanding of those reading them – thereby streamlining the consenting process
A key task for a building designer, after agreeing on a design with a client, is to transform that design into a set of construction documents that facilitate the accurate construction of the building. The documents also form the basis of a building consent application. Obtaining a consent will allow construction to proceed.
What’s the problem?
Importantly, the documents need to be understood and followed by all those involved in the building process, including the client, the building consent authority (BCA) officials who process the consent application and review the construction, builders and associated subtrades doing the pricing and carrying out construction, material suppliers… the list goes on!
The vexed issue of requests for information in Build 205 looked at the behaviours of those preparing building consent applications and the BCA staff processing them and discussed some associated problems.
It noted that the BRANZ external research report ModelDocs: Transforming building consenting behaviour for better housing found a significant difference between what designers believe is sufficient documentation for a consent application and what BCAs require to process the application. This means there’s a high number of RFIs issued following consent applications, creating delays in the process and causing frustration all round.
Complex designs
The ModelDocs report also showed that some of the documentation issues may relate to the complexity of buildings being submitted for consent.
Most consents lodged are for R1–R3 type residential buildings (as defined by MBIE’s national BCA competency assessment system levels). The difference in complexity between an R1 building and an R3 building is significant, with a corresponding difference in the documentation required. The complexity levels of C1–C3 non-residential buildings are different again and require another level of documentation.
Look to MBIE for guidance
A surprising finding of the report is that the industry may not be fully aware of the guidance currently available on building consent documentation requirements – yet MBIE’s Building Performance team provides plenty.
For example, How to support your building consent application provides guidance on a range of supporting documentation – from Acceptable Solutions and Verification Methods to producer statements and design features reports. The guidance also includes a standard order of documents checklist for building consent applications with information about building plans (drawings) and supporting documents such as geotechnical reports and H1 Energy efficiency calculations. The guidance clearly identifies what plans are required and what they should include.
Guidance on the building consent process is also available. Understanding the building consent process covers everything from RFIs to start and end dates.
Then there’s the Co-ordinated Building Information (CBI) system – a classification system for the construction industry covering the five main information sources associated with construction: drawings, specifications, quantities, technical and research information, and trade information and publications. This is also a useful aid to preparing consent documentation.
Further, all BCAs provide building consent lodgement checklists. While these vary in detail, they cover all the information needed to process a consent, clearly define the sequence of documents and provide clear guidance on drawings that need to be included with each aspect of a project. They also differentiate between requirements for residential and commercial buildings.
Regardless of what documentation is submitted for consent, the main area of conjecture often relates to the relevancy and quality of that documentation, particularly the drawings.
No professional guidance on preparing drawings
What appears to be missing is specific guidance for those preparing consent drawings from the professional bodies that represent them. Designers produce most of the documentation but lack supporting information from their representative bodies.
Building officials often encounter drawings that not only lack adequate detail but are also difficult to follow and comprehend. While commercial pressures or budgetary constraints are often given as reasons for these deficiencies, ModelDocs also identified a frequent lack of knowledge about what’s required by the BCA and the compliance requirements of some Building Code clauses.
ModelDocs also found varying ability among building officials to understand drawings, so there’s a need for drawings to be prepared in a way they can be read and understood by all involved in the consent and building process.
On the other hand, it’s often noted by building officials and builders that sets of drawings contain too much information – adding to the processing time and creating confusion.
Drawings in a digital format or at a smaller scale are often given as reasons for rejection. Small-scale drawings often lack sufficient identification or explanation of critical aspects of construction.
Relevancy is another concern. Often drawings don’t accurately relate to a building because they have been cut and pasted or use inappropriate details from a common library. Designers need to be more diligent about selecting details that relate specifically to the design.
There is also often a disconnection between the drawings required to construct the building and those required to get the consent. Some designers are said to prepare construction drawings suitable for builders and subtrades to price and construct the building and then add the minimum extra information that will allow the building consent to be processed.
Examples of typologies should be available
There’s an opportunity to provide clear guidance on what’s required for building consent drawings. Improving the content and quality of drawings should not only streamline the consenting process but also improve the understanding of all those needing to read and interpret them.
An openly available exemplar of acceptable consent and construction drawings, across a range of typical building technologies, would be useful for designers and should be relatively easy to compile.
Similarly, more consistency among BCAs on the required components of consent documentation – such as a standard building consent lodgement checklist – would improve the quality of that documentation. Also required is a focus on consent documentation in continuing professional development across all industry professions.
With the potential for AI to be used for building consent processing soon, consistency and conformity of documentation across the industry will become even more critical.

Getting building basics right is critical for weathertight construction. Here, we look at the correct way to install wall underlay and flashing tape to exterior window and door openings in light timber or lightweight steel-framed dwellings, before installing aluminium joinery
T here is potential over the life of a dwelling for water to enter through the exterior cladding into the wall assembly. This can occur through the junctions between the exterior joinery and the cladding or through the seals and joints of aluminium joinery, particularly at corners.
This ingress moisture may reach the wall framing and, as the framing is vulnerable, it needs protection.
Protecting framing from moisture
Under Building Code Acceptable Solution E2/AS1 , exterior openings are initially protected with a combination of flexible wall underlay and flexible flashing tape.
While installing the protective layers of underlay and tape is relatively straightforward, it is critical that it is done accurately as it is inaccessible once the exterior cladding/joinery has been installed.
Flexible flashing tape
Flexible flashing tape is installed over the wall underlay to provide another layer of protection to the framing in critical areas of the window opening:
At each corner including the exposed triangles of framing.
Along the full length of the sill.
There are generally two types of self-adhesive flexible flashing tape available – conformable and non-conformable. The installation process is slightly different for each, as outlined below.
Construction sequence starts the same
We step through the preparation of a typical window opening (with sill above floor level) and highlight some key considerations.
Step 1: Wall underlay
Install the flexible wall underlay (building wrap) to the exterior face of the wall framing and carry it completely across the window opening.
Step 2: Cut and fold wall underlay to opening
When ready for window installation, cut the wall underlay diagonally (at 45°) from corner to corner across the opening. Tightly fold it into the opening and over the full depth of the framing. Secure the underlay to the inside edge – for light timber framing, generally secure with staples, and for lightweight steel framing, fix with flathead screws or double-sided construction tape (in accordance with the underlay manufacturer’s instructions).
Trim off the excess underlay at the internal face of the framing. This leaves an exposed triangle of framing at each corner of the opening, which is covered with flashing tape at the next step.
Conformable flashing tape installation (use steps 3–6)
Flashing tape is installed to the full depth of the framed opening as well as out over the face of the framing/underlay. Conformable tape may be preferred as it can be stretched around and out over the face at corners.
Step 3: Install tape to the top corners
Begin by installing tape to the top corners. The tape width must allow for the depth of framing (generally 90 or 140mm) plus a minimum of 50mm lap out over the face of the framing/underlay.
Fix one length of tape (of the required length/width) to the underlay in the opening at each top corner for the full depth of the framing a minimum of 100mm across the head and down the jamb.
The tape must overhang the outer face of the framing/underlay a minimum of 50mm.
Step 4: Fold overhanging tape back
Next, fold the overhanging tape back, accurately stretching the tape to form it around the corner, and fix it to the outer face of the framing/underlay at the corner and across the head and down the jamb. Maintain a minimum of 50mm cover.
Step 5: Repeat for sill
Follow the same initial process for the sill, with one length of tape running the full width of the sill, a minimum of 100mm up the jamb at each corner and overhanging the outer face of the framing/ underlay a minimum of 50mm.
Step 6: Fold overhanging tape back
Again, fold the overhanging tape back, accurately stretching the tape to form it around the corner, and fix it to the outer face of the framing/underlay at the corner, up each jamb and along the full length of the sill. Maintain a minimum of 50mm cover.
Non-conformable flashing tape installation (use steps 7–11)
As this tape is unable to be stretched, the tape installed to the window corners and sill will need to be cut at the corners during installation. This allows it to be folded out over the face of the framing/underlay.
Step 7: Fix tape diagonally across corners
When the tape is ultimately fixed out over the framing/underlay, an untaped area of underlay at the face of each corner is left.
Prior to installing tape to the window corners and sill, these untaped areas must be protected by fixing a suitable length of tape, fully covering the area that would otherwise remain untaped diagonally across the face of each corner of the opening.
Step 8: Install flashing tape to the top corners
Next, install tape to the top corners. The tape width must allow for the depth of framing (generally 90 or 140mm) plus a minimum of 50mm lap out over the face of the framing/underlay.
Fix one length of tape (of the required length/ width) to the underlay in the opening at each top corner for the full depth of the framing a minimum of 100mm across the head and down the jamb.
The tape must overhang the outer face of the framing/underlay a minimum of 50mm.
Step 9: Cut, fold and fix flashing tape
Cut the portion of overhanging tape at each corner. Fold the tape back and fix it to the outer face of the framing/underlay at the head and jamb and over the pre-installed diagonal tape at each corner. Maintain a minimum of 50mm cover.
Step 10: Install flashing tape to sill
Follow the same initial process for the sill, with one length of tape running the full width of the sill, a minimum of 100mm up the jamb at each corner and overhanging the outer face of the framing/underlay a minimum of 50mm.
Step 11: Cut, fold and fix tape for sill
Cut the portion of overhanging tape at the corner, fold the tape back and fix it to the outer face of the framing/underlay across the width of the sill, up each jamb and over the preinstalled diagonal tape at the corners. Keep a minimum of 50mm cover.
Several key considerations
Accurate installation of flashing tape is critical as it protects the opening sill and corners, including the exposed triangles of framing at the corners not covered by wall underlay. Here are a few pointers:
Ensure that the flexible flashing tape specified meets all relevant requirements and is compatible with the wall underlay.
Follow all tape manufacturer’s installation instructions.
The face of the underlay must be clean, dry and dust free prior to tape installation. Some tapes may require a primer or extra adhesive to be applied to the surface prior to installation.
Ensure the tape is well fixed to the underlay. It must be wrinkle and fold free – a flexible plastic applicator can be used to ensure accurate application and good adhesion.
Avoid excessive tape build up, which can cause aluminium joinery and air seal installation issues and may result in damage to the tape.

Prevent external moisture from damaging a home by closing the top of ventilated cavities.
Clause E2 External Moisture aims to keep external moisture from damaging a home. E2.3.5 states that: “concealed spaces and cavities in buildings must be constructed in a way that prevents external moisture [from] being accumulated or transferred and causing condensation, fungal growth or the degradation of building elements”.
Specific requirements for cavities in E2/AS1 clause 9.1.8.2c include that a drained cavity, where required, shall restrict air movement between the drained cavity and:
Floor, wall and roof framing.
Attic roof space.
Subfloor space.
Moist air, if present in roof spaces, may condense on cold nights and drip on to insulation, wetting it and compromising the R-value, which can then create rust or rot problems in ceiling or roof members. Correctly detailing the soffit-to-wall framing junction will help prevent moist air from cavities getting into the ceiling, where a flexible wall underlay is used.
“Correctly detailing the soffit-to-wall framing junction will help prevent moist air from cavities getting into the ceiling, where a flexible wall underlay is used
For timber frames, the flexible wall underlay may billow or bulge away from the soffit bearer, allowing cavity air into the roof space (see Figure 1). This can be overcome by:
Ensuring insulation is installed for the full framing depth.
Adding an additional batten fixed to the soffit bearer from inside.
Fixing the flexible wall underlay to the soffit bearer from inside to hold the wall underlay tight to the back of the soffit bearer.
Where vertical weatherboards or sheet claddings are used, there should be a row of dwangs behind the top cavity closing batten to fix the cladding to (see Figure 2). The flexible wall underlay must be sandwiched tight, so nothing extra is required.
“Moist air, if present in roof spaces, may condense on cold nights and drip on to insulation, wetting it and compromising the R-value, which can then create rust or rot problems in ceiling or roof members
The same applies to steel framing that has strips of thermal break applied to the steel. Care is required where thermal breaks are attached to the frames. To close off the cavity to the roof space, an additional full-depth C-section will be required behind the soffit runner when the runner is below the top plate (see Figure 3).
The best option for steel framing is to use a thermal break sheet material over the whole frame. Cavity battens, where required, are then installed over the thermal break and wall underlay, and a closing C-section is installed directly under or behind the soffit line, alternatively, fix the sheet material from the inside to the soffit runner. This will then close off the cavity to the roof space.

Every industry has its own technical terms and jargon, and the concrete industry is no exception. To test your knowledge, we have pulled together some of the most common terms
The answers are presented in lay terms; for a technically precise definition refer to ACI 116 — Cement and Concrete Terminology.
Admixture vs Additive
An admixture is a material other than water, aggregate, cement or fibres, which is added to a batch of concrete. Typical examples are air entraining, water reducing, accelerating or retarding admixtures. Additive is normally reserved for materials used by cement manufacturers to modify the properties of cement. Examples include limestone or gypsum.
Entrained air vs Entrapped air
Entrained air is made up of microscopic air bubbles that are intentionally incorporated into the concrete, normally to improve its freeze/thaw resistance. Entrapped air is made up of bubbles, of 1 mm diameter or larger, which are accidentally incorporated into the concrete during the production process, and should be removed via compaction.
The presence of air reduces the strength of concrete. However, because entrained air is deliberately incorporated into the mix, the mix designer will have compensated for its presence. This is not the case with entrapped air.
Consolidation vs Vibration
Consolidation (or compaction) is the process of inducing a closer spacing arrangement of the solid particles when placing concrete. It can be achieved by various methods including vibration, rodding, tamping, or centrifugation. Therefore, vibration is one method of consolidating concrete.
Floating vs Trowelling
The purpose of floating a concrete surface is to create a relatively even but open texture.
Floating:
Embeds large aggregates beneath the surface.
Removes slight imperfections to produce a surface closer to the true plane.
Compacts the surface.
Closes minor surface cracks which may appear as the surface dries.
A bull float is a large float on a long handle which is used prior to the appearance of the bleed water. Hand floats are typically made of wood or magnesium and do not have sharp edges, which would close the surface of the concrete. Power floating occurs after the bleed water has evaporated from the surface, and is done using blades with turned-up edges to prevent them closing the concrete surface.
Trowelling occurs sometime after floating and creates a hard, dense, closed finish to the concrete surface. Steel blades are used for hand trowelling. The blades on a power trowelling machine are thinner than a float blade and have sharp edges to close the concrete surface.
Placing vs Pouring
Placing involves the deposition, distribution and consolidation of concrete in the place where it is to harden. This process is often inappropriately referred to as pouring. However, pouring only refers to the deposition phase. Always refer to placing rather than pouring concrete.
Prestress vs Post-tensioned vs. Pre-tension Concrete
Prestressed concrete is hardened concrete that is in a state of compression prior to the application of the service loads. Subsets of this generic term are post-tensioned and pre-tensioned concrete, which indicate how the compressive force is applied to the concrete.
With pre-tensioning, the tendons are tensioned before the concrete is placed and hardened. An example of this would be most of the preparatory flooring systems such as Hollowcore slabs. In post-tensioning, ducts are typically provided in the concrete and the tendons are tensioned after the concrete has hardened. Examples would be posttensioned slabs-on-grade.
Concrete vs Cement
It may appear obvious, but there are enough American movies talking about cement paths to indicate that some confusion does exist. Cement is the fine, normally grey powder that, when mixed with water, reacts and in time goes hard. Concrete is a mixture of cement, aggregates, water and admixtures, and typically comes out the back of a ready mixed concrete truck.
Reinforcing Grade vs Class
Grade refers to the strength of the reinforcing bar, typically 300 or 500MPa. Class refers to the ductility (“stretchability”) of the bar. The most ductile and commonly used bar in New Zealand is Class E (Earthquake).
Concrete NZ is aligned with the New Zealand Concrete Contractors Association (NZCCA). To be a member of the NZCCA requires a high standard of knowledge and practical experience. To find out more visit www.nzconcretecontractors.org.nz

Depending where you are in the country, spring and summer can be high-risk periods for early-age concrete cracking. Higher daytime temperatures and dry winds, along with low evening temperatures, are a perfect recipe for the creation of cracks
If you want to minimise the time spent investigating and rectifying unwanted cracks in concrete, now is the time to understand the issues and the action you can take to avoid problems. The following looks at cracks which form in concrete after it has been placed but before it has set — when the concrete is in its plastic state.
Plastic cracking
The formation of cracks in concrete is somewhat inevitable and can form prior to the concrete setting, or after it is in its hardened state. During the setting stage, the moisture content of the  concrete changes and water is given off, and hence the concrete shrinks. This shrinkage leads to a volume change, and as concrete has a low tensile strength, if this volume change is restrained,  cracks will form. However, appropriate measures can entirely eliminate, or at the very least minimise, the formation of these unwanted cracks.
Cracks which form before the concrete has fully hardened (usually not less than about eight hours) are known as plastic cracks. Plastic cracking occurs as either shrinkage cracks or settlement  cracks.
Plastic shrinkage cracks
Once concrete is in place, evaporation can only occur from the free surface. In the absence of appropriate precautions, and in unfavourable drying conditions, the rate of evaporation at the surface can be greater than the rate with which water within the concrete can migrate to the surface to make good the loss. The highest risk weather for plastic shrinkage cracking is sunny and/or windy days with low humidity levels.
After concrete has been placed, vibrated, screeded and floated, it is left so the bleed water can rise to the surface. The slab cannot be finished until it is hard and the bleed water has evaporated. The bleed water will appear within about 15 minutes of placing and the slab is ready for finishing after several hours, depending on the concrete temperature. If the top surface is allowed to dry  before final finishing, then plastic shrinkage cracking may occur.
The risk of plastic shrinkage occurring is greatest when:
The temperature difference between the concrete and air temperature is large. In spring, this type of cracking can occur in an area exposed to the sun, while shaded concrete remains uncracked. Concrete exposed to the sun can be significantly hotter than the air temperature.
Low bleed concrete mixes (eg, superplasticised mixes and/or mixes with high quantities of ultrafines) are used. The more concrete bleeds, the less likely it is that the surface will prematurely dry out. As such, greater precautions are required when using low bleed concrete mixes.
There are low humidity days.
There are high wind speeds.
What do plastic shrinkage cracks look like?
Usually, the cracks occur either while finishing or within 30 minutes to six hours of finishing, form without any regular pattern, and may range from 25mm to 2m in length. They may be straight or jagged and often intersect each other forming T junctions or acute angles. The cracks vary in width from a hairline to perhaps 3mm. Additionally, while they are surface-related, the cracks may extend deeper with subsequent drying of the slab.
How can plastic shrinkage cracking be avoided?
The most effective way to reduce the risk of plastic shrinkage cracking is to prevent rapid loss of moisture from the surface of the concrete.
Practices to achieve this are:
Dampen the subgrade and formwork, while also ensuring any excess water is removed prior to placing concrete.
In hot weather, lower the temperature of the fresh concrete by using cool aggregates if possible.
Erect wind breaks to reduce wind velocity over the concrete surface.
The use of polythene sheets on the top surface of the concrete will prevent both evaporation and air movement. These should be used with caution when trying to obtain a consistent colour to the slab.
Use a proprietary evaporation retardant spray. These are inexpensive and provide a good degree of protection if used in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions.
Add polypropylene fibres to the concrete mix.
The use of polypropylene fibres works by evenly distributing many small reinforcement fibres throughout the mass of the concrete, in all directions, and intersecting any micro-cracking that occurs when the concrete shrinks.
Their physical properties are designed to match the properties (eg, the modulus of elasticity) of fresh concrete. Polypropylene fibres usually provide sufficient extra strength to prevent microcracks from widening and hence restrict the formation of plastic shrinkage cracking. Fibres are typically added at the batching plant and therefore their use requires planning. Your ready-mix concrete supplier will be able to advise on the appropriate dosage.
Commence curing promptly after finishing is complete and ensure the surface is subject to continuous curing. Providing a fog mist spray to increase humidity above the concrete is a good  means of achieving this, although it may be difficult to get a uniform application during windy conditions. It is important excess water is not added to the surface.
Plastic settlement cracks
Another form of cracking which occurs during the plastic stage of the concrete setting process is plastic settlement cracking.
Settlement cracks following straight rebar lines
Most concrete, after it is placed, bleeds. This means that water rises to the surface as the solid particles settle. The bleed water evaporates and there is a loss of total volume (ie, the concrete has  settled’). If there is no restraint, the net result is simply a very slight lowering of the surface level. However, if there is something near the surface, such as a reinforcing bar, which restrains part of  the concrete from settling while the concrete on either side continues to drop, there is potential for a crack to form over the restraining element.
Settlement cracks tend to follow a regular pattern, replicating the lines of restraint – usually the reinforcement or a change in section. Generally, the cracks are not deep, but, because they tend to follow and penetrate down to the reinforcement, they may reduce the durability of a structure.
Plastic settlement is affected by the following factors:
Rate of bleeding from the concrete.
Time over which settlement can take place – ie, the time before it sets.
Depth of reinforcement relative to total thickness of the section.
Size of reinforcement.
Constituents of the mix.
Slump.
Prevention of plastic settlement cracking
Plastic settlement cracks may be prevented, or rather closed, by revibrating the concrete after settlement is virtually complete and it has begun to set. However, the timing is critical and considerable experience is needed to know when that critical time is.
If revibration is done too early, more settlement could occur. If it is done too late, it could damage the bond between the concrete and reinforcement.
Plastic shrinkage cracks form without a regular pattern
Other procedures which may help reduce plastic settlement cracking include using:
Lower slump mixes.
More cohesive mixes.
An air entrainer to improve cohesiveness and reduce bleeding.
Increasing cover to top bars.
With an understanding of the causes and precautions that can be taken to avoid plastic cracking, this common surface defect can be easily controlled.

The new H1 acceptable solutions provide performance tables for the various types of slab-on-ground concrete floor, which vary according to climate zone. Here’s what you need to know
When using H1/AS1 as a means of compliance with Building Code clause H1 Energy efficiency , Table 2.1.2.2B of the Acceptable Solution sets minimum construction R-values for unheated slab-on-ground floors across Aotearoa New Zealand’s six climate zones. The minimum construction R-value is R1.5 for climate zones 1 – 4, R1.6 for zone 5 and R1.7 for zone 6.
H1/AS1 Appendix F Thermal resistance of slab-on-ground floors gives methods for determining the construction R-values of different formats of slab-on-ground floor.
You can use either the performance tables in section F.1.2 or a calculation method in H1/VM1 Appendix F.
The performance tables provide construction R-values for a range of generic concrete slab-on-ground floors covering floor typology, floor insulation and the external walls of the building. They also cover both slab floor and raft foundation concrete slab-on-ground floors with the following insulation options:
No insulation.
R1.0 vertical slab edge.
R1.2 or R2.4 full cover under slab.
1.2m wide strip of R1.2 or R2.4 under slab along the slab perimeter.
Combination of vertical slab edge and under slab.
The tables also incorporate building exterior wall type options – either masonry veneer or other exterior wall types.
To use the construction R-value tables, you also need to know the effective thickness of the external walls of the building and the floor slab area-to-perimeter (A/P) ratio – both are included in the tables.
Let’s look at this in more detail.
Exterior wall types
Masonry veneer is installed on a rebate around the slab perimeter. This has an impact on the thermal performance of the slab edge – hence the differentiation to other claddings where a slab rebate is not required.
Effective wall thickness
A significant amount of heat loss occurs through the vertical edge of a concrete slab. The thickness of the exterior wall assembly dictates the distance that the heat must travel to get from the interior conditioned space of the building to the exterior.
The effective thickness of the exterior wall is measured as the distance from the interior wall surface (the interior lining) to the exterior face of the vertical slab edge at floor level. The greater this distance, the more thermally efficient the concrete floor slab is, as the heat loss path through the slab edge to the exterior is greater.
Floor slab A/P ratio
Again, as a significant amount of heat loss can occur through the vertical edge of a concrete slab, the more exposed vertical slab edge relative to floor area there is, the greater the potential heat loss.
As an example, a 165m² rectangular slab with a perimeter (vertical slab edge) of 57.25m has an A/P ratio of 2.88. The same area of slab with a complex floor layout could have a perimeter of 103m, equating to an A/P ratio of 1.60.
Consequently, the lower the A/P ratio, the less thermally efficient the concrete floor slab is, as there is a greater potential for heat loss to occur (see examples in Figure 2).
The slab A/P ratio of a proposed building is calculated by using either of two equations in Appendix F – the overall internal slab area and perimeter in accordance with Equation F.1 or the external slab area and perimeter in accordance with Equation F.2.
Slab insulation material
Concrete slab insulation is typically rigid foam insulation, such as expanded polystyrene (EPS) or extruded polystyrene (XPS).
Slab edge insulation
Because a significant amount of heat loss can occur through the exposed vertical edge of the slab, slab edge insulation is a very effective way of improving slab thermal performance. The R-value tables in H1/AS1 incorporate R1.0 vertical slab edge insulation. R1.0 is optimal for this type of insulation, as using higher R-value insulation provides minimal performance gains.
To be effective, the insulation must be installed on all exposed faces of the slab edge from the top of the slab to the bottom of the footing.
Slab-on-ground insulation options
The majority of slab heat loss is reduced by incorporating both vertical edge and under-slab insulation.
When adding under-footing insulation, the inner vertical edge of the footing must also be insulated to get the full benefit of the insulation. Under-footing insulation requires specific engineering design (SED).
Slab-on-ground insulation options with masonry veneer cladding
Vertical edge insulation is less effective for masonry veneer, as there is less slab edge to insulate and most heat loss occurs through the veneer/slab rebate. Combining vertical edge insulation with under-slab insulation is correspondingly much more effective.
Proprietary slab-on-ground floors
There is a wide range of proprietary insulated slab floor and raft foundation systems available. These offer a range of insulation options and levels of thermal performance. Many are outside the scope of the Acceptable Solution and will need to be consented as alternative methods.
Slab-on-ground floor insulation considerations
Consideration should be given to the following:
The type of insulation and its suitability for the location in the slab assembly.
Durability of exposed vertical slab edge insulation and any protective applied coatings associated with the protection/durability of the insulation.
Timber bottom plate structural connections relative to the thickness and construction details of vertical slab edge insulation – these require a specific minimum slab edge distances and the manufacturer’s specifications should be referred to in order to dimension to meet structural performance specifications.
The conditioned spaces and unconditioned spaces within the building and junctions between these spaces. A conditioned space may include an attached garage so the floors, walls and roof of the encapsulated areas need to meet the requirements of H1 and garage doors would need to be considered in the H1 compliance equations. Junctions between unconditioned spaces (such as garages) need to be considered at floors /walls and roof. If perimeter edge insulation is to be installed this may require SED.

Working out the spacing and capacity of bracing lines is an integral part of the design of timber-framed buildings
N ZS 3604:2011 Timber-framed Buildings sets out the requirements for bracing lines. Bracing lines are imaginary lines running along or across the full length or width of a timber-framed building. They have no physical significance, but are required to control the positioning of bracing elements.
Maximum and minimum spacing
The maximum spacing of bracing lines is:
6m apart in both directions for bracing elements at ground floor and above.
5m apart in both directions for subfloor.
Parallel bracing lines that are:
Less than 1m apart are considered to be a single line (see Figure 1).
Between 1 and 2m apart can be considered as single or separate lines (see Figure 2).
Over 2m apart are considered as separate lines.
This helps to evenly distribute the bracing and avoid concentrating it in one area.
No bracing lines in diaphragms
Diaphragms that comply with NZS 3604:2011 clause 5.6.1 require bracing lines on all four sides of the perimeter, but no bracing lines within the diaphragm. The maximum sizes of diaphragms in clause 5.6.1 are 12m long with an aspect ratio no greater than two. The aspect ratio is the length divided by the width; for example, a diaphragm measuring 12×6m or 8×4m has an aspect ratio of two.
Floor diaphragms should comply with clause 7.3 and ceiling diaphragms with clause 13.5.
External bracing lines
The minimum capacity of external bracing lines is the greater of:
100 bracing units (BUs).
15 BU/m of external wall length on the bracing line.
50% of the total demand divided by the number of bracing lines in the direction being considered (along or across).
Dragon ties
Dragon ties may be used with a braced wall system to permit a maximum room size of 7.5×7.5m. The dragon-tie fixing must be no more than 5m from the next inside bracing line (see Figure 3).
Walls with dragon ties attached to the top plate must have a bracing capacity of at least 100 BUs. Dragon ties can only be attached in pairs across corners. They must be no more than 2.5m from the corner and be a continuous piece of at least 90×35mm. For fixings, see NZS 3604:2011 clause 8.3.3.4. For more on dragon tie requirements, see clause 8.3.3.
Parallel external walls
Parallel external walls offset between 1 and 2m from each other may be treated as either one bracing line or as two separate lines (see Figure 4).
Internal bracing lines
The minimum capacity of internal bracing lines is the greater of:
100 BUs.
50% of the total demand divided by the number of bracing lines in the direction being considered (along or across).
Each internal bracing line can have bracing from either or both:
Wall bracing elements in the internal wall on the bracing line.
Pairs of wall bracing elements in internal walls up to 2m apart, one each side of the bracing line and parallel to it.

While Building Code changes and government subsidy schemes have focused on encouraging more insulation in new homes and retrofitting existing homes, there’s growing concern that poor installation is undermining the drive to improve housing performance.
Installing insulation incorrectly reduces its effectiveness at stopping heat loss. BRANZ fitted insulation to a wall panel and tested different-sized gaps. They found that R2.8 insulation with 16 mm gaps would only perform as well as R1.4 insulation. Even with gaps of just 4 mm, the R-value was reduced by 12-15%.
The danger is that if installation problems occur throughout the house, the cumulative effect on its thermal performance may mean it doesn’t meet the energy efficiency requirements of the Building Code, even if the correct R-value materials are used.
An audit of insulation fitted in new build homes, undertaken for the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority (EECA), provides worrying reading. None of the installations in the 58-house audit met the requirements of NZS 4246:2006 Energy Efficiency – Installing Insulation in Residential Buildings . This Standard provides a best practice guideline, in order to achieve good thermal performance.
Typical problems affecting the home’s thermal performance included:
Folds
Tucks
Gaps
Compressions
Missing insulation
Lack of insulation to the middle of the top plate
Other issues were the lack of a 25mm gap to the underside of the roof underlay, which has the potential to transfer condensation and moisture to the insulation, as well as significant safety faults through insulating over or around recessed downlights and electrical equipment.
The photographs (bottom left) show typical installation problems from a range of houses. Using a high-quality insulation product with a high R-value is important – but no matter which product you use, installation of that product is the key to good performance.
The Insulation Association of New Zealand has been formed to encourage better performance in the supply and installation of residential insulation. The Association has developed a training programme offering industry-specific training in site safety and on the key requirements of NZS 4246:2006 .
To get the best-quality installation for your clients, consider using a graduate of their training programme. You can find the names of graduates on the IAONZ website www.iaonz.co.nz
Alternatively, if you prefer to install insulation yourself, it could be worth taking the IAONZ training programme – you may be surprised how much you can learn about this important aspect of the builder’s craft.
After all, the better the installation, the warmer your clients will be in their new home and the lower their power bills, – all part of the ‘quality build’ process.
“Using a high-quality insulation product with a high R-value is important – but no matte which product you use, installation of that product is the key to good performance
Only insulate when moisture content of timber is less than 16%.
Fit insulation closely to framing – there should be no gaps around the outer edges of the segments and framing, or between butted joins.
Make sure there are no folds in the segments themselves.
Make sure there is no tucking.
Insulation material should not be compressed – it will not perform to its best.
Insulation materials should be dry and undamaged.
Leave a clear space of at least 25 mm between the insulation and roof or roof underlay.
Leave clearances around recessed downlights, unless they have an IC (insulated contact) rating.
Leave clearances around auxiliary control equipment, metal chimneys and flues.

Sufficient clearance between cladding and deck is essential for waterproof construction of a waterproof deck. Here are some tips to help you get it right
E 2/AS1 has some specific requirements that must be met for clearances between a cladding and a waterproof deck.
These include:
A maximum area of 40m².
A membrane upturn at the wall junction of at least 150mm.
Slope the membrane away from the wall.
Lapping the wall underlay over the membrane upstand.
A clearance of at least 35mm between the bottom of the cladding and the highest point on the deck surface.
For claddings installed over a cavity: Providing drainage from the cavity behind the cladding incorporating a cavity closure. Forming a drip edge (10–15mm depending on cladding type) along the bottom edge.
Providing drainage from the cavity behind the cladding incorporating a cavity closure.
Forming a drip edge (10–15mm depending on cladding type) along the bottom edge.
A step down to the waterproof surface at doorways of 100mm minimum (an alternative, not detailed in E2/AS1, is for a 100mm high threshold or step where the floor level and deck substrate are at the same level).
A minimum deck slope for drainage of 2°.
No finish adhered to the tiles – any additional walk-on or protective surface must be removable.
No downpipes discharging onto the deck.
In addition, it is considered good design of waterproof decks to:
Have a minimum of two drainage outlets, each with their own overflow.
Specify flood testing on completion.
Protect the membrane after it’s laid.

Fixings come in a variety of shapes, sizes and materials and play a critical role in a building’s durability – but it’s essential you select the right ones for the job!
Whether it’s a nail, screw, bolt or bracket – fixings are what hold buildings together. There are a number of factors to consider when selecting fixings, as well as rigorous standards that must be met. NZS 3604:2011 Timber-framed buildings Section 4.4 and E2/AS1 Section 9 and Tables 20–22 are the primary references.
Environment – whether in a wet or dry, benign or corrosive, hidden or closed, sheltered or exposed area.
Local micro-climatic conditions – these may be quite unique.
Compatibility/suitability of the fixing with the materials being fixed.
For timber – acidity, treated or untreated, treatment type.
For metals – the level of applied corrosion protection or the galvanic scale determines metal compatibility.
Fixing type – zinc-plated steel, hot-dip galvanised steel, stainless steel, silicon bronze.
Where the fixing selected is not suitable for the materials being fixed, or the environment it is exposed to, the end result is premature deterioration of the fixing and loss of fixing performance.
Typically this shows as premature corrosion of the fixing leading to:
Loss of metal thickness within the fastener and, therefore, loss of strength and performance.
Deterioration of the timber around the corroding metal fixing.
Rust staining of surface finishes, where a cladding fixing corrodes.
Corrosion of a metal cladding around the fixing point.
Difficulty in extracting fixings, due to the onset of corrosion binding the fixing into the substrate.
NZS 3604 and fixings
NZS 3604:2011 Section 4.4 covering the durability of steel fixings and fastenings used with timber framing has specific requirements.
Table 4.1 for the protection required for steel fixings and fastenings excluding nails and screws
Table 4.2 for the galvanising of steel components other than nails and screws – the required galvanising coating rates are given
Table 4.3 for steel items such as nails and screws used for framing and cladding.
The key aspect when selecting fixings and fastenings to meet the requirements of NZS 3604:2011 are:
The exposure zone – in zone D, Table 4.1 requires all structural fixings in sheltered and exposed locations to be stainless steel (minimum grade 304).
The location of the fixing or fastening (Figures 4.3(a) and (b)): closed (within the building envelope and not subject to airborne salts and rain wetting), sheltered (open to airborne salts but not rainwashed), exposed (open to airborne salts and rain washing).
For subfloor fixings, the amount of subfloor ventilation.
How close any timber pile fixing is to the ground – structural fixings such as bolts within 600 mm of the ground must be stainless steel.
The notes to the tables require:
Stainless steel or copper, silicon bronze fixings when copper quaternary and copper azole timber treatments have been used in exposed or sheltered situations and galvanised fixings in closed situations.
Hot-dip galvanised can be used with external CCA-treated timber in exposure zones B and C and in exposure zone D for claddings that have not more than 15-year durability.
A minimum 5 mm steel thickness for fabricated steel brackets that are hot-dip galvanised – these brackets must be hot-dip galvanised after manufacture and can only be used in a sheltered location in exposure zones B or C.
E2/AS1 tables
E2/AS1 clauses 4.2.2 and 4.3 state that metals that are in contact in locations where they will become wet, or where water can flow over metals or certain plastics onto another metal, shall be selected in accordance with:
Table 20 for material selection – focuses primarily on metal claddings including fixings to these claddings.
Table 21 for compatibility of materials in contact.
Table 22 for compatibility of materials subject to run-off.
Tables 21 and 22 do not specifically mention cladding fixings, but they can give guidance on compatibility of fixings with the cladding chosen.
Key factors around claddings in Table 21 are avoiding contact between:
Stainless steel and hot-dip galvanised steel, aluminium alloy/zinc-coated steel or zinc.
Copper and hot-dip galvanised steel, aluminium alloy/zinc-coated steel or zinc.
Acidic cladding timbers (redwood and western red cedar) and hot-dip galvanised or zinc-plated steel.
Hot-dip galvanised steel, aluminium alloy/zinc-coated steel, zinc or anodised aluminium and copper azole and copper quaternary treatments.
Aluminium and stainless steel in exposure zone d except where the stainless steel element is small relative to the aluminium (using aluminium with stainless steel is permitted in exposure zones B and C).
E2/AS1 also has guidance on fixing selection in:
8.2.4 – materials for flashings, gutters and fixings shall be selected from Table 20 to minimise corrosion used with concrete tiles.
8.3.7 – fixings to metal tiles (50 × 2.8 mm hot-dip galvanised painted flathead annular- grooved nails).
8.4.8 – fixings for profiled metal roofing shall comply with class 4 of AS 3566 Part 2 as a minimum.
8.4.11.1 – fixing flashings to profiled metal roofing or to the structure.
9.1.10.8 – fixing in aluminium windows and doors (75 × 3.15 mm galvanised jolthead nails or 8 gauge × 65 mm stainless steel screws).
9.2.7 – brick veneer wall ties (12 gauge × 35 mm long hex washer face galvanised or stainless steel screws), see also E2/AS1 Table 18(c).
9.6.6 – fixings for profiled metal wall cladding (12 gauge hexagonal head screws complying with class 4 of AS 3566 Part 2 as a minimum).
9.6.7(e) – fixing of flashing junctions for corrugated and trapezoidal steel claddings.
9.9.4.1 – fixings for EIFS to be hot-dip galvanised nails together with appropriate washers.
If suitable fixings are selected, there should be no premature deterioration of the fixing and loss of fixing performance

With summer fast approaching, now is a good time to brush up on your deck building skills, as homeowners prepare for long evenings spent around the BBQ
An Acceptable Solution for deck construction is provided by NZS 3604:2011Timber-framed buildings. In this article, we’ll show you how to design and build an external open-slatted timber deck.
An L-shaped deck addition is proposed for an existing house. It will be 6.3m long in one direction, project 3.0m from the face of the building and have a total area of 21m² (see Figure 1). The finished deck level will be 100mm below the floor level of the house.
The requirements of foundations, subfloor framing, bracing, decking selection, fastenings and fixings can be found in NZS 3604 section 7.4.
The house is in earthquake zone 3 (NZS 3604 Figure 5.4). As there is no subsoil classification, E must be assumed and a multiplication factor of 1.0 (NZS 3604 clause 5.3.3 and Table 5.8) used for bracing calculations.
The section slopes away from the house, starting at approximately 1.0m below floor level adjacent to the house to approximately 2.0m below floor level at the edge of the deck.
Joists are to be cantilevered 900mm beyond the line of the piles and bearer (see Figure 1).
The building owner would like to use a 32mm Kwila decking, so joist spacing may be up to 600mm. However, as the deck is to support a cantilevered balustrade, NZS 3604 clause 7.4.1.3 requires that joists must be at 400 centres maximum and at least 190mm deep.
New Zealand Building Code clause B2 Durability sets out the durability requirements for building elements and cites NZS 3602:2003 Timber and wood-based products for use in building for timber treatment levels.
Generally, structural elements must have not less than 50-year durability, and stairs, handrails and decking require not less than 15-year durability. All structural fixings must have the same durability as the elements with which they are associated and will need to be stainless steel.
So, from NZS 3602: Table 1:
• Piles must be H5 treated (ground contact). • All other structural members – ie, bearers, stringer, braces, joists and safety barrier support posts –must be at least H3.2 treated (exposed to the exterior but not in ground contact).
NZS 3604 clause 2.3.2 requires SG8 (structural grade) timber for wet-inservice conditions.
Using the multiplication factor E for zone 3 = 1.0
15 BU/m² × 1.0 = 15 BU/m²
Paragraph 7.4.2.2 states that decks that project more than 2.0m from the building require subfloor bracing at half the bracing demand required by Table 5.8 for ‘light/light/light’ cladding, 0° roof pitch and for ‘subfloor structures’.
Divide the number of BUs required by two:
15 BU/m² / 2 = 7.5 BU/m² are required.
Multiply the number of BU/m2 by the area of the deck to obtain the total BUs required for the deck:
7.5 BU/m² × 21m² = 157.5 BUs in each direction.
Bracing may be provided by anchor, braced and cantilevered piles. NZS 3604 section 6 Brace pile gives the bracing capacity ratings of subfloor bracing elements. Both anchor and braced piles provide 120 BUs per bracing element.
However, as anchor piles may only be 600mm above ground level, and the ground level is 1.0–2.0m below the deck, anchor piles cannot be used.
Similarly, cantilevered piles may only extend 1.2m maximum above ground level and in addition provide only 30 BUs per pile, requiring more cantilevered piles to achieve the BUs needed.
Braced pile systems offer the best solution. As they provide 120 BUs for earthquake resistance, two braced pile systems are required in each direction.
Braces will be less than 3.0m long, so the brace size may be 100 × 75mm.
As the line of support (ie, piles and bearer) is 2.1m from the house, according to NZS 3604 Table 7.1(b) (2 kPa floor load and wet in service), 140 × 45mm joists may be used, and Table 7.2 for cantilevered joists allows a cantilever of up to 1150mm.
However, at the bottom of Table 7.2, a note states that 140mm joist depth is insufficient where cantilevered balustrades are to be used (as in this situation).
So, select the next size up: 190 × 45mm joists. At 400 centres, these may cantilever up to 1600mm.
Select bearers from NZS 3604 Table 6.4(b) (2 kPa floor load and wet in service).
To determine the loaded dimension of the bearers, refer to NZS 3604 Definitions.
From Figure 1.3(G), the loaded dimension = (span 1/2) + span 2 (where span 1 = 2.1m and span 2 = 900mm) = 2.1/2 + 900 = 1.95m
From NZS 3604 Table 6.4(b) (2 kPa floor load and wet in service):
For maximum bearer span = 1.3 and a loaded dimension of 2.3m, bearer = 140 × 70mm, or
For maximum bearer span = 1.65 and loaded dimension 2.7m, bearer = 190 × 70mm.
Use 140 × 70mm bearers with supports at 1.3m centres maximum.
Stringers will be used against the house.
Ideally, stringers should be packed off and fixed to the foundation wall.
Maximum joist span is 2.1m, so from NZS 3604 Table 6.5, the stringer may be either:
140 × 45mm or 190 × 45mm
Both will need bolt fixings at 1600mm centres.
A combination of ordinary and braced piles must be used. Select 140mm diameter timber piles.
For pile footings, use NZS 3604 Table 6.1.
For ordinary piles:
Maximum bearer span = 1.3m; maximum joist span = 2.1m.
Footings – 260mm diameter, 200mm minimum deep (NZS 3604 Figure 6.2).
For braced piles:
Two systems in each direction.
Footings – 400mm diameter, 450mm minimum deep (NZS 3604 clause 6.8.1.1).
When installing slatted timber decking, leave:
A 12mm minimum gap between the stringer and the decking.
A 12mm minimum gap between the cladding and the decking for drainage (E2/AS1 paragraph 7.1.1) – see Figures 3 and 4.
A 3–6mm gap between decking timbers lengthways (NZS 3604 recommends using a 100 × 3.75mm nail as a spacer) to allow timber movement due to moisture and temperature changes and for water to drain.

Builders are often asked to advise homeowners on fencing so this article may provide a useful starting point.
F ences, screens and walls are fundamental aspects of landscape design and construction, defining borders, creating spaces and providing various degrees of privacy and protection from the elements – here are some tips to help you overcome any fencing hurdles
If a fence is to be built on a common boundary, both neighbours are obliged to each contribute an amount equivalent to at least half the cost of a standard ‘reasonably satisfactory’ fence.
The proportion of the costs can only be claimed from a neighbor if prior written notice is given that a fence is going to be built and the neighbor is advised of the cost of the proposed fence.
Neighbours should be consulted in the first instance, but if an agreement can’t be reached over dividing the costs (or what constitutes a ‘reasonable standard’ of fence), there is a formal process that can be followed in which a non-cooperative neighbor is served with a Fencing Notice.
The notice must state that it is served under the Fencing Act 1978, must include the names and addresses of both parties involved and must be signed and dated. A template for such a notice is provided in the Fencing Act. The notice must also describe:
The boundary to be fenced.
The type of fence.
Who will build the fence.
The estimated cost.
How materials are to be purchased.
The start date for the work.
If a boundary fence issue can’t be resolved with tact and compromise, there are provisions in law involving notices and cross-objections that must be carried out in time frames as specified in the Fencing Act. If there is no agreement at the end of the processes described, options such as mediation, arbitration, the Disputes Tribunal or court proceedings will need to be further investigated.
Down the middle
The fence should be built with the posts centred on the boundary line or as near to it as practical.
Usually, a fence of up to 2m high can be built without the need of a resource or building consent, but the relevant territorial authority should be consulted for the rules specific to the locality.
A myriad of fencing options are available, from simple post and wire fences, to prefabricated metal or timber palings or lattice work, to walls of stone, brick or concrete block.
The requirements are that they:
Remain durable.
Are aesthetically pleasing.
Resist or deflect wind loads.
Comply with Resource Management Act requirements for the site in terms of heights.
For privacy, solid fences provide the greatest benefit, but for protection from the wind, the requirements are different.
Shelter from the storm
Fences that completely block the wind provide localised protection immediately adjacent to the fence, but create downwind turbulence. Angling the top or installing a strip of lattice across the top of the fence can reduce the turbulence.
For maximum shelter from wind, a fence should have about 40-50% of its face area open and be constructed with gaps – fewer at the base and increasing with height. Such a fence should provide a sheltered lee area with width of four to five times the height of the fence.
A fence constructed of offset horizontal planking or palings diffuses the wind as it passes through the fence. Even if the fence has more than 50% permeability, the effect of draughts are minimised because the wind cannot directly flow through the gaps.
Lattice fences have an even distribution of solid material and gaps to moderate the airflow, although they do not have the progressive increasing of open area recommended above. The approximate permeability of lattice fences is:
20mm lattice with 20mm apertures – 23%.
50mm lattice with 50mm apertures – 25%.
25mm lattice with 50mm apertures –42%.
Vertical paling or board fences provide greater protection from the wind when the gaps and palings are narrower and of similar sizes. Where wide palings are used, the wind that passes through the gaps will be more noticeable.
Windbreak fabrics can be fixed over wire or timber fences to provide additional wind protection. Such protection may be useful on a temporary basis until wind-tolerant planting is established.
In areas subject to frost, leave a small gap at the bottom of a fence or planting (particularly if there is a vegetable garden behind the fence) to avoid trapping cold air and to reduce the risk or severity of the frost.
Timber post and rail fences
Use H4-treated or naturally durable timber for all in-ground material. Using H4 treated timber (or equivalently durable timber) for the bottom rail of a fence is desirable where it is likely that the rail will be covered by or in contact with mulch.
Posts should be placed 100mm into the ground for every 300mm above ground.
Ensure the excavation is filled with rodded concrete (preferably) or thoroughly rammed earth – limiting fence height to 1m is recommended when rammed earth is used to fill post holes.
Keep timber rail spans smaller rather than larger. The longer the span, the greater the potential for sag in the complemented fence – for example, limit the span of a 100x50mm rail on edge to less than 2.4m.
Other factors to consider for timber-framed fences are:
Ensure fixings holding trellis panels together will be durable – staples should be stainless steel for external use.
Keep fibre-cement and profiled steel fence panels clear of the ground.
Select fittings such as gate hinges and catches that are durable – stainless steel fittings are preferable to zinc-plated fittings, which are not suitable for external use on treated timber.
Ensure the spans of fencing panels are in the limits set by the manufacturer – typically 600mm maximum for fibre-cement.
For profiled steel claddings:
Don’t use unfinished zinc/aluminium alloy-coated steel in corrosion zones D or E.
Ensure factory coatings are undamaged.
Use colour-matched fixings suitable for the corrosion zone.
Limit spans (supporting framing spacing) to 1200mm.
Avoid use where the surface will not be regularly cleaned by rain.
For fibre-cement:
Use hot-dip galvanised fixings in corrosion zones B and C and stainless steel in zones D and E.
Paint for durability.
Limit spans (supporting framing spacing) to 600mm.

Collecting rainwater for drinking can be practical, money-saving and sometimes simply necessary. If a customer approaches you about including this facility in a new build or renovation, it’s important for safety’s sake that systems are correctly set up and maintained
A n estimated 10% of New Zealanders obtain their drinking water from rainwater collected from the roof. If roof-collected water is clear and has little taste or smell, it’s generally safe to drink.
To ensure it’s safe and does not become contaminated, some precautions are necessary. It’s also important to remind homeowners to regularly check, clean and maintain the system and storage tank.
Take precautions to avoid contamination
To minimise the risk of rainwater contamination:
Ensure the roof surface is suitable for collecting potable water (water safe enough for drinking and food preparation).
Keep the roof clean and free of debris.
Keep the roof catchment area clear of overhanging branches (away from birds, rodents, possums).
Avoid installing a television aerial or any other fixtures that may provide roosting for birds.
Install mesh leaf guards over gutters (Figure 1).
Install leaf screens to downpipes (Figure 2).
Install a first-flush diverter to divert the first water from the gutter away from the storage tank (Figure 3 overleaf).
Install a finer filtration system to remove smaller particles that are not removed by the leaf guard and screening systems.
If spray drift is anticipated, disconnect the pipes and do not reconnect them until the roof has been well washed by rain.
Storage tanks
To reduce contamination in the storage tank:
Install a calmed water inlet system to reduce sediment disturbance during heavy rainfall.
Install the water intake near the water surface (where the water is likely to be cleanest) using a floating intake (Figure 4 overleaf).
Attach insect-proof screens or flap valves to the end of all pipes to keep insects out and ensure the tank is properly vented.
Install an air gap to the overflow outlet to prevent storm water backflow into the tank.
Keep access covers closed to prevent access into the tank by insects, pests or debris.
If the storage tank is below ground, ensure that surface run-off from areas other than the roof catchment cannot get into the tank.
Leave a new roof for at least one good rainfall before connecting downpipe to the storage tank.
A few ‘do nots’
Collected water cannot be used for drinking if it has been in contact with:
Uncoated lead flashings – lead flashings on existing roofs should be coated with suitable paint (coated lead paint is available for new roofs).
Treated timber – chemicals leaching out might contaminate the water.
Asbestos – although asbestos is no longer used in new building work, existing asbestos roofs should not be used for collecting rainwater.
Bitumen, lead-based and other paints that do not meet required water quality standards.
Water catchment system
The water catchment system comprises the roof, gutters, downpipes, water storage tank and the pipework connecting the two.
Downpipes may be open – ie, they can easily be disconnected if required (such as for roof cleaning or if contamination of water occurs) – or sealed if the pipework remains full of water and cannot be easily disconnected.
Roofing materials
Roofs suitable for water collection for human consumption must meet the requirements of AS/NZS 4020:2005 Testing of products for use in contact with drinking water and may include:
Unpainted zinc/aluminium alloy-coated or galvanised (zinc) steel.
Factory-coated or painted zinc/aluminium alloy-coated or galvanised steel.
Zinc.
Stainless steel.
Aluminium.
Concrete or clay tiles.
Untreated timber shingles – usually imported western red cedar.
Butyl rubber.
Asphalt shingles.
Bitumen membranes.
Always check with the manufacturer.
Tank materials
Tanks and pipework used for storing drinking water, even if only in an emergency, must be made from materials complying with AS/NZS 4020:2005 .
Water tanks can be made of galvanised steel, zincalume (only if not in ground contact), fibreglass, plastic and concrete. When new, they may sometimes affect the taste of water.
A galvanised tank, for example, may initially cause a metallic taste, or a new concrete tank may release lime that increases the pH of the water and cause a slightly bitter taste.
The taste generally diminishes over time, and if the tank and pipework materials meet the requirements of AS/NZS 4020:2005 , they do not present a health hazard.
Filtration systems
Filtration systems can be either:
A point-of-use system, where the filter is attached to the inlet supply, a tap or plumbed in with a dedicated faucet.
A point-of-entry system, which is a centrally installed system to treat all water.
A range of filters are available, including:
Mesh filters, including polyester, of various sizes to remove different types of particles.
Carbon filters.
Reverse osmosis filters.
UV sterilisers to kill bacteria.
Ideally, a filtration system should include several different types of filters.
First-flush diverter
First-flush diverters prevent the first rainfall – containing dirt, debris and contaminants from the roof – from entering the storage tank by diverting it into a separate chamber (see Figure 3).
Once this chamber is full, the water feeds into the storage tank. There are different size chambers: the larger the roof area, the more rainwater initially has to be flushed away from the storage tank, so the larger the chamber must be.
First-flush diverters are designed to empty themselves, but they should be checked regularly and emptied if necessary.
Inspect regularly and maintain
It is very important that system inspections and maintenance are carried out regularly. BRANZ recommends the following timetable:
Every 3-6 months
Inspect and clean gutters.
Before cleaning, disconnect pipes that feed the storage tank if possible.
At least every 12 months
Check the roof, remove debris and prune overhanging branches.
Check tank inlets, mesh covers and leaf filters, and clean and repair as necessary.
Check the exterior of the tank and pipes for structural integrity, leaks and seepage.
Check for evidence of access by animals or insects, the presence of algal growth and accumulated sediment.
Tank cleaning
If the tank needs cleaning, it should be emptied, sediment removed, scrubbed and rinsed with clean water. Ideally, professional tank cleaners should be engaged.
Sediment should be removed when required. This can be done without emptying the tank by siphoning, pumping, using a scour valve (if the tank has one) or by using a swimming pool vacuum cleaner.
Disinfecting storage tanks and pipelines
Tanks and pipework should be disinfected every 18-24 months to reduce algal growth, using hydrogen peroxide or a household bleach containing sodium hypochlorite or calcium hypochlorite. Another method of treating water is with UV light.
Roof maintenance and painting
Roofs used as water catchments must not be painted with lead or chromium-based paints.
Most modern roof paints are labelled for their suitability if the roof is to be used as a water catchment, but always ask the manufacturer if you’re unsure.
The roof should be cleaned annually. Pipes to the water storage tank must be disconnected beforehand, so the water can be flushed away.

Almost all building materials move of their own accord. Design and construction must allow for this, or it can affect material durability and even weather-tightness. Here are some points to consider
There are four main types of movement:
Moisture movement, when a material absorbs and releases moisture.
Thermal movement, from temperature changes over the day and year.
Permanent shrinkage, from materials curing or drying.
Settlement, creep, flexing and deflection.
Materials that absorb and release moisture (such as timber, concrete, cement plaster, mortars and concrete masonry) move as surrounding moisture levels change. Materials can shrink and expand repeatedly, except for wood fibreboard, which swells when wet, but won’t return to its original dimensions on drying.
How much movement occurs depends on the material, the degree to which environmental conditions change and how the material is finished, installed or protected.
All materials expand when heated and contract when cooled, some more than others. Materials that have significant thermal movement (listed in decreasing severity) include:
Metals: lead, zinc, aluminium, brass, austenitic stainless steel, copper, mild steel, ferritic stainless steel, cast iron – this is why E2/AS1 limits the lengths of some flashings.
Plastics: polyethylene, polypropylene, polycarbonate, acrylic, PVC, GRP. Thermal movement is relatively small for most other materials.
The amount of movement is influenced by:
Daily and annual temperature ranges – a material’s surface temperature will typically be more (or less) than the air temperature.
Location – north and west-facing materials get hotter and move more than those facing south.
Amount of shading.
Material colour – darker colours get hotter so will expand more.
Length – the longer the element, the greater the expansion and contraction that must be accommodated.
Shrinkage from curing is permanent. Materials that demonstrate this include:
Concrete.
Concrete masonry.
Cement plaster, such as stucco.
Cement mortars.
Adhesives.
Timber as it dries down from its fibre saturation point.
Initial drying of timber is as a result of water being lost from within the cells. Once water starts being lost from the cell walls (the fibre saturation point is around 30% moisture content for most timbers), shrinkage will occur.
These types of movement occur from:
Applied loads, such as live load deflection or vibration.
Creep, where the material moves under applied loads but does not recover.
Earthquakes or settlement, which may result in permanent damage.
Movement can be minimised by ensuring:
Spans of bearers, beams, lintels, floor joists, rafters and wall studs are within appropriate limits.
Live and dead loads and spans are within design limits.
Buildings are well-founded on good ground – potential liquefaction has been designed for and fill has been properly compacted.
Expansive clays are identified and foundations designed appropriately.
The design is appropriate for wind and earthquake loadings.
Thermal movement can be reduced by:
Providing shading to reduce solar heating.
Finishing with a light colour.
Not insulating immediately behind the materials.
Limiting length.
Moisture movement can be reduced by:
Coating the material and maintaining the coating.
Protecting the material from wetting.
Using non-absorbent material.
Typical strategies used to accommodate movement include:
Using expansion joints.
Over-drilling fixing holes.
Using slotted fixing holes.
Providing clearances or gaps between elements/materials (figure 1).
Using sliding clips (figure 2).
Overlapping materials to create a sliding joint.
Using single fixing for materials such as timber weatherboards.
Using properly designed sealant joints and using the right sealant for the materials and expected amount of movement.

The Building Code has precise requirements for the installation and location of gully traps. As well as locating and building them correctly, make sure any decks and other structures built over top allow access for cleaning
Gully traps are part of the foul water drainage system receiving discharge from kitchen, bathroom (apart from toilet pans) and laundry wastewater fixtures before it enters the sewer system.
They are located externally to ensure that, if the drainage system becomes blocked, the wastewater will overflow outside instead of inside the building. Gully traps include a water seal to block odours from the sewer.
Building code requirements
Installation of sanitary plumbing and drainage systems in New Zealand must be in accordance with New Zealand Building Code clause G13 Foul water.
Figure 1: Gully
Compliance with clause G13 can be achieved by meeting the requirements of Acceptable Solution G13/AS2 or AS/NZS 3500 Plumbing and drainage.
Select one document for compliance — do not mix and match requirements from both. Both documents cover below-ground foul drains up to 150mm in diameter, and neither cover the discharge of industrial, chemical or toxic waste.
Every dwelling needs one
Every residential building must have at least one gully trap, with at least one wastepipe discharging into it so that the water seal is retained.
A single-fixture discharge pipe must not be more than 3.5m in length (G13) between the water seal of the fixture and the gully trap, unless it is vented.
A number of discharge pipes may drain into a single gully trap.
Requirements for gully traps
Waste pipes may discharge into a gully trap from the top through the grating or through the back of the chamber.
The pipe connection must be watertight so groundwater cannot enter the sewer system.
Any deck above must allow access
Figure 2: Gully trap dimensions and requirements
Gully traps must be accessible for cleaning and maintenance. A deck may be built over a gully trap, but at least 600mm of clear access space above the trap must be provided. This is for access to the gully trap and drainage inspection points.
Installing a gully trap
When installing a gully trap, it must be adequately supported by either:
Being set in compacted bedding material such as granular, noncohesive fill that has a maximum particle size of 20mm.
75mm thick concrete surrounding the entire gully dish and separated from the building foundation.
Note: While drainage pipes can be run under a slab (Build 157, page 24), it may be prudent, if sufficient fall is available, to run them around the building’s perimeter for ease of maintenance.

Wall underlay plays a crucial role in the weathertightness of timber-framed houses – if it’s not installed properly, water that gets through the cladding and underlay can reach the framing and insulation
Poorly fitted underlay is a more common problem than you might think – 200 houses under construction were inspected in 2014, with loose wall underlay on half of them.
While cladding will always be the first line of defence against water, in extreme situations the underlay may be called on to provide a backup where the cladding is installed over a cavity. For a direct-fixed cladding, it is likely at some time in the life of the building that water will be in contact with the wall underlay. Underlay must be installed to allow water to flow downwards and around any penetrations without reaching the framing or insulation.
Properly installed wall underlay also helps prevent excessive air movement through the wall. This means the air in bulk insulation remains still, and the insulation does its job. With a cavity, underlay also helps keep the insulation in place and maintains the cavity space.
Options in E2/AS1 are a flexible wall underlay, or a rigid underlay that has a flexible underlay installed over it. Proprietary rigid air barriers, which provide the same function, are outside the scope of E2/AS1 but commonly consented as an Alternative Solution.
Flexible wall underlay installation sequence in cavity construction
Use only one wall underlay product on a building.
Install the wall underlay horizontally over the framing. Start from 10–15mm below the bottom plate and carry it up to the top of the top plate. Lap a higher layer over the lower layer by 150mm. Fix securely to studs and dwangs so the underlay is taut across the framing.
At the end of runs and on gable walls, laps should be made vertically with a 150mm end lap over studs. Tape vertical joins.
Trim openings by cutting at 45° away from the corners and folding the underlay around the framing.
Apply flexible flashing tape to the opening.
Where they are used, fix vertical battens (except above openings) following E2/AS1 . Use a continuous horizontal closer batten across the top of the wall and a slotted cavity closer along the bottom.
If battens are at centres wider than 450mm, fix additional battens vertically from the top to bottom plate at mid-stud to hold the underlay against the framing. Alternatively, install horizontal tapes or wires at 300mm maximum centres. This helps prevent the underlay from bridging the cavity after bulk insulation is installed, maintaining cavity drainage and ventilation paths.
Install penetrations (pipes, wiring and so on) and seal carefully with flexible tape.
The wall underlay must be as weathertight as possible before the building is closed in. Damage to underlay will significantly reduce its in-service performance. Repair any cuts and tears, and replace damaged underlay before windows, doors and cladding are installed.
In some cases, wall underlay is used to give protection to the building under construction and will be exposed for several weeks. Fix it to withstand wind pressure, rain and UV exposure. Do not go beyond the manufacturer’s maximum exposure time – commonly 30 or 60 days.

A s of 10 April, the new version of Building Code Clause C/AS1– Protection from fire – must be used in new building consent applications. A new version of the Acceptable Solution has been developed, which is intended to be simpler to apply and has a reduced scope of buildings and features.
The new Acceptable Solution is separated into seven individual solutions, which each cover a specific risk group. Acceptable Solution C/AS1 applies to Risk Group SH – detached or single houses, townhouses and multi-unit dwellings no more than two units high.
Additional background information is supplied for all seven documents.
Here are some of the key requirements in C/AS1 for Risk Group SH:
Where only a domestic fire alarm is fitted, the maximum allowable distance for an escape route with a single direction of escape is 25 m.
Each household unit, including any garage and escape routes in multi-unit dwellings, shall have fire separation from other household units. (An attached granny flat is considered a separate household unit and must have a fire separation between it and the main dwelling.)
Any escape routes with required fire separations must have a rating of 30 minutes – that is, the system has been shown in tests to remain standing and prevent flames, hot gases and heat getting through for at least 30 minutes. (The manufacturer will have information on what systems have been tested and have achieved this rating.)
Sprinkler systems are not mandatory, but where they are voluntarily included in the design of the building, there are reductions in some requirements.
Except where the building is protected with a sprinkler system, external walls shall give the same 30-minute minimum protection described above in: – Houses and side-by-side multi-unit dwellings, if the external wall is less than 1 m from the boundary. – Any other multi-unit dwellings, where the external wall is less than 5 m from the boundary.
There are specific rules where foamed plastics or exposed combustible insulating materials form part of a wall, ceiling or roof system.
C1/AS1 also has sections on recessed downlights and chimneys for open fires.
Clause 7.1.2 of the new version modifies AS/NZS 2918:2001 Domestic solid fuel burning appliances – Installation (which is an Acceptable Solution for the installation of these appliances).
Detailed information on the changes is available at www.dbh.govt.nz/compliance-documents .
All new houses and those undergoing alterations that require a consent must have smoke alarms installed – at least one alarm on or near the ceiling on each level of a household unit.
Smoke alarms should be either in every bedroom or within 3 m of every bedroom door. The alarms must be loud enough for people to hear through closed doors.
The alarms don’t need to be hardwired or interconnected, but the Fire Service recommends that this is done. With interconnected alarms, when one detects a fire, all the alarms in the house go off.
Hardwired means the alarms are connected to mains power, which makes them more reliable (although they still have a battery back-up that will need replacing occasionally).
BRANZ recommends installing smoke alarms in every house, even in houses not being renovated or where renovations do not require a consent.
Changes like these will be taken into consideration by the designer and integrated into the design. That’s why it’s important not to change any aspect of the design or substitute one product for another unless you’ve checked with the designer.

Exposed to the elements, aged timber decks frequently need repairs to stay looking good and remain safe to use. Regular maintenance may include replacing rotten boards, fixing nails that have popped, and removing moss and mould
Exposure to weather conditions means that timber decks are particularly vulnerable to deterioration. The repeated wetting and drying, combined with exposure to UV light and temperature changes, causes the boards to continuously swell and shrink and puts a great deal of stress on the timber and fasteners.
Common problems
The most common problems with timber decks are generally due to poor material selection, design and construction or age. Nails pop, boards splinter or become cracked, warped or cupped, fixings corrode and timber rots.
Most problems occur in decks where the timber is unable to dry in between periods of wetting.
These include:
Decking becoming slippery and stained due to moss or mildew growth
Decking becoming spongy or springy, sagging, bouncing or developing holes
Fixings corroding, particularly in coastal environments.
If decks are over 1m above ground, complex or severely deteriorated, seek professional advice first – a specialist may be required to undertake this work safely.
Rot in the timber
Continuously damp timber will rot.
In timber decks, rot occurs most often where moisture is trapped, such as:
If there is no drainage gap between decking and the wall cladding.
Where the decking crosses the joists.
Where the stringer is fixed over the wall cladding to the building with no drainage gap.
At the base of veranda or balustrade posts.
Rot may also originate in the subfloor framing from where it spreads up into the decking timber.
To test for rot, insert an awl, a knife blade or a screwdriver into the timber. If it slides in easily, the timber is rotten.
Rotten decking timber must be removed either by cutting out the rot and treating the remaining timber with timber preservative or replacing the rotten boards with H3.2 boards (minimum). When replacing rotten decking, the subfloor framing timber should also be checked for rot.
Repairing decks
Repair options for timber decks include:
Cleaning the deck to remove moss and mildew or staining.
Making localised, minor repairs such as:
Refastening nails that have popped or replacing popped nails with screws.
Refixing boards that are cupped or warped or have become loose.
Replacing damaged boards.
Improving deck drainage between decking and wall cladding, decking and joists or wall cladding and stringer.
Replacing corroded fixings.
Extensive repair work such as replacing the decking – refer to BRANZ Good Repair Guide Timber decking.
Repairing damaged subfloor framing – refer to BRANZ Good Repair Guide Subfloor timber.
Cleaning the deck to remove moss and mildew
If using a proprietary deck cleaning solution, follow the manufacturer’s instructions.
Alternatively, remove moss and mildew with a scrubbing brush, detergent and hot water, and a bleach solution if required, as follows:
Scrub the boards thoroughly, using detergent and hot water, ensuring that the grooves in the decking and the gaps between the boards are also scrubbed. Rinse off thoroughly and leave to dry.
If the decking is badly stained, use bleach to clean it. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for the ratio of bleach to water and check that it will not damage the timber before fully applying. Apply the bleach solution, using a brush or a sponge. Leave for approximately 15 minutes before rinsing off thoroughly and leaving to dry.
When using bleach:
Wear protective clothing, such as rubber gloves and safety goggles.
Use an oxygen bleach rather than a chlorine bleach, as oxygen bleach is less harmful to plants and the environment than chlorine bleach, which is toxic to vegetation, harmful to the environment and corrosive to metal fixings.
Avoid using a high-pressure water spray, such as a water blaster, as the high-pressure water raises the timber fibres, resulting in splinters of timber.
Refastening popped nails
Timber movement due to temperature changes will often cause nails to pop or protrude from the boards.
The nails can be rehammered but this is likely to be a temporary solution, as timber movement will most likely cause the nails to pop again.
Instead, replace the nails with slightly longer and thicker nails that will have a better hold in the timber. The replacements should be annular grooved type 304 stainless steel nails.
Alternatively, replace nails with type 304 stainless steel screws.
Refixing cupped, warped or loose boards
If cupping of boards is shallow, a plane or belt sander can be used to sand down the high edges. Alternatively, depending on the degree of cupping, boards can be turned over and refastened.
If the cupping is significant, boards generally need to be replaced.
Replacing sections of damaged boards
Where there is localised damage to boards, the damaged sections should be removed and replaced as follows:
Identify the sections of board requiring removal and mark lines adjacent to or across the centre of joists beyond the extent of the rot or damage. If the timber has rot, make sure that the cutting line is at least 1m beyond the visible rot to ensure that it is completely removed.
Use a circular or oscillating saw to cut through the decking timber. Cut through each board as required on both marked lines.
For boards that have been nail-fastened, use a pry bar and a timber block to pry against, if necessary, to remove the cut section of the decking. Do not pry against undamaged decking.
For boards that have been screw-fastened, remove screws using an electric screwdriver and a screw extractor as required.
Remove all splintered timber and debris.
Cut a replacement board (minimum H3.2) to length and fit into the gap, where each section of board has been removed.
Predrill holes for nails or screws if replacement boards are hardwood.
Nail or screw-fasten each into place with two fastenings at each end and two fastenings to each intermediate joist.
When cutting directly over the centre of a joist, care must be taken to avoid nails or screws from the original installation. If it is too difficult to remove the section of the board over the joist without damaging the saw, cut the board at the edge of the joist. Nail a block to the side of the joist to provide a nailing surface for the new board to be installed (see Figure 1).
Figure 1: fixing support blocks to joists
Improving deck drainage
Rot to decking timber, joists or wall cladding is likely to be due to poor drainage where components intersect such as between decking and wall cladding, decking and joists or wall cladding and stringer.
Between decking and wall cladding
Improve the drainage between decking and wall cladding, create a gap between the decking and the cladding:
Remove the decking board closest to the wall cladding and cut a minimum 12mm piece off the edge of the board.
Replace the board, leaving a 12mm gap between the edge of the board and the cladding.
If the existing board cannot be reused, replace it with a matching decking timber (minimum H3.2), leaving a 12mm gap between the edge of the board and the cladding.
Between decking and joists
Insufficient drainage between the decking timber and the top of the joists may be because the decking timbers do not have enough gap between adjacent boards, restricting free drainage.
The only way to fix this problem is to remove and replace the decking timbers. Reinstall the reused or new decking boards, allowing a 3-6mm gap between boards for drainage.
Between wall cladding and stringer
If there is rot in either the cladding and/or the stringer where they abut, there may be no gap to allow water to drain away. Create a gap between the cladding and the stringer:
Install a temporary bearer under the floor joists close to the stringer and supported with hydraulic jacks. The temporary bearer should be at least the same depth as the stringer.
Slowly jack up the temporary bearer by raising each jack approximately 5mm in turn until the bearer has been raised enough to remove the load from the stringer and provide access to cut through joist fastenings.
Cut through nails fixing joists to the stringer using a hacksaw.
Unfasten the bolts attaching the stringer to the wall and remove the stringer.
If there is rot in the weatherboards, the affected boards will need to be replaced – refer to BRANZ Good Repair Guide Horizontal timber weatherboards.
Insert H3.2 treated, 150 × 12mm thick packers (or UV-resistant 12mm plastic washers) with holes the same diameter as the bolt fixings at each bolt fixing.
If the stringer can be reused, re-bolt the stringer to the wall over the packers.
If the stringer cannot be reused, fix a new stringer to the wall over the packers. The stringer should be H3.2 treated timber and either 190 × 45mm or 140 × 45mm depending on joist spans and bolt spacings. See NZS 3604:2011 Timber-framed buildings section 6.13.
Refasten the joists to the stringer.
Remove the jacks and temporary beam. (See Figure 2).
Figure 2: connection of deck stringer to cladding – cavity
Replacing corroded fixings
Fixings that have corroded lose strength and should be replaced.
Corrosion may also cause staining of timber around the nails. While this is not a structural problem, if visually unacceptable, the staining can only be removed by replacing boards.
Extensive repair work such as deck replacement
If decking timber is in poor condition generally, the best solution may be to remove and replace it. Grooved or ridged decking timber should be laid with the grooved side down so that air can circulate where the boards are in contact with the joists.

The basic function of residential pavements such as driveways, paths and patios is to provide safe, easy access onto or around a property. Concrete is typically used to not only provide a durable paving surface (sloped, to provide surface water run-off) but one which can also incorporate a wide range of decorative finishes to complement the design and landscaping of the residence.
While providing a concrete pavement on the ground is relatively straightforward, there are a number of design and construction aspects that need to be considered in order to produce a finished product that satisfies the functional and aesthetic requirements of the homeowners.
The use of steel reinforcement or mesh does not increase the load capacity of the pavement, or affect its thickness. Its function is mainly to hold tightly closed any shrinkage cracks that may form. In general, the amount of reinforcement required to provide the appropriate degree of crack control will depend on the thickness of the slab, the joint spacing and the resistance to the slab shrinkage between joints.
For a 75 mm-thick footpath, which typically would have closely spaced joints (up to 3 m) – and hence little risk of cracking – either no reinforcement or a 668 mesh is generally appropriate.
For 100 mm-thick pavements with joints spaced further apart (up to 5 m), 665 mesh would typically be used.
For 150 mm thick pavements, use 663 mesh.
The construction of driveway pavements without reinforcing mesh is not recommended.
Mesh is typically based on a 150 mm square grid; however, mesh based on a 300 x 300 mm grid is also available, allowing the placers to walk between the mesh rods rather than on the mesh itself.
Note: slab construction requiring building consent requires Grade 500E (ductile) reinforcing mesh.
In some cases, increasing the minimum reinforcement would be recommended. For example, where decorative finishes are required, increasing the mesh size by one or even two sizes will provide better control of cracking that may occur, so that it does not significantly affect the appearance.
All standard concrete shrinks during the drying out phase. This starts at the end of the curing period and will continue until the moisture content stabilises with the ambient conditions, which may take many months. While the key elements that determine the amount of shrinkage are the type and quantities of materials used in the concrete mix – particularly water, cement and aggregate – it is not possible to design a mix that will avoid slab shrinkage altogether.
Cracks observed within one to two days are not caused by the long-term drying of hardened concrete; they are caused by premature drying of plastic concrete or by ‘early age’ thermal movements. These are primarily issues that need control during the construction phase.
When shrinkage strain causes stresses to exceed the tensile strength of the concrete slab, then the slab will crack. In practice, there is likely to be a combination of linear shrinkage between free joints and curling effects.
Curling is caused by the differential shrinkage within the depth of the slab, ie the top dries out faster than the bottom of the slab. With the top shortening more than the bottom, the slab will try to curl upwards at any edges or joints. At free joints, concrete on each side of the joint can move relative to one another.
The classic design for shrinkage in a concrete ground slab relates to allowing the shrinkage movements to take place and controlling the positions of where the movement is allowed to occur. This process is influenced by the following:
(a) Ground friction . If the interface between the concrete slab was frictionless, then the phenomenon of the concrete shrinkage would not cause any stress build up. Friction can be reduced by placing polyethylene sheeting or a 20 mm thick layer of sand under the slab.
(b) Construction features that cause a constraint to movement. For example: slabs tied to foundations internal or external, or changes in direction of the slab. Such construction features need to be isolated to allow the slab to move independently of them.
Joints typically form a weakened plane at which the concrete cracks. Without them, drying shrinkage will result in random cracking. Joints should be provided at maximum 5 m centres, depending on the reinforcement, and at any changes in shape (eg a narrow path attached to a driveway), at any changes in direction (eg around corners, especially where a re-entrant corner may be formed), and at any rigid structures (eg access holes, pits, columns) that may prevent movement and increase the risk of cracking.
Free movement joints should be placed at maximum 15 m centres to allow the pavement on each side to move independently of each other.
Double car driveways require a longitudinal joint splitting the driveway.
Wherever possible, the location of joints should be planned. A typical layout of joints in the paving to a residence is shown in Figure 1. Note that one aim should be to make the concrete panels defined by joints roughly square in shape. The ratio of length to width should not exceed 1.7:1. For decorative work, joints should, if possible, be located to suit the proposed decorative pattern or finish.
With all joint types, the angles formed at edges and intersections of joints should not be too acute, as this increases the risk of cracking and/or breaking off the tapered section of concrete. A good detail in these situations is to keep at least 500 mm of the joint at more than 75° (and preferably at right angles) to the slab edge.
Pavements generally have to meet two independent tolerance criteria: the ‘flatness’ of the surface and ‘levelness’ or variation from the designed elevation. Both of these should be specified.
The flatness tolerance gives the permitted variation from a 3 m straightedge placed on the surface. For hand-placed pavements, a reasonable flatness tolerance is a maximum deviation or gap of 5 mm under a 3 m straightedge placed anywhere on the pavement, including on slopes. The maximum abrupt deviation anywhere on the surface shall be 5 mm.
The levelness tolerance gives the permitted variation of the slab surface from a fixed external reference point or datum. A reasonable tolerance for the surface of a newly-constructed pavement would be ±10 mm from the designed level or elevation. Note that the nominal slab thickness should not be compromised by tolerance variations.

TITLE   : Penetrations in existing walls

When a penetration is required through the cladding of an existing building, effective sealing and weatherproofing is more difficult than when a penetration is incorporated during construction
F or new construction, guidance on sealing and weatherproofing penetrations through external wall claddings is provided in the Acceptable Solution E2/AS1 to NZBC clause E2 External moisture.
Many things require new penetrations and occasionally a penetration may need to be made through an existing wall cladding. Examples include:
Installing a heat pump, clothes dryer or range hood.
New plumbing or drainage pipes.
TV, phone or data cabling.
In these situations, effective sealing and weatherproofing is more difficult to achieve.
Minimise the risk
Things can be done, however, to mitigate the risk of water and air leakage created by penetrations through existing wall claddings.
Removing cladding is best, but difficult. If possible, the best solution is to remove enough of the external cladding to be able to access and fully seal the wall underlay around the penetration – in accordance with E2/AS1 .
This is often not feasible. When a penetration must be made through external wall cladding, locate the penetration where possible in a sheltered position such as:
Immediately under or through the eaves.
Under a veranda or porch.
On the sheltered side of the building.
If it is not possible to locate an outlet in a sheltered part of the building, the penetration should be protected by a cowl or shield. By reducing the amount of water passing over the penetration, the risk of water entering the opening is also reduced.
Slope opening to the exterior
Drill upwards from the exterior when cutting a penetration through the exterior cladding, so that any water that gets in the hole is able to drain out again (see Figure 1). The CANZ publication CP 01:2014 Code of practice for weathertight concrete and concrete masonry construction recommends that a penetration through an external wall has a minimum downward slope of 1.5° to the exterior.
Seal around pipe penetrations
Pipes through a penetration should be firmly fixed, so the pipe does not move within the opening. Apply sealant over a PEF backing rod around the opening, cover with a flange and seal around the top two-thirds of the flange collar (see Figures 1 and 2).
Do not apply sealant to the flange sleeve, as the sleeve will allow any water that gets past the flange to drain to the outside. As well as protecting against water entry, the flange will also protect the sealant around the opening from UV radiation or weathering. Seal around pipes or sleeves where they penetrate interior linings.
Install cabling in a conduit
Cabling and other flexible materials may be subjected to wind movement. This is likely to cause any sealant around the opening to be damaged and eventually fail.
Installing all cabling and flexible material in a conduit when retrofitting through existing cladding means the conduit can be sealed and flanged in the same way as the rigid pipe penetration. Where wires are not in a conduit:
Drill upwards through the cladding.
Protect with an exterior deflector sealed to cladding.
Relocating meter boxes
If a meter box needs to be relocated to the outside of the building, rivet a 30×30mm angle to all sides of the meter box and flash over the angle along the top edge in a similar way to the solution shown in E2/AS1 Figure 68 . Alternatively, a relocated meter box may be installed behind a window panel so it is isolated completely from the weather.
When to avoid penetrations
Avoid penetrations through a flat or low-pitched roof or deck, as these are more difficult to waterproof. If a penetration is required, another location for the penetration should be found.
Retrofitting heat pump pipework
Figures 3(a)-(d) show the installation of heat pump pipework into an existing house. The penetration for the pipework through the external cladding is high on the external wall and is under a veranda. The hole is filled with sealant around the pipework. The proprietary cover has sealant applied to the top edges while the bottom is left open to allow any water that may get in to drain out again.

The easy-reference guides published by the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) are titled Below-Floor Work and Above-Floor Work . They provide an introduction to the more detailed technical guidance published by MBIE for repairs and rebuilds in the Canterbury green zone (land suitable for rebuilding).
Even though you may be an experienced builder, repairing a post-earthquake building is different from carrying out day-to-day repairs.
For example, floor structures may have been twisted, wrenched, cracked or tilted so much that foundation repair, re-levelling or replacements must be considered before other repairs are done.
Even though you may be an experienced builder, repairing a post-earthquake building is different from carrying out day-to-day repairs
Or, if wall frames are damaged in earthquakes, it may mean structural fixings have come loose or whole walls have been dislodged or moved out of plumb.
The MBIE technical guidance divides the residential Green Zone into three technical categories, which are a guide to the level of site investigation required and options for the appropriate foundation systems for a home with foundation damage.
For example, in Technical Category 3 (TC3), where liquefaction damage is possible in future large earthquakes, house foundations requiring repair or replacement will require geotechnical advice and design input from a chartered professional engineer. This is to ensure the repair or reconstruction of the foundations is appropriate for the site.
In the other Technical Category areas (TC1 and TC2), repairs to house foundations can generally be done without specific engineering design.
This booklet has diagrams to help builders assess foundation damage and check ground height requirements, as well as checklists of things to consider when repairing foundations or lifting and re-levelling floors.
There is a table of foundation options, with references to the detailed MBIE guidance, and another table giving recommended cladding weights for buildings depending on the type of foundation and the Technical Category.
This focuses on structural repair work covered in the MBIE guidance, which includes repairs to wall and roof framing and bracing, repairs to cladding, chimney and fireplace repairs, and repairs to retaining walls.
There is a useful table summarising MBIE’s recommended repairs for plaster-board or plywood-braced panels and a table and diagrams to assist with chimney repairs.
Above-Floor Work also advises that retaining walls on hillside properties, which have been damaged by earthquakes, can be difficult to repair. It advises that, in most cases, specialist engineering advice will be required before making substantial repairs or replacements to retaining walls.
Both provide references to relevant sections in the more detailed MBIE technical guidance.
The booklets also briefly cover builders’ legal responsibilities regarding relevant documents; the Building Code, the agreed contract and building consents. It is the builders’ responsibility to ensure that the building work complies with the building consent, the agreed contract, and, where the building work is not covered by a building consent, complies with the Building Code.
The booklets also include two important reminders:
• That structural work on dwellings is Restricted Building Work and must be carried out by a Licensed Building Practitioner.
• That using height safety equipment during above-floor work makes business sense both as a good employer and financially.
PDFs of both booklets can be downloaded from MBIE’s Building and Housing website at www.dbh.govt.nz/canterbury-earthquake-technical-guidance .

Uncontrolled run-off from building sites that may contain chemicals or toxins can enter and clog waterways, drains and the stormwater system, killing plants and wildlife. It may also be carried onto nearby properties, upsetting neighbours. There are many practical ways to stop it
Bare soil and loose materials on site can be swept up by heavy rain (or water from any other source) to become run-off. Where this runs down stormwater drains, it will flow straight into local streams or the sea. This can be seriously harmful, especially if the run-off carries concrete waste, paints or chemicals.
It’s not just bad news for nature  – under the Resource Management   Act, those responsible could be fined up to $600,000 or face two years in prison.
Ways to prevent run-off include:
Scheduling earthworks for dry weather.
Using tarpaulins or shotcrete to protect exposed soil.
Removing the minimum amount of vegetation possible.
Having just one stabilised accessway onto the site and putting down gap 65 aggregate to stop drivers tracking dirt onto the road.
Diverting water (other than rain) away from earthworks and onto stable ground (grass, gravel or permeable paving).
Keeping as much existing grass coverage on site as possible and stabilising bare soil as soon as possible with mulch, gravel,
planting or new grass.
Controlling the flow of water with channels or contour drains.
Sediment control
Control sediment run-off with:
Vegetation.
Silt fences on the downhill side of sloping sites to capture sediment run-off (figure 1).
Hay or straw bales to trap sediment.
Sediment ponds.
Keep silt control devices clear and ensure that cleared material cannot run into waterways or drains.
Concrete, asphalt and bitumen waste
Concrete wash water, cement slurry, asphalt and bitumen can join run-off when the materials are laid, equipment is washed or concrete is waterblasted to expose aggregate. Concrete and cement products can change the pH levels of streams, killing wildlife. One bucket of concrete wastewater in a stormwater drain can kill hundreds of fish and eels. It takes 100,000 litres of freshwater to dilute just 1 litre of concrete slurry to safe levels.
Contain run-off from concrete, asphalt and bitumen on site by:
Dewatering pile holes and footing trenches before pouring concrete to stop slurry spilling out and into drains.
Diverting it onto on-site grass or soil for later clean-up.
Containing it in an appropriate storage tank if possible.
Talk to subbies and delivery drivers to make sure they wash concrete equipment on unsealed ground on site, such as gravel or grass, and they don’t let washing water or concrete slurry run into stormwater drains.

For builders, particularly those overseeing an entire build, it’s important to ensure sub-contractors (such as painters) don’t accidentally reduce or fill a gap that’s been intentionally left open.
While most gaps in a building need to be sealed to prevent draughts and induction of moisture, spaces are sometimes required to provide separation between materials or elements and to allow drainage and drying, such as behind wall claddings. Understanding the difference is essential to the integrity of the building.
Specifically designed gaps or openings are incorporated into the building design, so that drainage and ventilation can occur.
“The most important gap requiring sealing is the one between the window or door reveal and the wall framing
Drainage is needed to deal with any water that may have entered the internal wall space through a cladding joint, a change in cladding material or around a window or door opening, so that it can drain out again.
Ventilation is needed to dry any moisture from behind a cladding after the water has drained out, or allow air pressure moderation between the drainage cavity and/or framing cavity and the outside. Pressure moderation restricts air and moisture flow from areas of higher pressure (outside) to areas of lower pressure (inside). This may take place across wall claddings and around window and door openings.
Examples of specifically designed gaps in E2/AS1 that must remain open include:
The drainage slots at the bottom of brick veneer walls at 800 mm centres maximum, ie every third perpend should be left open to allow for drainage (see figure 1).
Openings at the top of brick veneer walls for ventilation behind the veneer.
Between the bottom of the cladding and the top of a window head flashing – 5 mm minimum.
Between the bottom of the cladding and an inter-storey flashing – 5 mm minimum.
The sill window flange and the sill flashing for windows installed with direct-fixed cladding – 5 mm minimum.
A notched apron flashing downturn and the roofing profile – 5 mm maximum.
Another gap that must stay open is an air gap between a flexible roof underlay and roof insulation, so moisture cannot transfer across the materials – 25 mm minimum.
“Specifically designed gaps or openings are incorporated into the building design so that drainage and ventilation can occur
While not a gap as such, ventilation openings must be provided and left clear under a suspended timber floor. NZS 3604:2011 Timber-framed buildings requires 3,500 mm² of clear opening for each 1.0 m² of floor area.
In some situations, gaps between elements must not be left open.
The most important gap requiring sealing is the one between the window or door reveal and the wall framing forming the rough opening. A continuous airseal consisting of expanding foam over a PEF backing rod must be installed to prevent air movement from the outside to the building interior (see Figure 2).
Other gaps that must be sealed include
Movement control joints in claddings.
Movement control joints in tile finishes.
The space between the back of the jamb flange and window cladding of windows that are installed with direct-fixed sheet claddings.
These joints must be sealed with a flexible sealant installed according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

There can be several reasons why a solid timber strip floor may take on a cupped appearance where the board edges are higher than the centre of the board. This case study looks at the process of investigating why a floor cupped and how to fix it
Cupping of timber boards is often the result of a moisture imbalance through the timber boards. At other times, it is expansion pressure in the floor. By working through the process covered in this case study, you can identify the cause and remedy.
The flooring product The flooring was solid 80×19mm mixed timber that had been fixed in secret with staples and adhesive to a particleboard subfloor on LVL timber joists. The floor had been coated with a water-based polyurethane.
What is being investigated and why?
When viewed in reflected light, the cupped shape to the boards in the flooring was quite evident (see main image above). There are three possible reasons a floor will have a cupped shape:
Dry conditions above the floor.
Moist conditions beneath a floor.
Expansion pressure causing boards to peak at their edges.
Unless affected by specific heat sources, the industry would generally expect a floor to have a flat appearance, as did the owner in this case.
What needs to be considered?
The first aspect to consider is whether the boards are tight at adjoining edges or not.
If gapping is present, it often means that the moisture content has reduced from the time of installation with dry or very dry conditions prevailing above the floor.
If, however, board joints are tight, the floor is generally under some expansion pressure and either moisture beneath the floor or pressure effects in the floor are causing the cupped appearance. Check to see if cork expansion joints, if installed, have compressed. Measurement over 10 boards allows you to consider floor expansion.
Another aspect to be assessed is the moisture content of the flooring. For this, both resistance and capacitance moisture meters can be used. A resistance meter will mark the board surface and may not be appropriate to use. A capacitance moisture meter does not mark the board surface but will often only provide an indicative measure of board moisture content.
With a floor like this, it is useful to consider the humidity of the environments the floor is exposed to, including beneath the floor in the subfloor space and other subfloor aspects. Figure 2 below shows the subfloor space in the case study.
(Figure 2)
Investigation
During the inspection, it was observed that the board edges were tight and the cork expansion joint had closed a little. This was consistent with the floor being under some expansion pressure, but how much pressure ?
The measurements over 10 boards only recorded an average board width of 80.2mm, so there was not a lot of expansion or expansion pressure.
Assessing the moisture content with a capacitance moisture meter gave variable results, which were considered to be due to a range of species in the floor and, in this instance, was not that helpful. It was also not appropriate to use the resistance meter.
So where to from here ? The next step to continue the investigation was by assessing the relative humidity within the dwelling, outside the dwelling in a sheltered area and beneath the floor.
The dwelling’s family room spilled out onto a covered deck, and with patio doors open, we would expect similar relative humidity readings inside and out. We found 67% in the dwelling, 66% outside and 80% in the subfloor space. A 14% difference between external and subfloor humidities is a significant difference. You would expect the subfloor space to be a little cooler and a little more humid, but this degree of difference is greater than expected. Converting these relative humidities back to equivalent timber moisture contents, they would equate to 12% inside and 16% in the subfloor space.
What other observations are there from the subfloor space ? It was apparent that the ground sloped and that the subfloor area could be prone to seepage. There was also only significant ventilation from one end and a lack of adequate cross-flow ventilation. In areas of no cross-flow, the soil was damp and resistance moisture meter readings in solid pine framing members were high at 17% to 19% (see Figures 3 and 4 below).
(Figure 3)
(Figure 4)
Analysis and outcome
With a bit of investigation, the factors contributing to the cause of the cupping began to fall into place.
Due to both seepage and insufficient cross-flow ventilation, subfloor relative humidity was being maintained at high levels for extended periods, causing the moisture content of the particleboard and lower floorboard to rise. This imbalance in the moisture content of the strip timber flooring above had caused the cupping.
Higher moisture in the lower section of the board causes it to expand more than the upper exposed surface – the consequence of this being the cupped shaped of the boards. In this case, it was not overly severe.
A plastic moisture vapour barrier over the soil can be very beneficial. In some cases, dealing with seepage can require subfloor enclosed drainage and perhaps a pumping system.
A lack of cross-flow ventilation can be addressed by the addition (and/or clearing) of vents. At times, mechanical systems have needed to be installed.
What we can learn from this?
There are two lessons we can take away from this case study.
Firstly, if you are laying floors over an enclosed subfloor space, undertake a site assessment. In this instance and with little effort, the lack of sufficient ventilation and presence of seepage should have been identified. These would then be raised with the builder and/or owner to correct. The flooring would not be installed until remediation of the subfloor space and moisture contents of the subfloor over which you would be laying are back to normal.
Secondly, if inspecting a cupped floor over an enclosed subfloor space, don’t confine your investigation to only what is happening above the floor. The most valuable information is often gained from what is happening below the floor and considering relative humidity differences.

Investigating accidents, minor incidents and near misses is important in understanding the cause and looking at how it can be avoided in the future.
As of 1 July this year, the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) Health & Safety formed three specialist teams – Response, Investigation and Assessment – to deal with workplace accidents. In some circumstances, inspectors may request that you undertake a ‘duty holder review’ and give an analysis of the accident – what happened and why – and what your workplace will do to prevent a re occurrence.
It’s a misconception that most accidents on site are either unavoidable or the result of an employee’s error. Investigating reported accidents, incidents and near misses – events that did or might have caused harm – is important, as it allows management and staff to identify and understand the cause and assess if it was avoidable.
Accidents and incidents can have two types of causes – immediate causes and root causes. What’s important, and what MBIE inspectors are looking for, is root causes – the fundamental issue that caused an ‘unsafe action’.
1. Gather information , such as physical evidence, witness statements or other documents that might help piece together what happened. To determine the root cause of any accident, ask a series of questions:
How many times did the unsafe action take place before the injury occurred?
Why wasn’t this hazard identified, reported and corrected before the injury occurred?
Why did the workers think taking short cuts was acceptable?
Why was it not picked up on in the inspection process
Keep asking ‘why?’ and you will get to the root of the cause. Take thorough notes and document all evidence.
2. Analyse information – once you’ve collected all the information, analyse it to determine the immediate cause and, more importantly, the root cause of the accident.
3. Find a solution – look for solutions that will eliminate the root cause. Ask those who work closely to the hazards for their input. Implement the change into your health and safety systems.
4. Follow up – monitor your safety initiative and its effectiveness. Are you seeing real change? For example, is the incident and accident register showing positive trends?
MBIE requires all workplace accidents, unsafe situations or occurrences of serious harm to be notified to one central response team.
Call MBIE on 0800 20 90 20, or email at healthsafety.notification@dol.govt.nz.
Head to the MBIE website for more information – www.business.govt.nz/healthandsafetygroup
Immediate cause – the unsafe action. Root cause – the reason or the cause of the unsafe action.
A builder decides not to wear hearing protection – not wearing the protection is the immediate cause but the root cause could be lack of safety education, lack of correct-sized equipment or the builder’s boss not wearing his either.
Site Safe offers a two-day Supervisor Gold Card course that looks at how to run an investigation and how to identify and eliminate the risks associated with project hazards and unsafe behaviour.

With the Health and Safety at Work Act coming into effect in April next year, it’s important you understand your responsibilities under the new laws. In this two-part series, we’ll examine who is responsible when two or more PCBUs duties overlap
B ecause a person conducting a business or undertaking (PCBU) has duties to all workers affected by their work, not just to those they employ, it’s possible for PCBUs to have overlapping duties. This is a fundamental part of the Act’s design.
Many modern work situations involve multiple duty holders with overlapping duties. For example, there may be a number of different businesses working together or alongside each other on a single work site, such as a construction site, and through contracting or supply chains.
The previous Act created and provided for such overlapping duties, so the need for duty holders to work together to meet their duties is not new – it’s just more explicit in the new Act, and many workplaces will already be taking this approach.
The Act also makes it clear that PCBUs need to collaborate to meet their duties and ensure that the work does not place people’s health and safety at risk.
How should PCBUs work together?
Overlapping duties do not automatically require PCBUs to duplicate efforts. Instead, PCBUs will need to consult, cooperate, and coordinate activities to meet their shared responsibilities.
PCBUs cannot ‘contract out’ of their duty. However, they can and should make reasonable arrangements and coordinate responsibilities with the other PCBUs to fulfill their duty – so far as is reasonably practicable. The PCBUs should also monitor each other to ensure everyone is doing what was agreed.
The extent of a PCBU’s duty depends on the level of influence and control the PCBU has over health and safety matters at work, and the different circumstances that might be at play when there are multiple PCBUs.
This means that in practice, the measures a PCBU should take in relation to its own employees and contractors are likely to be different from the measures it should take in relation to the employees and contractors of another PCBU, as it will have less influence and control over the workers of another PCBU.
A PCBU that has less direct control and influence is more likely to fulfill its duty by making an arrangement with the PCBU that is closer to the work and has more direct influence and control.
Example 1: Overlapping duties in labour hire
A labour-hire PCBU contracts out a worker to a host PCBU. Both the labour hire PCBU and the host PCBU owe a duty of care to that worker – both are fully responsible for meeting that duty to the extent to which they have capacity to influence and control the matter. The labour hire PCBU cannot ‘contract out’ its duties to that host employer when it places a worker with them.
Both PCBUs need to consult and co-ordinate activities to ensure the health and safety of the labour hire worker.
Example 2: Overlapping duties on a large construction site
A large construction site has many PCBUs present: the head contractor, the subcontractors, and the client.
While all of these PCBUs have overlapping duties, the measures that they can take to discharge those duties will differ.
The client will typically owe duties to the workers that they influence or direct through any requirements they include in their contract with the principal contractor that will affect the health and safety of those workers. If a client requires that work be performed in a certain way or in a certain time, that may affect the health and safety of workers.
The head contractor will have a duty to the workers that work for them.
The head contractor will also have a duty to the workers on the site that it influences or directs. This is because the head contractor usually determines the sequencing of work and sets work methods, equipment and other site requirements that may affect all the workers on site – even those who aren’t employed by the head contractor directly.
The subcontractors will also have a duty to the workers that work for them.
The head contractor and the subcontractor should consult each other about the job requirements, the skills required of the workers, any health and safety risks associated with the work, and what each will do to control the risks.
Subcontractors will have a duty to each other’s workers, even where they do not have a direct contractual relationship with them. For example, the activities of a scaffolding PCBU can affect the safety of other workers on site.
The PCBUs can make arrangements with the other PCBUs on the site where they have overlapping duties. In this case, the head contractor and subcontractor have to ensure access to first aid facilities.
It’s likely the head contractor will provide those facilities for all workers on site, but the subcontractor must confirm they’re in place and accessible to their own workers as well. The head contractor would also usually provide security for the site as a whole.

Workers in the construction industry can be exposed to many hazardous substances on site, so it’s important you know how and where to access the best information in case something goes wrong
What do you do when a workmate splashes something into their eyes or a chemical is accidentally spilled? When using hazardous materials, there is a good chance you will find instructions or warnings on a product label or wrapper.
However, that might not give you enough information, which is why every building site should have safety data sheets on hand.
Safety Data Sheets (SDSs) give specific details on the hazards of different materials and how they can be safely handled – from when they are initially transported and stored on site, through to when they are used or disposed of.
They give first aid information and indicate what risks to the environment a material poses. They also outline what to do if there is a fire or other emergency.
There are SDSs for a very wide range of hazardous or potentially hazardous materials, from paints and solvents to treated timbers.
Under the law, the person in charge of the workplace must ensure that SDSs are available to workers where materials are on site above specified minimum quantities. However, it’s easier and more practical to have safety data sheets available for all hazardous materials regardless of quantity. Information on safety data sheets includes:
Product and company identification.
Hazard identification.
Composition and information on ingredients.
First-aid measures.
Fire-fighting measures.
Spillage / accidental release measures.
Handling and storage.
Exposure controls and personal protection.
Physical and chemical properties.
Stability and reactivity.
Toxicological information.
Ecological information.
Disposal considerations.
Transport information.
Regulatory information.
Other information.
The seller or supplier of a hazardous substance must supply an SDS if:
Requested to do so.
The substance being sold or supplied to a workplace is above the relevant threshold quantity.
They had not previously supplied an SDS for that substance.
If you don’t have a sheet, request one from your supplier. Many are also available online. The seller or supplier is also responsible for ensuring the SDS is compliant.
The person in charge of the workplace must ensure that SDSs are present and available to workers, where threshold quantities are exceeded. The information on the safety data sheet must be available to a person handling the substance within 10 minutes of the information being required.
Although it is not a legislative requirement, it is best practice for an SDS to be revised every five years. An SDS must be updated if there is new information available on the substance, including its hazardous properties and any relevant health and safety information.
Foreign sheets
Safety data sheets prepared by manufacturers overseas can be used in New Zealand if they carry the right information, including local supplier details and emergency contact information.
The legal requirements are set out in the Hazardous Substances and New Organisms Act 1996 and regulations such as the Hazardous Substances (Identification) Regulations 2001. The Hazardous Substances (Emergency Management) Regulations 2001 and Hazardous Substances (Disposal) Regulations 2001 also apply. There is a code of practice that covers the preparation of safety data sheets.

Hazardous airborne substances such as dust and chemicals can be a significant risk on site, with the potential to cause cancer, organ damage and, in worst-case scenarios, death. Masks or respiratory protective equipment (RPE) are one way of preventing harm
Often these harmful substances cannot be seen with the naked eye. Site Safe has put together some tips on what you need to think about when investing in RPE.
RPE, like other types of personal protective equipment, should be considered a last resort. Before using it, you should try to eliminate or minimise the risk of exposure and do a risk assessment justifying its use.
You’ll also need to remember to monitor the health of anyone using RPE who could be at risk, to ensure it’s working effectively. Before using RPE, consider:
Using a safer substance.
Enclosing the task to prevent it escaping into the air.
Modifying the process eg, suppress dust with water.
Extracting emissions/dust eg, use local exhaust ventilation (LEV).
Providing workers with RPE is not a quick and easy fi x – it can be costly to maintain and replace. Over time, engineering control measures such as local exhaust ventilation may be more cost-effective.
However, there will be times when you do need to use RPE, such as:
While you are arranging other control measures.
For clearing up a spill.
During temporary failure of a control measure eg, sudden failure of LEV.
For cleaning, eg, low pressure washing of a dusty shed.
For short, one-off procedures.
Respirator options
There are three main types of respirators, each are appropriate for different tasks.
a) Filter respirators
These are designed to filter out contaminants and come in two main types –particulate respirators that filter out dust, and gas respirators that filter out gas and vapours.
b) Powered-air purifying respirators
Also known as PAPRs, these work by using powerful fans to force contaminated air through filters to provide purified air.
c) Supplied air respirators
These provide a steady supply of clean air from an external source, such as a cylinder or air compressor.
Selecting the right RPE can be confusing; we recommend you get advice from occupational hygienists and RPE suppliers.
Substance, operator and task
If you are selecting RPE, you should consider the following: substance, operator and task.
a) Substance – What is the type, nature and toxicity of the contaminant?
Is it a mist, gas or solid?
If it doesn’t work correctly or fails, what is the worst that could happen?
If there were an accident, would it be a fire hazard?
What control measures does the Safety Data Sheet (SDS) for the substance you are working with recommend?
Are you choosing the right type of RPE and fi lter for the hazard?
b) Operator – Who is the RPE for?
Get the right size and face fit for the individual performing the task, remembering that facial hair will have an effect.
It needs to be reasonably comfortable and compatible with other PPE that is being worn.
Arrange for fi t testing. This can often be done by the supplier and is a good chance to teach your workers the correct way to wear and use their new equipment.
c) Task – What are you using the RPE for?
Is it for regular use, short or long duration?
Is it being used in a confined or ventilated space, light or heavy work?
What is the access and location of air and does the wearer need clear vision?
You’ll need to have a maintenance programme that includes cleaning and checking for defects.
Remember to store RPE properly – it’s best to use an airtight container.
What kind of RPE do I need?
The selection of RPE will usually require expert help. As an example, though, general construction work, asbestos work, spraying, brushing/rolling and welding/fabrication all require different types of respirator.
General construction work might include cutting, sawing, sanding, drilling, sweeping etc. This type of work could create silica dust, wood dust and general nuisance dust.
A disposable respirator is usually suitable for most general construction tasks where exposures are low (less than ten times the workplace exposure standard), and where it will only be used for short periods. Get an expert to help you determine your workplace exposure standards.
For general construction work where exposure is more than 50 times the workplace exposure standard, a full-face reusable respirator and filter will be required.
Disposable respirators are not suitable for asbestos, spraying, brushing/rolling or welding or fabrication work.
Need more help? Contact one of our expert health and safety advisors at www.sitesafe.org.nz to discuss your RPE needs. They’ll be more than happy to give you the advice you need to stay safe on site.

Asbestos removal has been in the headlines recently, with concerns that asbestos awareness in the construction industry is still not as high as it needs to be to prevent deaths. As New Zealand’s leading killer in the workplace, Site Safe asks if you’re sure you’re prepared to address it safely?
I f asbestos-containing materials (ACMs) are disturbed, tiny fibres are released. These fibres are hazardous if breathed in and could lodge in the lungs, with potential to cause diseases such as asbestosis, lung cancer, and mesothelioma.
If you don’t take the right precautions to protect yourself, you could risk your life, livelihood and family.
Friable ACMs are especially dangerous, as the fibres are easily released into the air. Non-friable asbestos is also risky, as it can become friable if damaged or old.
How do I know where asbestos is onsite?
Asbestos is encountered by many tradespeople but is especially dangerous in demolition environments. Sanding, drilling and cutting ACMs also release the fibres.
ACMs are commonly found in:
Insulation.
Soundproofing.
Sprayed-on fireproofing.
Decorative coatings.
Floor coverings (eg; vinyl).
Cladding.
Roofing.
An asbestos management plan sets out where any identified asbestos or asbestos-containing material is present, and how it will be managed. A copy of the asbestos management plan should be readily accessible to workers and their representatives, as well as to other person conducting a business or undertaking (PCBUs).
What should I do if I suspect asbestos is present?
If you have any suspicion that asbestos is present before you even start work, get an asbestos survey completed by an asbestos surveyor.
An asbestos surveyor should have:
Sufficient training, qualifications, knowledge, experience.
An ability to sample and identify asbestos through an IANZ-accredited laboratory.
Sufficient knowledge of the tasks required and the risks the work will involve.
Independence and use of a quality management system.
If you do uncover or damage materials that you think might contain asbestos:
Stop work immediately.
Keep people away.
Minimise the spread of contamination to other areas.
Get advice on what to do next from a licensed professional.
If you have identified asbestos and it needs to be removed because it’s in poor condition, or as part of renovations, then it’s time to call in a licensed asbestos remover. WorkSafe NZ is responsible for licensing asbestos removal professionals. The only exceptions are if the removal:
Is 10m2 or less of non-friable asbestos or asbestos-contaminated dust (ACD) associated with the removal of the non-friable asbestos over the whole course of the removal project, or
ACD that is not associated with the removal of friable or non-friable asbestos and is only a minor contamination.
How can I protect myself?
Three simple steps will help keep you safe if you encounter materials you suspect might be ACMs:
Keep dust down.
Use the right PPE.
Clean up properly.
Other risk controls include:
Containing and isolating sites where ACMs are present.
Ensuring that trained professionals carry out the removal of ACMs and ACDs.
Using plastic drop sheets in ACM work areas.
Using full and oversized disposable PPE and the minimum of a disposable P2 mask.
Using only micro filter vacuums.
Using low-pressure wet work methods (sprayers) and not pressured water hoses (including garden hoses).
Training of all workers likely to encounter asbestos.
Properly cleaning areas and wiping down surfaces.
Disposing of ACMs as per guidance.
Disposing of PPE in a double bag and clearly labelled as containing ACD.
How can I protect others?
Communication with everybody who may be affected by the work is critical to keep everyone safe. This includes:
Workers and any other people in the workplace.
The person who commissioned the asbestos removal work.
Any person at or near the workplace (eg, neighbours along boundary fences).
Anyone occupying premises near the workplace.
Communications must clearly state:
Why the work is being undertaken.
What is involved with the work.
When it will start and finish.
The safeguards that will be in place during the works.
****************************************************************************
Myth busting!
Myth: It’s easy to spot asbestos.
Fact: Asbestos isn’t always easy to identify. The only accurate way to confirm its presence is through asbestos testing conducted by an IANZ-accredited laboratory.
Myth: I can remove non-friable asbestos myself.
Fact: Non-friable asbestos is still risky as it can become friable if damaged or old.
Myth: This building was built after 1 January 2000, she’ll be right.
Fact: It is still possible for buildings built after the year 2000 to contain asbestos. Products containing asbestos were able to be imported until October 2016. Asbestos can be in places that you might not expect, so you could encounter it without knowing.
Myth: Effects from asbestos exposure will be immediately felt.
Fact: Asbestos-related diseases take years to develop (and not all people exposed develop such diseases).

If you’re a PCBU involved in woodworking activities, this article outlines the health risks from wood dust and some reasonably practical ways you can protect your workers
W ood processing causes small particles of dust to become suspended in the air, which can be inhaled by workers.
A person’s upper respiratory system can filter out the larger particles but smaller particles can go deep into the lungs, causing damage and scarring to lung tissue. Each time this happens, a small amount of irreversible damage occurs.
This damage reduces the lungs’ ability to take in oxygen and, over time, makes it increasingly difficult to breathe. The presence of glues, resins, formaldehyde and other wood treatment chemicals in some wood products increases the health risks from wood dust.
Why is it necessary to control wood dust?
Wood dust poses the following health risks:
Inhaling dust into the lungs can cause breathing problems and lead to lung diseases, such as occupational asthma and lung cancer. Breathing in dust is the most common type of exposure.
Swallowing wood dust can affect the intestines, bloodstream and vital organs and make people ill.
Getting dust in the eyes can cause irritation and damage.
Skin contact with wood dust can cause ulceration of the skin, irritation and dermatitis.
What causes high dust exposures?
The following activities are likely to cause high dust exposures:
Sawing and cutting.
Routing and turning.
Sanding.
Dry sweeping of dust.
Bagging dust from dust extraction systems.
What are my responsibilities?
If you’re a PCBU, you have a duty to ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, the health and safety of your workers and other workers whose activities you influence or direct. PCBUs must eliminate risks so far as is reasonably practicable and, where this is not possible, they must minimise them.
PCBUs have a duty to monitor the health of their workers and their workplace conditions to ensure that they aren’t injured or made ill by their work.
How to control wood dust exposure
When selecting controls, WorkSafe expects, so far as is reasonable practicable, preference be given to controls that protect multiple workers at a time. For example, local exhaust ventilation (LEV) will protect everyone in the workplace, whereas respiratory protective equipment (RPE) only protects the person wearing it.
You should apply the most effective and practical control measures. In most cases, personal protective equipment (PPE), such as RPE, shouldn’t be the first or only control considered. Listed below are some controls that can be used to manage wood dust:
Eliminate the risk by buying pre-cut or processed wood materials.
Local exhaust ventilation (LEV) is one of the most effective ways to control dust at the source. Use LEV systems to capture dust from cutting, shaping and sanding wood.
Use on-tool extraction saws and grinders to control wood dust at the source.
Refer to the manufacturer’s operating instructions for equipment use and maintenance. For example, use the correct saw blade or planer.
Use water-damping methods where practical.
Don’t use blowers, fans or compressed air to move wood dust.
Provide a suitable industrial vacuum to remove dust from work areas.
Minimise worker exposure by limiting the time each person spends doing dusty work.
Advise workers to wear RPE when emptying vacuum cleaner bags or collection bags.
Ensure workers wear RPE and other PPE suitable for the task. Advise workers to carefully remove work clothing at the end of the task or shift to avoid generating dust clouds.
Provide washing facilities at work, so that dust is not taken home.
Advise workers to wash their face and hands immediately after finishing the task and before eating, drinking or smoking.
When should exposure monitoring be carried out?
If you’re not certain if dust levels could be harmful, exposure monitoring should be undertaken by occupational hygienists or other suitably trained personnel.
This monitoring will help determine the most appropriate wood dust control methods and respiratory protection for workers. Exposure monitoring should be undertaken regularly to check the effectiveness of controls. If the controls are not working, seek advice from an occupational health specialist or LEV engineer.
When should health monitoring be carried out?
Health monitoring is a way to check if workers are getting sick from exposure to hazards while carrying out their work; the aim is to detect early signs of ill-health or disease. It can also show if control measures are working effectively.
Where workers are routinely exposed to wood dust, you should arrange health monitoring for them. Monitoring should include a baseline and annual lung function tests, as well as a respiratory questionnaire.
Follow the recommendations of an occupational health practitioner with experience in health monitoring when determining what type of monitoring is required.
Respiratory protective equipment
It’s important to ensure that you provide your workers with a respirator that will protect against airborne wood dust (different respirators protect against different types of contaminants).
Some respirators need a tight seal between the mask and the worker’s face to provide protection.
If you provide this type of RPE, you need to arrange for your workers to have an annual fitting to ensure it fits properly. Workers also need to be clean-shaven to ensure a tight seal.
You can get information on RPE selection, fit testing and training from occupational health specialists and suppliers of RPE.
Worker training
Educate your workers about risks from wood dust and the control measures. Regular training is important to ensure worker awareness remains high.
If you’d like to discuss this at your toolbox talks, you can download factsheets from the Worksafe website.

With the sun hanging around across much of the country, it’s important that you be aware of the unique risks posed by high temperatures and how to deal with them
Under the Health and Safety at Work Act 2015, employers have a duty of care to protect their workers, so taking sun safety seriously is vital. Along with having one the world’s highest incidences of skin cancer, other sun-related issues include severe sunburn, dehydration, heat stroke and the increased likelihood of fatigue.
There are a number of different ways employers and their staff can minimise these risks, starting with following basic rules such as ‘slip, slop, slap’.
When it comes to sunblock, the Cancer Society recommends using a SPF30 strength product (at a minimum), applying it at least 20 minutes before going outside, and reapplying at least every two hours.
Wearing long pants and a long-sleeved, collared shirt reduces the amount of skin workers expose to the sun. Hardhats with brims or flaps and UV-resistant safety glasses should also be worn.
Additionally, the Cancer Society also recommends that employers:
Develop and enforce a SunSmart policy.
Reduce the amount of time workers spend outdoors.
Provide information and training around sun protection practices.
Encourage staff to check their own skin and go to the GP if they have any concerns.
Invisible threat
According to Environmental Health Indicators New Zealand (EHINZ) – a government-funded research, training and consultancy group, specialising in environmental health information – approximately 90% of skin cancer is caused by exposure to UV rays. These rays fall outside the visible spectrum of light and can’t be detected by sight or feel.
Risk from UV exposure is highest during the summer, autumn and spring months and between 11am and 3pm on a day-to-day basis. People working further north also have increased levels of risk due to being closer to the equator.
To find out the risk in your area, check out the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research’s UV Index . Remember, protection is required whenever the index reads above three – see Table 1 for more information.

Don’t forget fatigue!
Fatigue is more than a drowsy feeling, it is a state of mental or physical exhaustion – or in some cases both. A number of factors can contribute to fatigue, with high temperatures among one of the most common. Below we revisit some tips for dealing with fatigue from Site Safe New Zealand previously published in Under Construction .
To reduce fatigue during periods of high heat, SiteSafe recommends employers avoid scheduling work during periods of extreme temperature, potentially by starting and finishing earlier, and providing adequate shelter and facilities for rest, sleep and meal breaks.
Workers also need to take responsibility for their own safety, and they can reduce their chances of fatigue by:
Turning up fit for work, having done everything possible to get a good sleep and rest.
Letting their manager or supervisor know if a task is beyond their skills.
Recognising the signs and symptoms of fatigue.
Telling a senior person on site if they start showing signs and symptoms of fatigue.
Making managers and supervisors aware of other workers who may be fatigued.
Reporting fatigue-related incidents.

The Preventing Falls from Height project is not just about taking enforcement action against unsafe work practices. Health and safety inspectors spent many hours engaging with the industry to ensure construction workers and business owners understand the Best Practice Guidelines for Working at Height.
Last year, inspectors conducted 1,700 visits and seminars at workplaces and in partnership with trade suppliers.
These events are the perfect opportunity for participants to ask their local health and safety inspectors about safety guidance and practices – a selection of the most frequently asked questions (FAQs) is printed below and three more will be featured next month. The full list is available at dol.govt.nz/prevent-falls/information.asp
No. At no time is any person to stand on or work from an external wall top plate without suitable fall protection. This must be considered as part of your planning for a safe approach to working at height.
If prefabrication of the roof structure is not possible and trusses are assembled in situ, a safe working platform (such as scaffold) should be provided around the perimeter of the framing.
Measures to prevent or mitigate the distance of a fall must also be provided internally. This can be achieved by providing a working platform immediately beneath the underside of the trusses. Either conventional scaffolding, or (if appropriate) proprietary decking systems can be used. The use of safety mesh or other safety-rated products that can span across the top of the framing can also be used.
Alternatively, if a safe internal working platform cannot be provided, safety nets can be used if a safe clearance distance below the net and a suitable fixing point can be achieved. Other soft landing systems, such as bean bags or air bags, may also be used. In some circumstances, safe clearance distance can be achieved by locating the bracing of the framing on the outside of the structure.
More information can be found in factsheet The safe installation of roof trusses.
Yes. Single-storey dwellings require the same level of protection as two-storey dwellings and the same process must be followed to establish appropriate control measures. For example, where edge protection is the appropriate control measure required, it should be installed on a single-level dwelling in the same way as on multi-level dwellings.
Refer to factsheet Be safe working on roofs.
Generally saw horses or saw horses with planks are not recognised as suitable work platforms, as they have not been designed for this purpose. The exception to this rule would be if the equipment was purposely designed and manufactured for this use and meets a relevant NZ Standard.
There is a variety of access equipment on the market to make working at height safer. Your duty is to take all practicable steps to prevent any harm that would result from a fall.
Working from a work platform with a guardrail will offer far better far protection than one without. Focusing your attention on work above your head increases the risk of stepping off the board or platform and falling if you do not employ a guardrail.
Any work platform should be fit for purpose. There are two types of work platform:
A proprietary (engineered) work platform constructed and used in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions.
A constructed work platform using construction materials and built by a competent person. (This is only to be considered if no alternative forms of work platform are readily available.)
Have a look around your local access equipment hirer or trade supplier for ideas on more appropriate equipment. Podium steps could be one option.
Your hazard assessment must consider the site-specific factors and arrive at a decision that is justified by your assessment.
For more information, refer to section 6.6 of the Best Practice Guidelines for Working at Height and the factsheet Temporary work platforms.
Doing nothing is not an option!
Is my three-step ladder still legal to use?
What is the maximum height to which I can use my ladder?
From what height do I have to use fall protection?
Can ceiling battens be used as a method of fall protection?
What training is required to erect my own scaffolding and to what height can I go?
Do I need a rescue plan when working at height?
How often does scaffolding need to be inspected?
Can I use a safety harness when working alone?
The full list is available at dol.govt.nz/prevent-falls/information.asp or phone the Ministry on 0800 20 90 20.

Site Safe separates fact from fiction by looking at some commonly asked questions regarding working at heights
We are often asked if the use of a harness is necessary while working on a scissor lift.
According to Worksafe’s Best practice guidelines for working at height in New Zealand, a harness should be worn when working on a scissor lift – unless a risk assessment has proven that the work can be done safely without a harness and there is no risk of falling. Remember:
When using a scissor lift or other elevating work platform, such as a cherry picker, and using a harness, you should ideally be protected by a double-lanyard system fitted with a short energy absorber or fit for purpose self-retracting lifeline (SRL), fixed to a certified anchor point.
The worker operating the lift must be competent in its use.
Make sure to follow any instructions given by the manufacturer.
People must work inside guardrails and not reach or climb over the rails. Workers need to keep both feet on the work platform.
If you often work at height, it’s a good idea to regularly practise and review your rescue plan – that way, if the worst does happen, everyone will know what to do.
Are you competent?
If you or your workers are wearing a harness, you all need to be trained. Only trained and competent people can install and use harness systems on site. A qualified person must train untrained workers before they can use a harness system.
They will also need to be supervised at all times by another worker who is also trained and competent. For workers completing basic work, a recommended way of showing competence is NZQA Unit Standard 23229 – Use a safety harness for personal fall prevention when working at height .
If you are involved in planning, installing and/or operating fall arrest systems and supervising staff, NZQA Unit Standard 15757 – Use, install and disestablish proprietary fall arrest systems when working at height is recommended.
To get these Unit Standards, check out Site Safe’s Height and Harness Safety and Fall Arrest Systems courses. To learn more about how to do a risk assessment, download Site Safe’s free Risk Guide from their website or check out their new Risk Management course.
Working at height checklist
Before getting started, you should work through the following checklist:
Identify the task/s that need to be done.
Identify the hazards for each task.
Identify the risks associated with each hazard.
Identify control measures.
Pick the right mobile elevating platform for the job.
Develop your plan (this could be done via a Safe Work Method Statement or a Task Analysis).
Make a plan for what to do in an emergency.
Record the planning, including any rescue plan.
Involve staff and talk to everyone working on the job about the plan.
Review the plan before the job starts and make any necessary amendments.

More people take chances at lower heights, because they seem less of a risk⁠— but these kinds of falls come with their own dangers
It doesn’t take much height to lead to a fatal fall. In fact, many falls from roofs and ladders that cause death or serious injury are from less than three metres.
One of the most recent deaths was a 45-year-old construction worker in Hobsonville, who in May fell from the first floor of a building onto concrete.
Ryan Groves, a safety advisor at construction safety organisation Site Safe, says low level heights have their own dangers.
One is just that people are more complacent, or maybe optimistic, about safety at lower levels.
“Put somebody 20 metres above ground on scaffolding and they’ll usually take all the precautions required,” says Ryan.
“Put somebody two or three metres up a ladder and they’re more likely to take risks. But the concrete doesn’t get any softer.
“It’s the same with people working on a truck deck or a ute deck or on the single storey of a residential dwelling.”
Ryan says this also applies to people standing on roofs cleaning their guttering or climbing a ladder to do some maintenance. People seem to naturally have an instinct that low-level falls aren’t going to hurt.
Another, less obvious reason low-level falls can be so devastating is that most people don’t have the reflexes to allow them to protect themselves.
“When you fall from a low-level you just don’t have enough time to put your hands out and do anything to fix it,” says Ryan.
“At six metres you can do a full revolution. So you might fall backwards and be able to land back on your feet so you just break an ankle or a leg. But if you fall at three metres or less most people don’t have enough time to correct their stance and can fall onto their spine or their neck.”
He says there was a case of a tradesman who fell 2.2 metres when his feet slipped out from under him. He ended up landing on his head and breaking his neck.
“He would have recognised he was falling but your brain takes longer than that to respond and react.”
Beware trucks and utes
Injury falls from trucks and the backs of utes are also common. WorkSafe figures for 2019 show there have already been two deaths from vehicle falls. One was a 71-year-old who fell from a truck trailer in Wellington, the other was a 65-year-old in Auckland who fell from a truck.
“A delivery truck can turn up to a residential building site with prenailed framing and people climb up to three metres to get to them,” says Ryan.
“I mean, you put a guard rail around people working at two metres on a house, but a truck driver can be working at three metres with nothing.”
He says planning a job is a huge part  of dealing with any risks to workers.
“The Health and Safety in Work Act talks about having a work method statement. Something that’s not necessarily a task analysis or a job safety analysis (JSA), but at least a written system that says ’this is how we’re going to do a job’,” says Ryan.
“Before we start a job we assess it, identify any risks and control them. We do a 5 x 5 (see below) or a simple prestart check. These can pick up on those risks quite easily and alert people to anything that could catch them out.”
Avoid the void
There are also common building practices that can lead to a major hazard on a site.
“For example, when it comes to putting stairs in a two-storey house, these are usually installed late in the build because the builder doesn’t want them to get damaged. But that leaves a gaping hole in the middle of a floor where the stairs are going to go,” says Ryan.
“They assume because everybody knows it’s there, nobody will fall down, but it leaves a void, and a significant fall risk, there.”
Earlier this year, WorkSafe prosecuted an Auckland construction company after a worker fell through such a void. He received traumatic brain injury and fractures to his skull and right arm when he fell 3.4 metres on a residential building site. The company was found guilty and fined $100,000.
Ryan says the answer is to put the stairs in early, but cover them in plywood so they’re actually usable.
“It’s always key to think about planning a job to remove any risk of falls,” says Ryan.
“In fact, the best controls are ones  that don’t require a worker to make  any big decisions, such as putting  up protective barriers and edge  protection, or using properly erected scaffolding.”
Five by five
The 5 by 5 system for reducing risks of all kinds is to:
Identify hazards.
Assess the risk level of risk each hazard identified.
Control the risk to reduce the harm and its severity.
Reassess the level of risk for each hazard.
Review and monitor that controls are working and risk levels are acceptable.

Asbestos is New Zealand’s number one killer in the workplace and is responsible for approximately 170 fatalities a year. As part of the recent Health and Safety at Work Act, the regulations for working with asbestos changed – Site Safe has put together some quick tips on what you need to know
B reathing in airborne asbestos fibres is a serious health risk. Once the fibres enter a person’s system, they lodge in the lungs and may cause diseases like asbestosis, lung cancer and mesothelioma.
These hazardous fibres are released when asbestos-containing material (ACM) is disturbed and, if you don’t take the right precautions to protect yourself, you could be risking your life and your livelihood.
Tradespeople at high risk
WorkSafe New Zealand’s 2013 report Asbestos and other Occupational Lung Diseases in New Zealand showed that the National Asbestos Medical Panel was notified of 1,366 cases of Asbestos-related illnesses between March 1992 and July 2013.
The report also found that, by occupation, carpenters, electricians and plumbers combined to account for 67% of all cases. That’s because, until the mid-1980s, asbestos was often used as a fire retardant and for insulation. It can often be found in places such as:
Sprayed-on fireproofing.
Soundproofing.
Thermal insulation.
Decorative coatings.
Floor coverings, such as vinyl.
Cement products, roofing sheets.
Lagging around pipes.
If you have any suspicions that asbestos is present, ask an asbestos surveyor to conduct a survey. If asbestos is found, you should bring in a licensed professional.
If you do uncover or damage materials that may contain asbestos:
Stop the work immediately.
Keep people away.
Minimise the spread of contamination to other areas.
Get advice on what to do next from a professional.
New rules
In April last year, a licensing system for the removal of asbestos was introduced by WorkSafe. There are two types of licences, Class A and B, which determine the type and amount of asbestos that you can remove.
Class A holders can remove:
Friable asbestos or ACM (asbestos containing material).
Asbestos-contaminated dust or debris (ACD).
Non-friable asbestos or ACM.
Class B holders can remove:
Non-friable asbestos or ACM.
ACD associated with removing non-friable asbestos or ACM.
However, a competent person without a licence can remove:
10m² or less of non-friable asbestos or ACM and the associated ACD cumulatively over a project’s life.
Minor amounts of ACD, not associated with the removal of friable or non-friable asbestos.
Supervision
Licence holders can nominate supervisors on their WorkSafe licence to supervise workers. A licence must have at least one nominated supervisor. There is no limit on the number of supervisors, provided they meet the criteria.
Supervisors must be aged 18 or over, have a level of experience relevant to the class of licence, be present at the removal area when Class A work is carried out, and in the vicinity and readily available whenever Class B work is being carried out, and be suitably qualified as per WorkSafe requirements.
However, supervisors must have completed the correct training by the end of the April 4, 2018 transition period.
From April 4, 2018, assessors will be required to provide air quality monitoring and clearance certificates for Class A removals.
Notifications of licensed asbestos removal should now be made to WorkSafe five days before work starts.
Current certificate holders can continue to operate until the certificate expires, or until April 4, 2018 – whichever is earlier. If you’re removing friable asbestos or more than 10m² of non-friable, you must apply for a licence, which will be granted with conditions.
More info
Last November, WorkSafe introduced a new Approved Code of Practice for the Management and Removal of Asbestos.
To download the code, or to learn more about basic asbestos risks on Site Safe’s Passport Plus – Worker Health course or Site Safe’s Passport Plus – Flexi (Online + Classroom) course, go to www.sitesafe.org.nz .

Worker engagement and participation is a big focus in the Health and Safety at Work Act. In a nutshell, it’s about talking with your team and having meaningful discussions about your health and safety policies. Here are some tips to help you get on top of worker engagement and participation
The Health and Safety at Work Act asks those in charge of a workplace to carry out worker engagement and participation with their team. If you’re an employer, or what the Act calls a Person Conducting a Business or Undertaking (PCBU), you are expected to:
Share information.
Give workers the opportunity to share their views and contribute to decision making.
Advise workers of any outcomes and decisions you have made.
Participation is a way that workers can raise any concerns they have about health and safety and suggest improvements. It’s also an effective way to involve them in the decision-making process. When working well, participation means:
Workers know how to participate and report issues to the PCBU.
Workers have the opportunity to raise issues or suggestions.
The PCBU considers and responds to workers quickly.
Why is it important?
Worker engagement and participation helps you build a good health and safety culture. This ultimately leads to increased productivity, less down time, and means you don’t need to worry about finding a replacement if someone gets hurt.
If you get workers involved, they can often come up with the best solutions, as they are the ones carrying out the job every day. In addition, if they have helped with the process, they will be more involved and engaged at work. This often means they will work harder and turn out better work for the team.
What must workplaces do?
How a business engages in participation depends on the size of the organisation and the type of work it carries out.
However, the law is clear – a PCBU must regularly engage with workers in a deliberate and planned way. This means that it is good to have formal channels for your workers to make a contribution, in addition to the informal ways that many businesses offer. Some potential ways include:
Health and safety reps.
Health and safety committees.
Inform workers of the outcome of incidents that they have reported in a timely fashion. People are more likely to get involved in health and safety if they can see that you value it and are acting on their feedback.
Staff intranet or noticeboard.
Allow workers to raise issues in person with the manager.
Toolbox talks/pre-start meetings. Include a toolbox talk as part of your regular prestart meeting. These provide an opportunity to give positive feedback for safe actions, hard work and initiatives. The meeting shouldn’t be a lecture, but a chance for engagement with the team.
Create a suggestions box as a convenient way for workers to suggest health and safety improvements.
Staff surveys.
Workplace inspection.
Include health and safety as a regular agenda item during team meeting.
Reward good reporting by encouraging workers to report safe actions, incidents and observations by providing recognition such as a prize or work shout.
For more information about toolbox talks, check out Site Safe’s Practical Safety Advice pages for ideas. There’s also a toolbox talk minutes template that Site Safe members can download for free.
Want more? Check out Site Safe’s Leadership in Safety course, which is designed to help you engage with workers and contractors on site. Visit www.sitesafe.org for more information.

Friable asbestos must only be removed by a licensed asbestos removalist, says WorkSafe, following a ruling by Christchurch District Court, in which an unlicensed South Island handyman was fined $15,000 for removing friable asbestos.
Glenn Warwick Sibley operated a business specialising in the repair and maintenance of buildings.
In 2018, Sibley was hired to complete renovation work on a Queenstown property, which included the removal and replacement of ceiling tiles containing friable asbestos. Friable asbestos can be crumbled or crushed by hand.
Rob Birse, WorkSafe’s Principal Advisor Asbestos, said that after work began, WorkSafe received a notification that the ceiling was being removed unsafely.
“A non-disturbance notice was issued and later testing came back positive for the presence of asbestos,” said Birse.
As a result, an investigation was launched. The investigation found that Sibley was aware asbestos had been detected in the house, but was not a licensed asbestos removalist at the time work was undertaken.
“Friable asbestos is an extremely dangerous material, which poses health risks such as lung disease or even cancer when disturbed. WorkSafe does not take these matters lightly,” said Birse.
“If you need to remove friable asbestos, it must be done safely by a licensed asbestos removalist.
“Sibley did not conduct a risk assessment, or have an asbestos removal control plan around the removal of the friable asbestos.
“He also failed to ensure he or his workers had correct personal protective equipment when removing the ceiling tiles. It is fair to say he exposed his workers to asbestos fibres.
“This was a completely botched asbestos removal job, which put workers at risk.”
Friable and non-friable
Asbestos is divided into two categories as far as regulation of its removal is concerned: friable and non-friable.
Friable asbestos crumbles into dust and releases asbestos particles easily – often found in pipe-lagging or mixed with plaster. This is the most dangerous form of asbestos.
Non-friable asbestos is bound up with other material (often cement) and doesn’t so easily release asbestos into the air. It is commonly found in cladding panels and boards.
How to remove it right
To remove any amount of friable asbestos, a licence is required. To remove more than 10m 2 of non-friable asbestos also requires a licence. If the total amount of non-friable asbestos containing material is less than 10m 2 , you do not need a licence, but there are still requirements on PCBUs and workers to identify and handle it safely.
What licences are required?
Class A
This licence is required for removing any amount of friable asbestos.
Class B
This licence is required for removing more than 10m 2 of non-friable asbestos.
Supervisor licence
In addition to workers requiring a Class A or Class B licence, in most cases, removal work can only be carried out under the supervision of someone holding an asbestos supervisor licence.
What is required to get the licences?
One-day training courses are required for Class A and Class B licences respectively. The asbestos removal supervisor licence requires Class A and Class B licences and experience removing friable and non-friable asbestos.

WorkSafe’s Enforceable Undertaking initiative is providing businesses in breach of safety practices an opportunity to correct their safety measures as an alternative to traditional prosecution
The completion of an Enforceable Undertaking (EU) by Woods Glass is one example of the WorkSafe enforcement tool that serves as an alternative to prosecution.
In 2018, a Woods Glass worker suffered crushing injuries to their leg while operating a glass cutting machine. Woods Glass applied to WorkSafe successfully for an EU, a voluntary agreement between WorkSafe and a Person Conducting a Business or Undertaking (PCBU) following a breach of the Health and Safety at Work Act (HSWA) 2015.
Woods Glass is a medium-sized business specialising in glass supply and commercial glazing, with branches across the country. As part of its EU, the company was required to develop resources and implement a suite of  initiatives to benefit its workplace and workers.
This included modifying its migrant worker induction programme so it is easier to understand. The company also now offers interpretation services for all employees who request it.
WorkSafe representatives and Woods Glass recently met to discuss the EU’s completion.
The company’s Operations Manager Tim Reilly said the process was laborious but rewarding.
“Going through the EU was a huge investment for our company,” Mr Reilly said. “A huge amount of work went into seeing this process through. As a medium-sized business, the work has been onerous and at times tough – but it has been invaluable.
“Two years on from the incident we [Woods Glass] are different. Our workers speak up when they see unsafe behaviour.
“We have seen a change in health and safety culture ripple through the business and we hope this benefits the wider industry.”
WorkSafe’s Enforceable Undertaking Spokesperson Cordell Weir said the completion of the Woods Glass EU shows the benefit of the process to smaller companies.
“The work completed as part of Woods Glass’ EU will provide long term sustainable health and safety improvements in the workplace, industry and community.
“An EU isn’t meant to be an easy task. A lot of hard work goes on behind the scenes for these companies to see the process completed.
“It’s positive to hear another business has found the benefits of the model outweigh the sometimes arduous work.”
How it works
The voluntary agreement between WorkSafe and the PCBU details actions the latter must undertake to respond to the breach of safety, which is expected to:
Support progressively higher standards of work health and safety.
Remedy the harm caused to any victim(s).
Support WorkSafe to meet its strategic priorities.
An enforceable undertaking is not imposed or offered by WorkSafe, as it is the PCBUs responsibility to express interest for WorkSafe to consider.
Before accepting the application, WorkSafe must complete an investigation into the breach of the HWSA and decide whether prosecution is the appropriate response and if the breach amounts to an offence against section 47  (reckless conduct) of the HSWA. Any breach of section 47 precludes an EU from being accepted.
WorkSafe is New Zealand’s primary workplace health and safety regulator, supporting New Zealanders to return home from work healthy and safe. For more information go to: www.worksafe.govt.nz

Despite what you may have heard, you can still use ladders under new health and safety legislation. However, there are some common sense, but often forgotten, practices you should follow to ensure the safety of you and your team
T he new law doesn’t specify heights at which you should or shouldn’t use a ladder, but it does say you must use equipment that’s appropriate to the task.
If you are performing work at height, you must take action – as far as is reasonably practicable – to protect workers from harm that could come from a fall. Work platforms, scaffolding and towers are all options that help prevent falls.
Ladders should be the last option and only used for lower-risk and short-duration tasks. According to WorkSafe, approximately 70% of falls are from ladders and roofs. The cost of these falls is estimated to be $24 million a year – to say nothing of the human cost.
If you need to use a ladder, here are some quick tips from the team at Site Safe on how to do it safely.
DO:
As much prep work on the ground as possible.
Use a tool belt; don’t put tools on the rungs.
Secure the top and bottom of the ladder to prevent it slipping sideways or falling backwards.
Keep three points of contact.
Stop at the third step from the top of a straight ladder, or ensure you have at least one metre extending past the point you are stepping off from.
Use an industrial-standard ladder in good condition on stable ground.
Ensure the stays and clips are secured on stepladders, place the steps towards your work and avoid side-on loading (like drilling side-on through bricks).
Ensure all working areas and access ways are clean, level, well lit and in good condition.
Remove unwanted material and construction waste regularly from your worksite so it doesn’t accumulate.
Ensure construction materials, power leads, tools and equipment are positioned and secured to avoid creating hazards.
Ensure you wear appropriate safety gear.
DON’T:
Overload.
Overreach.
Work near openings or voids.
Have more than one person on the ladder at one time.

Back in late April, the construction industry tooled up to get back to work. To ensure it was done in the safest way possible industry leaders pulled together to draft a health and safety framework to help keep workers, and the public, safe from Covid-19
Throughout the lockdown, industry representatives were working hard behind the scenes to pull together the health and safety information required to get sites safely up and running as soon as the green light from government was received.
“We needed to ensure everyone in the supply chain got back on their feet to help rebuild New Zealand’s economy,” said Rick Herd, Chief Executive of Naylor Love and a member of the Construction Sector Accord.
“The standards and protocols for levels two and three were developed to give strong assurance to our workers, government and the public that we could do this safely.”
Site Safe Chief Executive Brett Murray says it was heartening to see industry representatives come together to produce the frameworks, including those from the civil, vertical and residential sectors, as well as health and safety organisations Construction Health and Safety NZ (CHASNZ) and Site Safe.
“We wanted our members to be able to get back to work as quickly and as safely as possible,” said Murray. “The frameworks that were developed, which consist of a set of standards and protocols, were in accordance with official advice and designed to help ensure workers, their whānau, and the community are kept as safe as possible.”
Standard-setting body CHASNZ, in consultation with the wider industry, developed an overarching standard to help control the risk of Covid-19.
Two protocols have been developed: one targeted at the civil and vertical sector, and the other at residential.
According to CHASNZ Chief Executive Chris Alderson, the protocols sit underneath that standard and essentially inform the detailed ‘how to’ guidance on managing Covid-19 risks on construction sites around the country.
With input from over 50 businesses – including some of New Zealand’s largest constructors, Civil Contractors NZ, the Vertical Leaders Group, residential leaders, SMEs and unions – the framework has been endorsed by the Construction Sector Accord and was welcomed by all sectors.
“Civil construction is playing a massive part in getting New Zealand back up and running,” Civil Contractors NZ Chief Executive Peter Silcock said.
“We need to be clear on how to keep our people and the public safe. This framework effectively mitigates the risk of Covid-19.”
The protocols and standards were developed to recognise the challenges faced by all parts of the sector, from large contractors to small residential builders.
Registered Master Builders Association Chief Executive David Kelly welcomed the frameworks and said the documents were crucial for the many residential builders looking for guidance on how to do their bit.
“It’s critical that everyone in the industry follows the processes agreed to in this guidance. We need to demonstrate that, as an industry, we can work safely, as no one wants to see us return to Level 4. That means the whole of the industry needs to work together on this.”
The guidance for residential has been produced in English and Mandarin and has been amended for level 2 so make sure you have the latest version, which is available HERE .
Make sure to read thoroughly as some of the answers are in the protocols.

An almost fatal fall sparked a health and safety turnaround at a Christchurch-based plastering company – we look at how they did it
A Properly Plastered employee suffered serious injuries after falling more than four metres, while carrying tools up to the second lift on a standard scaffold. Three years later, he is still unable to return to work and has on-going neck problems and migraines.
Owner and long-time PlaceMakers customer Glenn Munro says the shock of the incident and the investigation that followed sparked a review of Properly Plastered’s health and safety practices, which has since revolutionised the way he and his crews approach their work.
“After meeting with the family, and the WorkSafe investigation, we had to have a good look at ourselves,” says Glenn. “When you are sitting there answering ‘no’ to that many questions, you know you have to sort yourselves out.”
In the aftermath of the Christchurch earthquakes and the building boom that followed, the team had grown from five to about 30 and its approach to health and safety had simply failed to keep up with the growing business, says Glenn.
“What WorkSafe said to me was that our health and safety system was ‘okay’, but it hadn’t grown with the size of our business – and that’s what we’ve gone about doing now.”
Since the incident, Glenn has turned to Site Safe for support and now invests heavily in health and safety training, with almost half his staff completing training above passport level. Another three, including Glenn, hope to graduate with the Certificate in Construction Site Safety later this year.
The team had been eager to take on the extra measures and additional training, he says.
“The bulk of them were involved in the near-death situation, so it was easy to get their buy-in. They want to know we are doing something to prevent it from happening again. A lot of them see that we care about them and want them to go home to their families in one piece.”
The crews are now vigilant about using health and safety software to build site-specific safety plans (SSSP) and record incidents.
“We noticed just how much stuff we were missing, like scaffolds not tagged, whereas previously we’d just jumped on. Now the first thing the crews are thinking about is doing an assessment – and SSSP becomes a tool in that respect.”
The fall was the first serious injury in the company’s 20-year history, and Glenn is determined it will be the last.
“The first thing we do on site now is to fill out an SSSP, have a look and make sure things are right. Hopefully with what we’ve put in place, the boys are doing it right every time.”

Under New Zealand’s Health and Safety in Employment law, employers are advised to adopt “all practicable steps” to ensure site safety. Given this is a relatively vague term, Site Safe has outlined what these steps could be.
A hazard is an activity or event that could cause harm. When assessing a hazard, the following must be considered:
The nature and severity of any injury or harm that may occur.
The degree of risk or probability of injury or harm occurring.
How much is known about the hazard and the ways of eliminating, isolating or minimising it.
The availability and cost of safeguards.
Identify the hazard.
Eliminate, isolate, or (as a last option) minimise the hazard.
Train and supervise your employees to deal with hazards.
Engage your employees – alert them to any known hazards and encourage them to inform you of any other hazards they see.
Register all accidents and incidents and understand the hazard.
Investigate accidents, so you can determine the root cause and then improve your health and safety systems where needed.
The following three health and safety tools will not only help manage the hazard but also engage your employees in health and safety.
Used by employers and contractors to list onsite hazards and how they will be controlled.
Used by employees and subcontractors to inform their employers or main contractor of any new hazards – workers should be encouraged to report hazards.
Used to induct new people onto site, to make them aware of onsite hazards.
A hazard register should be submitted and approved before commencing work.
Hazards listed should be checked regularly and kept up to date as situations change.
List of onsite hazards displayed on a board at a site’s entrance.
The board is simple, easy to read and reminds workers of the hidden and obvious hazards on site.
The board should encourage all subcontractors/employees to flag the hazards associated with their tasks, so other people on site are made aware.
The hazard board should be updated daily.
Also known as a ‘method statement’ – your step-by-step guide on how to carry out a task safely.
Details a specific task’s hazards, rather than listing the hazards and controls that are on a particular site.
To create a task analysis, systematically go through a task, outline each step, list the potential significant hazards associated with that step and explain how each hazard can be controlled.
Task analysis increases productivity, as it ensures the right person, plant and process is used and engages staff with health and safety.
It should be completed prior to starting work and be reviewed and approved by the main contractor onsite.
“Engage your employees – alert them to any known hazards and encourage them to inform you of any other hazards they see
Identifying and controlling hazards is only the start. It’s also important to make sure your workers are trained, supervised and/or competent to carry out tasks onsite. If an accident or incident does occur, it is also  important to investigate and register the event – and learn from it to improve your health and safety system.
If your task is deemed ‘notifiable work’, you must notify the MBIE Central Response Team in the following ways by going to www.business.govt.nz/healthandsafety , calling 0800 20 90 20, or emailing healthsafety.notification@dol.govt.nz
Notifiable work in construction:
(a) Any restricted work, as that term is defined in regulation 2(1) of the Health and Safety in Employment (Asbestos) Regulations 1998. (b) Any construction work of one or more of the following kinds:
Where workers could fall 5 m or more, excluding work on a two-storey house, or work on a power or telephone line, or work carried out from a ladder only, or maintenance or repair work of a minor or routine nature.
The erection or dismantling of scaffolds from which a person could fall 5 m or more.
Every excavation more than 1.5 m deep, in which people are required to work and which is deeper than it is wide at the top.
Any form of tunnel or drive where workers are underground, irrespective of timbering or support.
Excavations where the excavated face is steeper than 1 horizontal to 2 vertical.
Any construction work where explosives are used or stored.
Work such as diving, where construction workers breathe air or any other gas that has been compressed or is under pressure.
Lifts of half a tonne (500 kg) or more, a vertical distance of 5 m or more, carried out by use of a lifting appliance other than by a mobile crane, excavator or forklift.
The Site Safe NZ Inc website offers free downloads of hazard registers and task analysis forms (found within the Site Specific Safety Plan document), and Hazard Boards for purchase. For more information about Site Safe NZ Inc services, or to speak to a Safety Advisor, contact 0800 SITE SAFE or visit www.sitesafe.org.nz .

Eye injuries are common among those working in construction – they can cost a lot both in terms of lost time and income, and the very personal cost of being blinded for life
Between July 2014 and June 2015, there were 7,177 eye-related injury claims lodged with ACC that occurred in commercial, industrial and service sites. The total cost of these injuries was $2.6 million.
Eye protection falls into the personal protective equipment (PPE) category, alongside steel-capped boots, hi-vis clothing, earmuffs and hard hats.
The two major reasons workers experience eye injuries on the job are because they are not wearing eye protection, or are wearing protection inappropriate for the job.
Some of the common reasons given for not wearing eye protection, include:
“I forgot” or “I lost them”.
The worker feels or thinks they look silly wearing certain types of eye protection.
The lenses are scratched, dirty, fog up, or are unserviceable.
The eye protection doesn’t fit properly.
The worker gets a headache from wearing eye protection.
The worker normally wears prescription glasses and didn’t have suitable ‘over glasses’ available.
To make the correct decision as to what type of protective eyewear should be worn, you need a thorough understanding of the potential hazards in each workplace.
The key hazards are:
Biological (hepatitis, HIV etc) from blood or other bodily fluids.
Chemicals (splashes, fumes).
Projectiles (concrete, metal, wood and other objects, such as staples, nails or shards of broken material).
Radiation (visible light, ultraviolet radiation, heat, or infrared radiation and lasers).
Once you’ve identified the hazards, you can make the right choice from the range of safety eyewear available. Sometimes, you might need more than one kind.
Non-prescription and prescription safety glasses – these can look a lot like normal glasses or sunglasses, but are tougher, and designed to protect the eye from a range of hazards. Safety glasses are generally better for protecting from projectile hazards and radiation such as UV sunlight.
Safety goggles – these provide the same protection as glasses, but with better protection for chemical or biological hazards.
Face shields – good for high impact projectile protection and for workers exposed to chemicals, heat and biological pathogens.
Helmets – best for use near hazardous radiation, such as welding, and when grinding or working with molten metals.
Here are three simple steps that can ensure the safety of everyone’s sight onsite:
Conduct a risk assessment – find out what hazards exist on your work site.
Provide the right protective equipment for the various tasks – make sure they fit each worker comfortably.
Make wearing eye protection compulsory – this really works!

Summer doesn’t just run from December to February, it often starts in February and can end after April! This year has been unusually dry so far, which brings an increased risk of dehydration and dust exposure on construction sites
The perks of summer include long hours of daylight and truck loads of fine weather. Unfortunately, the summer and early autumn months typically have higher accident rates.
For starters, more construction work is undertaken, often over longer hours. In addition, the dry and hot conditions increase dust exposure and dehydration. A combination of these conditions can result in fatigue and create long-term health problems.
To keep yourself and others safe, you can start with reducing dust exposure. You should also make shade and hydration a priority on your work site.
Breathing in dust can have both acute and chronic effects, potentially causing long term-health issues for builders.
Dust is generated by:
Cutting, sanding, grinding, sweeping and polishing.
Old lead pipes (lead oxide dust).
Stripping out fibrous insulation, lagging or packing materials (potentially asbestos).
A dry and exposed work site.
Wind and heat.
In dry weather, the circulation of dust in the air increases. Eliminating all traces of dust during a job is near impossible, but you can reduce its presence and impact.
Take sand, for example. It can be fatal when breathed into your lungs over time and, if it’s one of your key building materials, on a windy day your product is literally flying away.
Long-term exposure to silica dust – a major component of beach sand and granite – can cause silicosis. Cutting fibre cement and ACCP also exposes people to silicosis.
Silicosis is a specific form of lung disease, caused by an accumulation of silica dust in the lungs.
Any level of silica exposure can result in silicosis. There are three types of silicosis: acute, accelerated, and chronic.
Acute silicosis forms a few weeks or months after high levels of silica exposure. This condition progresses rapidly.
Accelerated silicosis comes on five to ten years after exposure.
Chronic silicosis occurs ten years or longer after silica exposure. Even low exposure levels can cause chronic silicosis.
“Construction work involves a lot of high-risk activities; workers need to be physically and mentally alert
Silica dust particles act as tiny blades on the lungs. When silica is inhaled through the nose or mouth, particles create small cuts that can scar the lung tissue. Scarred lungs do not open and close as well, making breathing difficult.
Testing for it is difficult, so prevention for yourself and others is important. Symptoms to watch out for include:
Frequent dry coughing.
Shortness of breath.
Wheezing.
Increased tiredness.
Keep yourself and others safe by preventing exposure to dust where possible, or at least control it.
Reduce and eliminate dust by:
Spraying surfaces with water.
Covering piles of sand or gravel outdoors.
Extracting (using tools with extraction systems or ventilation machines).
Cleaning regularly; when cleaning and sweeping the site, you can reduce air-borne dust with water and/or using a vacuum.
Use personal protective equipment, such as:
Respiration equipment with instructions for correct use (either reusable or disposable).
Eyewear to protect you from harmful airborne particles.
Water makes up 62% of our bodies. It’s really important to stay hydrated for a successful day’s hard work.
Construction work involves a lot of high-risk activities; workers need to be physically and mentally alert. When you’re working and sweating, it’s more important than ever to make sure you stay hydrated.
Dehydration causes fatigue, headaches and short tempers, which can cause:
Accidents.
Resource and cash wastage.
Equipment damage.
Decreased productivity.
To keep everyone working at peak performance, we recommend:
Regular breaks with readily available water.
Covering the working area, if possible – this could be achieved with shade cloth.
Doing heavier work during cooler periods, if possible.
Covered areas can heat up – have a few fans set up to circulate some fresh air.
Keeping an eye on yourself and the people around you – if feeling dizzy or fatigued, take a break from the sun and have a drink of water.
Whatever your project, making sure it is safe during these hot months is essential to your success.
To keep things moving smoothly on your work site, and to improve the health of yourself, your workers and your bottom line, you should eliminate/control dust as much as you can, keep everyone hydrated and ensure work areas are well ventilated.

TITLE   : Safety net safety alert!

This WorkSafe Safety Alert highlights the serious health and safety risks for workers when using poorly installed safety nets as protection against a fall from height
Over the past year, WorkSafe has been notified of three incidents involving the failure of safety nets for workers working at heights. These incidents resulted in workers being injured – some very seriously.
A fall from height can cause serious harm to a worker (or any other person). Installing a safety net below a work area at height reduces the chance a worker will be harmed if they fall.
“Safety nets are a great safety option for two reasons: people working at height can work more efficiently without more cumbersome safety methods, such as harnesses, and the likelihood of injury in case of a fall is significantly reduced,” says sector lead for construction Vadim Spice.
“However, if the safety net is faulty – due to poor installation, wear, etc – it can cause more harm than good, as workers may be less careful due to their perceived safety.”
These recent incidents reiterate the importance of ensuring safety nets are set up correctly.
What we know
In each of the incidents we have investigated, the failure fell into two categories: incorrect installation or noncompliant product.
The above image shows a bracket that was installed into a non-load-bearing structure/knotted wood, causing the bracket to break away when a worker fell into the net
Some of the key failures we found have been:
Nets that are well below an acceptable standard for use on site.
Installation by untrained installers.
Nets not coupled correctly when multiple nets are used in a large room.
Nets being uninstalled and reinstalled by untrained workers on site.
Nets not being installed to allow for deflection (installed too tight or too loose).
Brackets not being installed to withstand shock loading.
Brackets being installed into nonload-bearing structures/knotted wood, causing the bracket to pull/break away if a worker falls into the net.
Tek screws failing due to poor installation technique/over torqueing/re-use of screws.
Worksafe advice
Safety nets are designed to progressively deflect (stretch) and absorb the energy of a fall, so a falling person is less likely to be injured. The greater the fall height, the greater the impact, so the net’s deflection must also be greater.
The safety net must be able to deform or deflect enough to absorb all of the energy when someone falls – up to the maximum fall height for the design.
For the supplier
Ensure that any nets you supply meet the appropriate standards for New Zealand.
Provide clients with standard operating procedures or instructions for installation.
Ensure that the equipment you are supplying is in sound condition before each use.
Ensure that your installers are trained and competent (and you are assessing and monitoring their work/auditing their installation).
Ensure that the nets are adequate and fi t for purpose for each job.
Talk to your clients about the suitability of nets as fall protection.
For the installer
Follow the instructions for installation.
Ensure safe methods of work are followed.
Ensure the correct use of anchorage devices/foundations and that they are suitable for the application (designed to a standard/engineered specifications – that they will withstand the amount of force if a person falls).
Ensure that clients are clearly informed on the correct use and limitations of the equipment, including the need to have installers reinstall nets after a fall, or where nets have been partially removed.
For the client
Plan your workflow to ensure height safety equipment arrives at the best time.
Make sure that you communicate the full extent of your needs to the net supplier.
Ensure the equipment supplied is suitable for your work.
Ensure you/your workers are aware of the use and limitations of the equipment, and it’s fi t for your purpose.
Ensure that nets are reinstated by a competent person after an alteration or fall.

When installing roof trusses, sufficient fall protection will help ensure the job’s done with minimum risk.
When planning roof truss installation, it pays from a safety point of view to think about using the work at height three-point system – Eliminate, Isolate, Minimise – to manage the risk.
While not commonplace in New Zealand, prefabrication on the ground allows completed sections, or even whole roofs, to be craned into place, thus greatly reducing the need for people to be working at height. This should be done whenever possible.
A safe working platform will be required around the perimeter of the building to fix the trusses into position on the wall plate.
At no time is any person to stand on or work from an external wall top plate without suitable fall protection.
If prefabrication is not possible and trusses are assembled in situ, a safe working platform – such as a scaffold – should be provided around the perimeter of the roof.
Measures to prevent or mitigate the distance of a fall must also be provided internally. This can be achieved by providing a working platform or ‘crash deck’ immediately beneath the underside of the trusses.
Either conventional scaffolding, or, if appropriate, proprietary decking systems can be used for this. Safety mesh or other safety-rated products that can span across the top of the framing can also be used.
If a safe working platform cannot be provided, safety nets can be used if there is a safe clearance distance below the net and a suitable fixing point can be achieved.
Alternatives to nets are soft landing systems, such as bean bags or air bags. In some circumstances, a safe clearance distance can be achieved by locating bracing of the framing on the outside of the structure.
Providing nets or soft landing systems is also particularly important when installing temporary or permanent bracing, or before boarding out along the bottom chord of trusses, when access is required within the trusses. Any equipment used to gain access to higher levels of the truss should be properly designed and stable.
Working platforms can be supported by the truss members, if they are stable and capable of sustaining the load. Guard rails should be provided, unless truss members provide a similar standard of protection. Work below should be prohibited, unless workers are protected from falling materials.
” If prefabrication is not possible and trusses are assembled in situ, a safe working platform – such as a scaffold – should be provided around the perimeter of the roof
Systems such as nets or air bags and bean bags should only be relied on where a working platform to the standard described above is not feasible.
Where a working platform is used:
Attachment points must be fit for purpose – check that the supporting structure is capable of resisting the expected anchorage loads.
Seek advice from the manufacturer/installer.
The risk of injury during the fall – eg striking rafters or blockwork – must be carefully assessed.
Working platforms should be provided, where possible, in addition to the measures taken to arrest a fall.

Changes to the Health and Safety Reform Bill aim to clarify who is in the best position to control workplace health and safety. Here, WorkSafe New Zealand provides an update on the bill as it moves through parliament
The Health and Safety Reform Bill introduces the concept of a Person Conducting a Business or Undertaking (PCBU).
PCBUs are considered to be in the best position to control risks to work health and safety, precisely because they are the ones carrying out the business or undertaking. This is why the PCBU will have the primary duty under the new law.
A PCBU will usually be a business entity, such as a company, rather than an individual person. A person might be a PCBU if they are a sole trader or a self-employed person.
Examples include:
Retailers.
Wholesalers.
Manufacturers.
Importers.
Owner-drivers of their own business.
A fast food franchisor and the operator of the fast food outlet (the franchisee).
A self-employed person operating their own business.
A government department.
A local council.
A school.
A partnership.
A building company, including principal contractors and sub-contractors.
A not-for-profit organisation that employs admin staff.
Definition of a business or undertaking:
A business is an enterprise usually conducted to make a profit, with a degree of organisation, systems and continuity.
An undertaking may have some degree of organisation, systems and continuity, but is usually not profit-making or commercial in nature.
PCBU is a broad concept that reflects modern working arrangements.
The current Health and Safety in Employment Act 1992 primarily focuses on the employer and employee roles. It places duties on carefully defined participants – employers, principals, the self-employed, persons controlling a place of work and suppliers of plant.
The PCBU concept replaces all of them. It better reflects the complex nature of the modern workplace, where there can be multiple working arrangements for workers in the same location and/or working for the same organisation.
The PCBU concept recognises that a business or undertaking has an influence over the health and safety of workers, even those it may not directly employ.
Clause 13 of the Bill sets out the meaning of a PCBU. You’re not a PCBU if you are:
Employed or engaged solely as a worker or an officer (for example a company director) of the business or undertaking.
A householder where you engage or employ someone solely to do residential work on or in your home.
The PCBU concept captures the full range of duty holders in the modern work environment.
The question people should ask is not “Am I a duty holder?” but rather “I am a duty holder, what can I reasonably do to meet my duty?”
All PCBUs have a primary duty of care to ensure the health and safety of workers, and others, affected by the work carried out by the PCBU.
Still not sure who the PCBU is? Check out some of the scenarios below:
Kitchen Construction Limited (KCL) operates a small business, which specialises in the building and renovation of kitchens. Simon is the sole director. KCL employs several full-time staff and regularly contracts Todd, a self-employed electrician.
KCL is a PCBU conducting the business of building and renovating kitchens.
KCL’s employees are workers of KCL.
Simon is an officer of KCL.
Todd is a PCBU, in his own right, conducting his electrician business.
When engaged by KCL to complete electrical work on KCL’s projects, Todd is a worker of KCL.
Mary owns a small lifestyle block. She wants chickens and a large garden to provide fresh eggs and vegetables for her family of eight. The property is not connected to the town water supply, and Mary has engaged Maximum Plumbing Limited (MPL) to upgrade the house’s plumbing to install a secondary water tank to ensure that there is enough water to go around. Three plumbers from MPL will be working in and around Mary’s home for several days to finish the upgrade.
As Mary has engaged MPL only to undertake residential work on her home, she is not a PCBU.
MPL is a PCBU. It is in the business of providing plumbing services and owes a duty of care to ensure its workers, and others (including Mary), are not put at risk by the work undertaken to upgrade the house’s plumbing.
Main image: As a PCBU, you have a duty to ensure the health and safety of all staff working on your site – even those you don’t employ directly

With temperatures dropping, it’s time to think about protecting yourself and your team from the cold
Winter weather can lead to more injuries, as colder temperatures can affect decision-making. For example, workers may take shortcuts to finish a job  quicker so they can get out of the elements. These shortcuts may lead to people getting hurt, as well as damage being done to plant and equipment.
Site Safe Christchurch Safety Advisor Trudy Hodge knows all about working in chilly conditions. Canterbury can have some tough, frosty mornings and Trudy says warming up before getting into any hard yakka is always useful in avoiding cold-start injuries.
“Stretching and moving the body’s mechanical workings before digging and lifting is always a good idea.”
She adds that starting with one of the easier jobs of the day is a productive way to warm up.
Even moderately cold temperatures can increase the risk of workplace incidents as the cold reduces manual dexterity, fingertip sensitivity and muscle strength.
People working outside should try to eliminate, or at best minimise, cold hazards.
The following areas are key to weathering winter well.
Personal protective equipment
Clothing should be worn in multiple layers. The bottom layer can be a range of materials including polypropylene, polyester or wool.
The outer layer should be hi-vis, rain and wind-proof and allow for easy opening and removal.
Trudy says that with layering, it is vital to get the base layer next to the skin.
“Good thermals that draw the sweat away from the body are a godsend. There are many brands on the market, but remember, you get what you pay for!
“If you can afford it, merino is excellent for warmth and keeping the skin dry.”
It has the bonus, for the extra  hard-working people, of being low on the odour scale, which is never a bad thing in the smoko room.
Food, shelter and wellbeing
Food and liquid intake are essential to maintain body heat and prevent dehydration, particularly as the body is working harder in cold conditions.
WorkSafe says if continuous work is carried out in temperatures below 0°C, heated shelters such as cabins or smoko rooms should be available.
A strict timetable for breaks should be put in place to allow employees to warm up and change clothes if needed.
Always have a hot brew on hand. Tea, coffee, Milo, or a herbal tea will keep that core temperature up.
Training
Employees should be informed about appropriate PPE, safe work practices and emergency procedures in case of injury. While working in the cold, a buddy system should be used to look out for one another.
Workers and supervisors should be trained to recognise the symptoms of cold exposure, such as hypothermia. Having a trained first aid person is also highly recommended.
Site Safe Wellington Safety Advisor Jenni Maxwell says early indications of workers being affected by the cold include slower reaction times and being slower at doing their work.
“When the body is exposed to cold temperatures, effects can include dehydration, numbness, shivering and – in very cold weather – possibly frostbite.”
Exposed areas such as the head, hands and feet are just as important as the body. Gloves are an obvious option; however, these can become bulky and affect a worker’s manual handling, so a better option may be to provide warm air blowers or insulated handles on tools.
Buy footwear that is well padded, insulated and made from a breathable material such as leather. A great deal of heat is also lost through the head; a problem compounded by the fact that hard hats do not provide protection against the cold.
If a hard hat is necessary, wear a tightly fitted beanie made of polypropylene or merino underneath.
Equipment
The risk of cold injury can be minimised by equipment choice and design. Plant, equipment and tools should be designed so that they can be operated without having to remove items of PPE.
The more complex or fiddly the activity, the greater the likelihood that PPE will be discarded during the process, which leads to increased risk.
Plan
To avoid harsh winter conditions, plan work that is appropriate to the weather. Check weather reports before planning your jobs, so that outside tasks can be done on the best possible day.
If you cannot be adequately protected from the effects of the cold, then work must be suspended or rescheduled to remove the risk of harm.
Following these steps will ensure that winter does not slow you down and everyone stays productive, happy and keen.

A recent study conducted by BRANZ has shed light on mental health issues within the construction industry, offering some important insights to help tackle the issue
At 6.9%, the proportion of suicides in the New Zealand construction industry stands as the highest across all other sectors in the country.
Despite a mixed reaction from interviewees being surprised or not surprised at the rate of suicides, nearly all were unaware that the construction sector had the highest percentage of all industries.
What’s fuelling the numbers
Workplace culture, boom and bust trends, and communication issues were just some of the areas construction workers reported as causing mental distress, as reported by industry workers.
A culture that stigmatises mental illness and promotes a ‘harden up’ attitude were also common themes raised by respondents.
A staunch workplace culture was attributed to making it difficult for workmates to have a conversation about sensitive topics such as mental health, therefore making it harder to suggest places to get help.
Another workplace culture concern frequently mentioned by interviewees was bullying. However, there was a common understanding that there were improvements being made in that area, with tolerance for such behaviour decreasing.
The boom and bust nature of the industry was also said to be causing distress for employers and employees alike. Interestingly, the boom period was said by some to be the more mentally distressing period, due to an abundance of work opportunities and insufficient labourers resulting in long hours, fatigue and a poor work/life balance.
Intergenerational differences in communication was also a source of tension, with some describing how older workers would harass apprentices as part of a ritualised initiation.
On the other end, older workers believed younger workers were more sensitive and required a supportive approach when giving feedback. They said such a disconnect between generations can lead to interpersonal conflicts and additional stress at work.
Other factors believed to create mental distress in the construction sector were drug and alcohol use, pressures created by better-informed customers, intolerance of diversity, and high-risk individuals in the industry.
The impact on the industry
Interviewees agreed that mental distress in the workplace had a negative impact on health and safety in general, with the phenomenon of ‘presenteeism’ inviting more risks. Presenteeism involves workers turning up mentally or physically unwell, so distractions and lethargy that accompany mental distress are more likely to contribute to an accident or near miss in the workplace.
These effects on a worker’s ability to perform at their best results in lower productivity and increasing costs, reinforcing a vicious cycle of pressure and stress.
Calling on mates
Facing the same problem in its own construction industry, Australia has developed a wellness programme called MATES in Construction, which encourages and facilitates help-seeking behaviour.
Set up as an industry-owned charity, the programme looks to increase help-seeking behaviour by educating workers on site and training volunteers to act as ‘connectors’, who are able to offer suicide first aid.
MATES and Scentre Group are looking to work with the New Zealand construction industry and WorkSafe to bring the programme across the ditch.
WorkSafe has expressed strong interest in supporting the pilot of MATES in Construction in New Zealand, with the need to evaluate its efficacy.
Evaluation of the programme will require more statistics on mental health in the industry in order to track its progress. Evaluating the programme will also allow it to best serve its target demographic.
When asked who should drive the research into the performance of the wellness programme, most respondents supported a partnership approach between the industry and a research organisation such as BRANZ. There were some respondents who also suggested the health sector be involved in future research.
Outlining the problem before offering help
Many interviewees in the BRANZ research were from organisations that were already addressing mental health in the industry through a wellness approach. Each example provided by interviewees where wellness programmes were offered showed that there had been no uptake from members of industry organisations.
At events discussing the importance of wellness, industry audiences responded saying they didn’t see a need for such programmes. This reflects a big contrast to the sentiment of interviewees during the BRANZ study, which suggested that one reason for the lack of reception to wellness programmes is that there is no understanding that there is a problem to begin with.
As a result, the BRANZ research suggests presenting the problem first and highlighting the financial and social costs of mental distress may justify the need for industry members to invest in wellness programmes.

E very year, hundreds of New Zealand workers are seriously injured due to falls from height at work – some of them fatally.
The cost of these falls is estimated to be $24 million a year in ACC claims – and that doesn’t even touch the human cost of losing a loved one, a valued worker and a member of the community.
Looking at the statistics, construction injuries and fatalities do not paint a pretty picture. When we break them down, we can see that falls from height continue to be responsible for an unacceptable number of serious injuries reported to the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE). More than half of these are falls from less than three metres, most commonly off ladders or from single-storey roofs.
In February last year, MBIE launched the Preventing Falls from Height campaign to address this issue. This was followed by the launch of the Best Practice Guidelines for Working at Height in New Zealand.
“While there has been some resistance from parts of the construction sector about the cost of scaffolding, any of the companies we talk to are now seeing that initial cost being offset by productivity gains” – Marcus Nalter, MBIE
One year on, the Ministry is seeing builders, roofers and other tradesmen taking positive steps to manage the hazard of working at height.
“A number of companies are now using scaffolding as their preferred option to ensure workers are safe,” says Preventing Falls from Height project team leader Marcus Nalter.
“While there has been some resistance from parts of the construction sector about the cost of scaffolding, many of the companies we talk to are now seeing that initial cost being offset by productivity gains. Builders can move around a site with greater ease and confidence and that ease of access continues to benefit other trades such as painters and spouting installers as work progresses on the site.”
The project team has been collecting success stories from companies around the country, which have reported increased productivity and other benefits stemming from the use of height safety systems. These stories will be shared on the Ministry’s website to showcase how small and large companies alike can benefit from a safer working environment.
This changing mind-set is particularly important as we move forward with the Canterbury rebuild. As the construction work quickly moves ahead, it is crucial we do not lose sight of the importance of keeping our workers safe and healthy – and protect them from the hazards of working from height. Unless everyone commits to making the rebuild safe, we risk lost lives and injured workers.
Based on the estimated number of workers involved in the rebuild effort through to 2018, and the Canterbury construction industry’s health and safety record to date, if we don’t continue to make health and safety a priority we could see:
One to two construction-related fatalities in each year of the rebuild.
Ill health and fatalities through exposure to workplace contaminants and other hazards.
600,000 working days lost through workplace injury and illness.
$80 million in ACC entitlements.
This is unacceptable. Rebuilding Canterbury safely is a top priority for the Ministry. That’s why it is working closely with industry, government departments, employers and workers’ representatives.
“The new agency will have a dedicated focus on health and safety and be committed to ensuring people are well protected from injury and death when they go to work each day
As the rebuild and the project progress, MBIE and the Government have made changes to improve New Zealand’s health and safety performance.
In February, labour minister Simon Bridges announced that the Government would establish a new, standalone workplace health and safety agency to significantly improve New Zealand’s workplace health and safety record.
The creation of a standalone Crown agent was a key recommendation of both the Royal Commission on the Pike River Coal Mine Tragedy and the Independant Taskforce on Workplace Health and Safety.
The new agency will have a dedicated focus on health and safety and be committed to ensuring people are well protected from injury and death when they go to work each day.
“This is a significant step in the Government’s workplace health and safety reform programme,” Mr Bridges said. “It reflects the Government’s strong commitment to addressing New Zealand’s workplace fatality and serious injury rates. We have a firm target of a 25% reduction of these rates by 2020.”
The new agency will enforce workplace health and safety regulations and work collaboratively with employers and employees to embed and promote good workplace health and safety practices.
The Preventing Falls from Height project will continue, supported by the Lifting Our Game programme, which focuses on improving the way in which health and safety regulations are developed and enforced.
From 1 July, there will be a new Health and Safety Inspectorate with new specialist roles, responsibilities and a new way of working. There are currently 139 health and safety inspectors; that number will increase to 158. Lifting capability at the frontline and building the systems, processes and tools to be effective is key to ensuring the success of these harm-reduction projects.

An investment in your employees’ training is an investment in your business; upskilling will improve their competency, your business’ overall performance and its health and safety levels
One of the five key areas of a good health and safety system is training and competence. To carry out work safely, teams need to be competent and use the correct equipment. Sometimes, a level of supervision is also required. To ensure appropriate support on the job can take place, make sure this information is noted down in a register. Another use for the training and competency register is to allow employers to see the holes in their employees’ training and skills.
It’s important for company directors to recognise that upskilling staff is about more than just meeting legal requirements – it’s about investing in the business. Competent employees are less likely to injure themselves and more likely to feel motivated and loyal, because they feel valued.
Training is most effective when it’s relevant to the work and the employee.  First work out the skills needed for the business and then see if employees meet the skills required. Staff should be involved in the process of selecting training to ensure it is thorough and to get their support.
Break each job down into tasks and work out the specific skills, equipment and materials needed for each one.
Clearly identify the existing skills and competencies of employees. This can be carried out by a review of past training, a discussion to test their knowledge base and by observing their work.
Decide how to best fill the skill and competency gap. You can refer to specific regulations, best practice guides, different training providers or ask your local Site Safe advisor for help.
Look to your team to provide training in their area of expertise. Get them to do a mini training session on different parts of their work or pieces of equipment – this way, employees can also learn from each other. A buddy system is also a very effective method of gaining knowledge.
Competence = knowledge + training + experience
Site Safe’s Site Specific Safety Plan (SSSP), which is free to download, has a training and competency register to help you record and map out your employees’ skill levels. Head to www.sitesafe.org.nz/sssp to download your free SSSP.

Safety is something that can easily slip off the radar – especially after an extended Christmas break – so start the year off right by reminding your staff or yourself, to adhere to some simple but essential safety procedures.
No one sets out to have a work accident, but the simple fact is that building sites contain all sorts of hazards that are accidents waiting to happen. Many of us may not be aware of what the hazards are, or we may become so involved in the task we’re doing that we overlook the hazards and the risk they pose to us.
As a result, injuries in the construction industry are high. In 2012, ACC made payments of more than $81 million for over 50,000 new or existing claims in the construction industry alone. Remember, taking steps to make your workplace safer and managing the hazards can save you a lot of pain, time and money.
Focusing on the welfare of people in your workplace is good for business all round – it can avoid the human and business costs of workplace injuries, improve productivity and avoid the costs and negative impacts of an injury, such as an employee absence, or an official investigation.
“In 2012, ACC made payments of more than $81 million for over 50,000 new or existing claims in the construction industry alone.
Here are some simple tips and advice to help reduce your risk of injuries in and around a building site:
Lifting, carrying and straining were cause for almost 6,000 new and ongoing claims in the construction industry in 2012. To avoid becoming part of this statistic, follow these tips:
Use mechanical load shifting devices, such as cranes, hoists and hand trucks to move materials around the worksite.
Fit temporary lifting points or handles to heavy or awkward loads.
If manual lifting is required, make sure you have enough workers available to complete the task, remembering the old saying ‘many hands make light work’.
If you’re working in a noisy environment, use hearing protection. In 2012, noise-induced hearing loss resulted in over 8,000 new and ongoing claims in the construction industry, with more than $4 million being paid out.
Hearing loss is permanent but you can prevent it by following these tips:
If you can’t hear someone talk when you are 1-2 metres apart, you need hearing protection, and so do they.
Ensure that hearing protection is supplied and used at all times.
Even short periods without wearing hearing protection will damage your hearing. For example, five minutes operating a circular saw will damage your hearing.
Make sure your hearing protection is effective – it needs to be in good condition, you need to know how to wear itcorrectly, and it needs to be the correct class of hearing protection for the type of work you are doing.
Check noisy tools to ensure they are well maintained and, when possible, separate workers from noisy activities.
Place warning signs in areas of excessive noise – that’s anything above 85 decibels, which is the level of noise you hear when you are hammering a nail or using a hand saw.
In 2012, loss of balance and falls relating to ladders and stepladders saw $5.1 million in payments made for new and ongoing injury claims.
Here are some tips to avoid having this happen on your worksite:
Use the most effective levels of ‘falls protection’ measures available such as scaffolding, guard railing and appropriate physical barriers.
Ensure that your building site’s working areas and access ways are clear of any obstructions that may lead to an accident.
Where possible, use mechanical equipment like scissor lifts, which allow work to occur without reaching.
Provide safe access to upper floors.
Keep work and access areas clear.
Remove unwanted materials and construction waste from the work site, so that it does not accumulate.
Ensure all power leads and other tools and equipment are positioned so as not to cause a tripping hazard.
Avoid attaching bracing across door frames that people are likely to walk through.
In 2012, over 1,000 new injury claims were a result from punctures or cuts with knives, hammers, chainsaws, spanners, axes, slashers, cleavers and hand-held circular chainsaws in the construction industry.
Check that all tool guards function correctly and are safe to use.
Make sure that any exposed nails and other sharp objects are removed or knocked in.
Make sure that all workers wear the appropriate PPE, such as gloves, safety boots and knee protection pads.
Using the right tools for the job is important, but perhaps even more important is knowing how to use them. Only use the tools and equipment that you have been trained to use.
Check all power leads and guards are in good condition.
Always use a residual-current device (R.C.D.) to prevent electrocution, and turn tools off at the power source when done.
Wear the right protective gear – eye and hearing protection, as well as suitable footwear.

Many workplaces have a degree of continuous background noise and it needs to be controlled to avoid damaging people’s hearing
Legally, workplace noise cannot be above an average level of 85 decibels (dB) over an eight-hour period, and a worker may be required to wear hearing protection for the entire time depending on the levels during a job.
A simple test to determine noise levels is to try have a conversation under normal operating conditions. If voices need to be raised, then the damage risk criteria of 85dB has likely been compromised.
Harmful noise exposure can cause hearing impairments such as ‘industrial deafness’ or ‘trauma induced hearing loss’.
Employers are required to take all practicable steps to mitigate noise risk. This typically starts with carrying out a noise survey before work, with the conversation test being a good point to begin.
Nailing noise protection
Here are some methods to help manage and protect against workplace noise:
Understand how long employees will be exposed to the noise.
Find the sources of noise.
Come up with ways to eliminate or minimise the noise.
Decide on appropriate hearing protection.
Use the standard AS/NZS 1269 for guidance on Occupational Noise assessment and management.
Dealing with the noise
Use the hierarchy of controls, as illustrated in the accompanying diagram, to consider how to best eliminate noise hazards. When eliminating noise isn’t possible, take steps to minimise the noise by using substitution, isolation or engineering controls.
If possible, eliminate the noise by changing the process, machinery or equipment used and/or use a different approach to get the job done.
Minimising noise
There are a couple of ways to reduce noise and therefore decrease the risk of hearing damage:
Use sound barriers or build baffles that enclose noisy plant/equipment.
Adapt tools or equipment to reduce the noise risk.
Monitor the health of employees
To ensure your workers are receiving appropriate help and adhering to the safety practices, it is important to:
Arrange hearing tests for all employees who work with hazardous noise. (This must be done by a competent person when an employee starts work and at intervals no longer than 12 months)
Provide information, training, and supervision to staff in relation to noise hazards in the workplace.
Educate workers on the dangerous effects of noise and how they can protect themselves from the hazard.
Ensure that everyone onsite is wearing hearing protection – especially site leaders.
Points to note:
Damage to hearing is cumulative. If a worker reaches the decibel threshold from one activity during the day, any further noise in the danger zone will cause damage. For example, if they are exposed to a power saw for 30 minutes, the worker can’t be exposed to any other noise level above 85 dB for the rest of the day.
This also applies to noise outside of work. If a worker has reached the safe levels at work, and listens to loud music at home, there is a chance of permanent hearing loss.

Pumping concrete is often required in residential builds and, while builders don’t usually carry out the work themselves, ensuring the site remains safe during the process is everyone’s responsibility.
Pumping is an efficient method of moving and placing concrete, used in the manufacture of pre-cast and tilt-up panels, concrete formwork, slab construction, concrete paving and concrete spraying – and, like any process during a build, safety should be front of mind.
This article provides practical guidance about the health and safety issues of concrete pumping, with guidance for principals, employers, contractors and pump operators (employees or contractors) on how to meet their obligations to provide the safest working environment possible.
Workers in the construction industry use a variety of tools and machinery in the course of their work. A significant hazard of using this equipment, or working near people who use this equipment, is excessive noise.
Prolonged exposure to excessive noise causes permanent hearing loss. It is not a general loss of hearing but the ability to hear some frequencies of sound. It’s a bit like listening to music with the treble control turned all the way down.
Although a person with hearing loss may hear people talking, it becomes more difficult for that person to understand what they are saying.
Continuous exposure to noise above 85dB(A) (an average noise level of 85 decibels over an eight-hour work shift) will cause permanent hearing damage. As a rule, worksite noise exceeds 85dB(A) if conversation at a normal level between people is difficult when standing one metre apart.
Noise is measured on a logarithmic scale instead of a linear scale. This means that if machine A is 85dB and machine B is 88dB, machine B is, in fact, twice as loud as machine A.
On many construction sites, noise levels can be difficult to control. However, if a noise level assessment shows that workplace noise exposure exceeds 85dB(A) over an eight-hour timeframe, the employer must implement hazard controls such as:
Elimination (for example, substituting noisy equipment for less noisy equipment, or using less noisy work processes).
Isolation (for example, noise-reducing booths, where noisy portable work can be conducted).
Minimisation (for example, reducing worker exposure to the noise by conducting noisy work at less busy times of the day or night, increasing employees’ working distances from noise sources, and providing hearing protection and conducting health monitoring).
MBIE has carried out noise tests on common construction tools to give an estimate of how loud they are. See Figure 1 to view noise levels of selected construction tools.
An increase to normal operating noise levels may occur due to sound being reflected back from other structures. Suitable control measures may need to be put in place to ensure that workers in the area are protected. These workers include:
The workers in the affected area.
The concrete pump operators.
The delivery truck drivers.
The operators of other associated equipment.
When positioning the pump, efforts should be made to minimise the effect of the surroundings on the workers’ overall noise exposure.
If workers in affected areas are provided with hearing protection to control exposure to noise, the hearing protection must be worn whenever noiselevels exceed 85dB(A). Atmospheric testing is required when hearing protection is worn, as the noise hazards fluctuate depending upon the work activities.
If concrete pumping equipment is set up in an enclosed or semi-enclosed area, special attention should be given to the hazards created by the build-up of hazardous exhaust vapours, particularly carbon monoxide.
Carbon monoxide (CO) is a deadly poison – it is colourless, odourless and non-irritating. Over 10% of people who have survived high carbon monoxide exposures are left with a permanent brain injury. Carbon monoxide is more likely to build up in enclosed or poorly ventilated areas, where machines using petrol, diesel or gas are operated. All practicable steps must be taken to control this hazard.
Concentration of carbon monoxide in air
Symptoms
35ppm (parts per million)
Headaches and dizziness within six to eight hours of continual exposure
Headache within two to three hours
Headache within two to three hours; loss of judgement
Headache within one to two hours
Headache, dizziness, nausea and convulsions within 45 minutes; unconscious within two hours
Headache, accelerated heart rate, dizziness and nausea within 20 minutes, death in less than two hours
Headache, dizziness and nausea within five to ten minutes; death within 30 minutes
Headache and dizziness in one to two minutes; convulsions, breathing stops, and death in less than 20 minutes
Unconsciousness after two to three breaths; death in less than three minutes.
Controls
Exposure to carbon monoxide from petrol, gas or diesel-powered machinery in confined areas.
Ensure engine exhaust gases from pump and delivery trucks are directed to the open air. Extraction ventilation and breathing apparatus may be required.

If you or your staff are likely to encounter asbestos at work, it’s important you understand the new rules that come into effect on 4 April
A sbestos regulations are being updated to bring New Zealand in line with other countries. With more than 170 New Zealand workers dying each year from asbestos-related diseases, our work practices need to improve.
Under the new regulations, effective 4 April 2016, a licence is required to remove more than 10m2 of non-friable (bonded) asbestos or asbestos-containing material (ACM) in one job, or any amount of friable (in a powder form when dry, or able to be crumbled or reduced to a powder using your hands) asbestos.
The licences will be issued by government health and safety agency, WorkSafe New Zealand.
You can register now with WorkSafe New Zealand to get up-to-date information on the new licensing process, including when and how you can apply. Note that registering does not count as a licence application.
New nationwide licensing system for asbestos removal
The new licensing system for asbestos removal is aimed at ensuring people removing asbestos have the necessary skills and experience to keep themselves, and others, safe.
Licence or no licence?
Here are some common examples of building, plumbing or electrical work, with a guide to whether you’ll need an asbestos removal licence.
Example 1:
Work which may involve the removal of non-friable asbestos:
Soffit removal.
Removing cement roofing sheets.
Removing external wall cladding or textured ceilings.
Replacing lino flooring.
This work will require a Class B licence from 4 April 2016, if you’re removing over 10m2 of non-friable asbestos containing material.
Example 2:
Maintenance and servicing work which may involve ACM:
Repairing or replacing sheets of cement roofing that are damaged or deteriorated.
Replacing damaged or deteriorated cement water pipes.
Drilling or cutting into soffits or wall linings.
Building maintenance or servicing is allowed without a licence under the new regulations. However, if it involves removing more than 10m2 of non-friable asbestos, or any amount of friable asbestos, then a licence is required.
Example 3:
Removal of friable asbestos:
Removal of insulation materials, including lagging.
Any removal task where the asbestos is in a powder form when dry, or able to be crumbled or reduced to a powder using your hands.
This work will require a Class A licence, because the asbestos fibres are friable. This means you could be exposed to larger quantities of airborne fibres.
Note: All removal work needs to be performed safely. Suitable controls need to be in place to ensure that the risks of asbestos have been minimised. These include correct use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), Respiratory Protective Equipment (RPE), safe methods of work, decontamination facilities and the disposal of all asbestos waste in an approved landfill.
What do I need to do?
If your business is likely to require an asbestos removal licence, it’s a good idea to register your interest with WorkSafe.
You can register online, and find more information on changes to work involving asbestos, at http://business.govt.nz/worksafe/asbestos
I have a Certificate of Competence for restricted asbestos work. What do I need to do?
If you have a current Certificate of Competence, you don’t need to do anything yet. Your certificate will allow you to work under the new asbestos regulations (under the categories listed on your current certificate), until your certificate expires.
At that point, you will need to apply for one of the new licences or to work under another business’ licence.

This next article in our mythbusting series looks to clear up further misconceptions
Some in the industry believe that the Health and Safety at Work Act prevents the formation of health and safety committees. This is a myth!
If more than five workers or a health and safety rep asks for a health and safety committee, then the business must consider the request.
If you are in a high-risk industry*, such as construction, or have more than 20 workers, you can only decline the request for a health and safety committee if you believe you are already doing enough to meet your worker participation requirements under the Health and Safety at Work Act.
Remember, all requests must be genuinely considered and valid reasons given for any refusal. Any business can form a health and safety committee voluntarily.
It is important to remember that under the Act, you need to engage with workers and create opportunities for them to take part in improving health and safety. Many businesses choose to have health and safety committees, as they are a well-established way to support worker engagement and participation.
If a health and safety committee is established at your workplace, the business must:
Consult with the committee on health and safety.
Allow each member of the committee sufficient time to attend meetings or carry out functions as a member of the committee.
Provide the committee with necessary information to perform its functions, including information relating to hazards and the health and safety of workers at the workplace.
Adopt any committee recommendation, or provide a written statement advising why they did not adopt it.
*High-risk sectors or industries as per the Health and Safety at Work Act Regulations 2016 include:
Aquaculture
Forestry and logging
Fishing, hunting, and trapping
Coal mining
Food product manufacturing
Water supply, sewerage, and drainage services
Waste collection, treatment, and disposal services
Building construction
Heavy and civil engineering construction
Construction services
Site Safe offers a comprehensive two-day training course to get health and safety reps up to speed. To enrol, visit www.sitesafe.org.nz .

The effects of the cold range from increased risk of injury to a reduction in work rate and quality. So how can you and your business prepare from the adverse effects of winter?
Working outside in harsh conditions doesn’t just take a toll on your staff, there is also a greater potential for damage to plant and equipment.
The cold also affects a worker’s ability to concentrate on the task at hand, and can increase irritability and frustration, which may lead people to take shortcuts to finish faster.
Even moderately cold temperatures can increase the likelihood of workplace incidents. This is because the body’s response to cold causes a decrease in manual dexterity, fingertip sensitivity and muscle strength. The degree of coldness can be underestimated if other factors, such as wind chill, aren’t considered.
Completely eliminating cold hazards can be difficult; therefore, consider the following minimising controls when working in cold conditions:
Food and liquid intake are essential to maintain body heat and prevent dehydration. More energy is exerted working in cold conditions, because the body is working hard to keep warm.
WorkSafe NZ states that if continuous work is carried out in temperatures below 0°C, heated shelters such as cabins or ‘smoko’ rooms should be made available. A strict timetable for breaks should be allowed, so employees can warm up and change clothes if necessary.
Workers and supervisors should be trained to recognise the symptoms of cold exposure, such as hypothermia. Having a trained first aid person is highly recommended. Employees should be informed about PPE, safe work practices and emergency procedures in case of injury.
Clothing should be worn in multiple polypropylene, polyester or Merino layers, because the air between the layers of clothing provides better insulation. The outer layer should be hi-vis, rain and wind-proof and easily opened or removed.
Exposed areas, such as the head, hands and feet, are just as important. Gloves are an obvious option; however, these can be bulky and affect a worker’s manual handling. As an alternative, you should provide warm air blowers or insulated handles on tools.
Buy footwear that is well padded, insulated and made from materials such as leather, which allows the shoes to ‘breathe’.
The risk of cold injury can be minimised by equipment choice and design. Plant, equipment and tools should be designed so that they can be operated without having to remove PPE items. The more complex or fiddly the activity, the greater the likelihood that PPE will be discarded during the process, which increases the risk.
To avoid harsh winter conditions, plan work that is appropriate to the weather. If you cannot be adequately protected from the effects of the cold, then work must be suspended or the regime modified, to remove the risk of harm.

Adjusting to life under the ’new normal’ may be challenging. In the construction sector, it has meant getting to grips with the additional safety protocols designed to prevent the spread of Covid-19
This can be even more challenging when there are multiple trades on site at the same time. So, what happens if you and your team are doing your bit to prevent the spread but someone else on site isn’t? Site Safe looks at your rights, responsibilities, and when it might be necessary to speak up.
If you have concerns that the actions of workers from another PCBU (see definition below) may be putting you or others at risk – eg, not following good hygiene practices such as washing or sanitising hands – you should treat this like any other health and safety issue you may encounter on your site.
In a nutshell, under New Zealand’s health and safety law, the main contractor/PCBU (person conducting a business or undertaking – note this is a legal term for the business and it can mean an organisation or an individual) in charge of the site has a responsibility to ensure that all those on site have good health and safety practices in place and that the work of their contractors is not putting anyone – including the public – at risk.
The Covid-19 situation is no different from any other health and safety issue in that way. Generally, workers don’t deliberately breach health and safety procedures, but we’ve all made mistakes at one time or another that has led to an incident and this will be no different for Covid-19 protocols. There will also need to be a record of an occurrence as a safety incident – this is particularly important for contact tracing.
SPEAK UP!
Remember, it’s always important to speak up if you see something you know is unsafe on site. In the first instance, and if you’re comfortable doing so, go and have a chat with the person involved. Chances are they didn’t realise what they were doing and will be grateful for a friendly reminder.
If you can’t do this or don’t receive an acceptable response, then you should bring it to the attention of your manager or supervisor, who should then let the main contractor or person in charge of the site (on a residential site, this may be the client) know what’s going on.
If you feel your concerns have not been taken seriously or addressed appropriately, you can stop or refuse to carry out work if you believe that the work is unsafe or would expose you to a serious health and safety risk (in this case, exposure to Covid-19). If you do this, then you should inform your manager immediately and remain available to carry out suitable alternative work.
If the issue can’t be resolved, then any of the parties involved may request WorkSafe to mediate on the issue – see the WorkSafe website for more information: worksafe.govt. nz/managing-health-and-safety/ cessation-of-work
Whether the issue is with your own employer, another contractor on site, or with the main contractor, if it is putting people at serious risk, there are a few options to consider:
Talking with your own employer.
Involving your health and safety representative.
Involving your safety committee.
Talking to your union representative.
Asking your industry association for advice.
Seeking advice from Site Safe.
Cessation of work.
Requesting WorkSafe to intervene.
YOUR RIGHTS
Under the Health and Safety at Work Act, workers have the right to:
Work in a healthy and safe environment.
Speak up about health and safety ideas or concerns.
Be given a chance to have a say.
Ask for a health and safety representative or committee.
Appropriate training before starting work.
Work with safe machinery, vehicles, tools and equipment.
Have access to health and safety information.
Be provided with PPE if appropriate.
Stop or refuse to carry out dangerous work – you must tell your manager as soon as possible if this is the case.
Be provided with toilets and handwashing facilities, clean drinking water, first aid facilities and a place to have a meal break in reasonable comfort and shelter.
Understand what to do in an emergency.
YOUR OBLIGATIONS
Workers are responsible for:
Taking reasonable care of their own health and safety.
Taking reasonable care that what they do doesn’t make others unsafe.
Complying with any reasonable instruction from the PCBU.
Cooperating with any reasonable health and safety policy or procedure of the PCBU.
If you have questions about the Covid-19 protocols and how to apply these on site, you can make use of the ’Ask an Advisor’ form on the Site Safe website, or contact a Site Safe health and safety advisor directly. Site Safe is also offering a new Pandemic Review (audit) service for businesses keen to find out how they’re measuring up to the Covid-19 protocols. For more information, go to www.sitesafe.org.nz
Site Safe is a not-for-profit, membership-based organisation that supports a culture of health and safety in New Zealand construction. For more information go to: www.sitesafe.org.nz

Health and safety is everyone’s responsibility – whether you’re on site for five minutes or five hours
It’s generally accepted that assuming something without asking can lead to issues, and it’s no different onsite. This month Site Safe is looking to clarify subbies’ responsibilities.
Assumption: I’m a subbie and I’m only onsite for a couple of hours, surely I’m not responsible for health and safety and don’t have to do any paperwork?
Reality: Wrong. Even if you’re a subbie who is only onsite for a couple of hours, you still have health and safety responsibilities. From workers through to company directors, safety onsite is now everyone’s responsibility.
Example: Sam is a self-employed floor sander. He often does sanding on residential renovations for his friend Bruce, who is a builder. Although Sam may only be onsite for a few hours or days, he is still a PCBU (person conducting a business or undertaking) and has responsibilities. The extent of his duty will depend on his ability to control the risk he is creating. The more influence and control he has over the risk, the more responsibility he has. Because Sam is usually sharing a site with other crews or workers, he needs to consult with these other businesses to make sure everyone onsite is kept safe and aware of any risk he has created.
Under the recent Health and Safety at Work Act, clients, principals, main contractors and sub-contractors are all PCBUs. Despite the name, a PCBU is not necessarily one person – in most cases a PCBU will be a business entity, such as a company or organisation, but it could also be an individual running their own business, such as a sole trader. A PCBU has the “primary responsibility of care” to ensure the safety of its workers and anyone affected by its work.
PCBUs must (as far as is reasonably practical):
Have a safe site, plant, structures and ways of working.
Make sure plant, structures and substances are used, handled and stored safely.
Provide facilities for the welfare of workers, such as running water and toilets.
Provide the necessary information, training and supervision to protect people from risk.
Monitor health and workplace conditions.
As Sam is self-employed, he is also classed as a “worker” under the Act. This means he also has a responsibility to take reasonable care to ensure the health and safety of himself and others in the workplace.
So, what should I be doing?
Let’s take Sam. He may only be onsite for a day but he still needs to be thinking about what risks there might be and what he can do to manage them. As a minimum, Site Safe suggests that Sam:
Meet with the main contractor before starting work to discuss the job, any risks and what to do in an emergency.
Completes a Site Specific Health and Safety Agreement with the main contractor, a Hazardous Products and Substances Register for his varnishes and stains, and a Site/Job Hazard Risk Register. The Hazardous Products and Substances Register may be the same for most of his jobs and might just need minor changes for each job.
Does a quick Step Back 5×5 to think through the job. A Step Back 5×5 is when you step back five paces from the job and spend five minutes planning.
This is just an example of one scenario – it is important to remember that each job is different and will require a different approach depending on the circumstances.
Not just ticking the boxes
By talking to the main contractor and completing the Agreement, Sam is helping to communicate what he is doing about safety.
By completing the Hazardous Products and Substances Register and Site/Job Hazard Risk Register, he is communicating what the risks of his work might be and how he will manage them onsite.
By completing the right safety documentation, he is not just “ticking the boxes” but taking a systematic approach to managing risks.
Taking these steps reduces the chances of miscommunication and mistakes and, in the event of an accident or injury, it is also evidence that Sam is on top of safety. In a nutshell, the job is not there to create paperwork, the paperwork is there to support the job.
What next?
If you’re wondering what to do about health and safety, then a great place to start is the Site Safe website, where you’ll find a free electronic Site Specific Safety Plan. This document has many of the individual templates that you need to get a basic system in place including:
Hazard register
Task Analysis / Safe Work Method Statement
Emergency Response Plan
Training and Competency Register
Accident/injury register
Hazardous Products and Substances Register
Accident and Incident Investigation Report
Site Safe also offers the Advanced Passport course, designed to help you understand risk management and Site Specific Safety Plans. For more information on this, or to enrol, go to www.sitesafe.org.nz .

The Health and Safety Reform Bill has passed and the new law (the Health and Safety at Work Act) will come into force 4 April 2016
T he Act, which is part of ‘Working Safer: a blueprint for health and safety at work’, reforms New Zealand’s health and safety system following the recommendations of the Independent Taskforce on Workplace Health and Safety.
Working Safer is aimed at reducing New Zealand’s workplace injury and death toll by 25% by 2020. It will require leadership and action from business, workers and government to achieve this goal. The Act’s key emphasis is on everyone in the workplace being responsible for health and safety.
The Act works to focus effort on what matters, based on business risk, control and size. Below are some key themes included in the Act:
It reinforces proportionality – what a business needs to do depends on its level of risk and what it can control.
It shifts the focus from hazard-spotting to managing critical risks – actions that reduce workplace harm rather than trivial hazards.
It introduces the “reasonably practicable” concept – focusing attention on what’s reasonable for a business to do.
It changes the focus from the physical workplace to the conduct of work – what the business actually does and therefore what it can control.
It supports more effective worker engagement and participation – promoting flexibility to suit business size and need.
The Health and Safety at Work Act will replace the Health and Safety in Employment Act 1992. The new law will be supported by regulations.
How to comply
The regulations, created by MBIE and supported by information and guidance from WorkSafe New Zealand, are intended to help businesses (particularly small businesses) understand what they need to do to comply with the general duties of the Act.
The detailed regulations are now available on the Legislation website – http://www.legislation.govt.nz/ .
Guidance is available on the Worksafe website – http://www.business.govt.nz/worksafe/ .
Regulations at a glance
1. Health and Safety at Work (General Risk and Workplace Management) Regulations 2016
Persons conducting a business or undertaking (PCBUs) have duties to ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, that the workplace is without risks to the health and safety of any person.
These regulations outline additional duties on PCBUs related to managing risks, monitoring risks in the workplace, specific duties related to young persons in the workplace and obtaining a police vet for workers at limited child-care centres.
2. Health and Safety at Work (Worker Engagement, Participation and Representation) Regulations 2016
These regulations prescribe matters relating to work groups, health and safety representatives, and health and safety committees to support more effective worker participation. This includes information on who can be a health and safety representative or on a health and safety committee, and training for health and safety representatives.
The regulations also include matters that an inspector may make a decision on if the parties are unable to reach an agreement themselves, and specify the sectors that are high risk for the purposes of worker participation requirements.
3. Health and Safety at Work (Major Hazard Facilities) Regulations 2016
These regulations deal with matters relating to the health and safety of people involved in the operation of major hazard facilities and the local communities near them.
The regulations provide threshold quantities of specified hazardous substances and ways to determine whether a facility is a lower or upper tier major hazard facility, and the duties of operators.
4. Health and Safety at Work (Asbestos) Regulations 2016
These regulations impose additional duties on PCBUs in relation to work involving asbestos. This includes managing asbestos risks, removal of asbestos and licensing of people removing asbestos.
5. Health and Safety at Work (Adventure Activities) Regulations 2016
These regulations deal with the provision of adventure activities. They set out the process for becoming registered as an adventure activity operator and make it an offence for unregistered operators to offer adventure activities to participants.
These regulations revoke and replace the Health and Safety in Employment (Adventure Activities) Regulations 2011. Only minimal changes were made to align terminology and concepts with the new Health and Safety at Work Act 2015, and to add a new offence of offering adventure activities while unregistered.
6. Health and Safety at Work (Mining Operations and Quarrying Operations) Regulations 2016
The regulations prescribe matters concerning health and safety in mining operations, including competency requirements relating to safety-critical roles in mining, quarrying and alluvial mining operations.
These regulations revoke and replace the Health and Safety in Employment (Mining Operations and Quarrying Operations) Regulations 2013. Only minimal changes were made to align terminology and concepts with the new Health and Safety at Work Act 2015, and fix some drafting and minor implementation errors in the 2013 regulations.
7. Health and Safety at Work (Petroleum Exploration and Extraction) Regulations 2016
These regulations deal with matters relating to the health and safety of people involved in the operation of installations for petroleum exploration and extraction.
They revoke and replace the Health and Safety in Employment (Petroleum Exploration and Extraction) Regulations 2013. Only minimal changes were made to align terminology and concepts with the new Health and Safety at Work Act 2015, to use clearer terminology for duty holders and to improve the emergency response duty in relation to onshore non-production installations.
8. Health and Safety at Work (Rates of Funding Levy) Regulations 2016
These regulations prescribe the levy required to be paid by employers and self-employed persons under section 201 of the Health and Safety at Work Act 2015.
They also revoke and replace the Health and Safety in Employment (Rates of Funding Levy) Regulations 1994. Only minimal changes were made to align terminology and concepts with the new Health and Safety at Work Act 2015. No levy rates were changed.
What is still to come?
Regulations specifying infringement offences and fees will be finalised shortly.
The regulations for work involving hazardous substances are currently being consulted on and will be finalised later this year. Submissions were due by 5pm, Friday 26 February 2016.
Regulations to support the power in the new Act for the regulator to grant exemptions from regulatory requirements (clause 228A) will be developed this year.
Phase two regulations will be developed over the next two years.

Health monitoring helps determine whether staff are properly protected from workplace hazards
Sometimes hazards in the workplace cannot be eliminated or isolated, such as dust, chemical fumes, noise or vibration. However, even though employers may not be able to eliminate or isolate hazard, they still have a responsibility to minimise employees’ exposure to risks and to monitor the impact on their health.
The purpose of health monitoring is to determine if the precautions taken to protect staff from workplace hazards are suitable and effective.
Employers can test and monitor the environment and employees’ health to assess particular workplace hazards:
Environmental monitoring involves measuring air or dust sampling, sound levels or other hazardous environmental factors.
Health monitoring involves direct monitoring of an individual’s health indicators such as blood, urine or lung function tests, and hearing tests.
“Although employers cannot always eliminate workplace hazards, they have a responsibility to minimise employees’ exposure to risks and to monitor the impact these hazards may have on their health
Under the Health and Safety Act 1992 employers must:
Provide appropriate, working personal protective equipment (PPE) and ensure it’s being used properly.
Identify exposure and test and measure if an employee’s health is being adversely affected by hazards. It’s important to give employees copies of results from any health monitoring tests.
If an employee refuses health monitoring, you need to decide if they should be removed from the high-risk task or area.
Employers have a legal obligation to educate their employees. It’s important to provide full training and information about potential hazards, as well as to ensure staff:
Know how to correctly use PPE.
Are aware of any health issues that may arise from exposure to harmful substances.
Are assisted in understanding the results of any health monitoring tests.
Engage with key staff to evaluate the effectiveness of your health monitoring policy.
Employee participation will help improve health monitoring as well overall health and safety culture in the workplace.
Include health monitoring in all employment agreements, to help ensure that helth and safety is taken seriously in the workplace.
If health monitoring returns negative results, these should be entered into accident registers and investigated. It is important that hazard controls are reviewed as part of any investigation to try and reduce exposure entirely.
If significant harm occurs, WorkSafe NZ must be notified. It’s also possible an employee will need to be referred to ACC.
It’s important to note the Health and Safety Employment Act 1992 is under review and will be replaced by the Health and Safety at Work Act, scheduled for April 2015. A discussion document outlining proposals for the new act has been released by the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment and is available on its website.

Site Safe gets a number of questions from people in the construction and building sector via their ‘Ask an Advisor’ website page. Under Construction takes a look at one such question that might be relevant to you and your crew this summer.
Question: “As a company, we supply Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) that is fit for the requirements of the role. However, we are being asked by staff if we will supply them with shorts for the summer.
“The people asking are a team based at a port and our cold store/yard team. Both teams are exposed to full-day varying weather conditions (currently the heat) and are in and out of forklifts, so I am concerned that some shorts are ill fitting and will catch when moving around equipment. In the winter months, we supply overalls.”
Site Safe’s advisor says: The choice of clothing fit for the job is a decision for the Person Conducting Business or Undertaking (PCBU). The PCBU must engage workers and involve them in any decisions affecting their health and safety and this includes clothing.
Your question specifically relates to supplying shorts. Note that these are generally considered to be standard clothing, not PPE, so, the PCBU is not obligated to supply them.
You are correct in identifying any risks that might arise. Poorly fitting clothing (with the potential to catch/snag while getting on and off plant) is potentially a risk but this applies to any ill-fitting clothing. The answer is to make sure that clothing provided fits correctly.
Other risks to consider:
Exposure to UV.
Exposure to projectiles or chemicals.
Exposure to sharp or abrasive surfaces.
Exposure to cold temperatures.
So, unless the shorts are being supplied for safety reasons, the PCBU is not obliged to provide them. However, you may decide to provide them and even make them part of a uniform or dress code. Before doing so, consider whether shorts are appropriate for the work activities and environment (based on risk assessment and consultation with workers).
There is more about PPE from WorkSafe here .

Energy Safety, part of WorkSafe New Zealand, has issued a warning about non-compliant and unsafe thermoplastic-sheathed (TPS) cable being supplied and sold in New Zealand
The cable is marked “EESS 150102-0” and comes in a white or yellow-coloured sheathing. Testing has shown that the cable insulation will become brittle and fracture within a few years of installation and carries a significant electric shock and fire risk.
Master Electrician’s chief executive Neville Simpson says that, when made properly, cable insulation could be expected to have a lifespan of 40 to 50 years.
“Our message to industry following this incident is that it highlights how important it is to use reputable suppliers and wholesalers to ensure products are compliant.”
An Energy Safety spokesman said the cable had been identified in nine building sites across Auckland, including an apartment complex under construction, and that they were working with building owners and developers to remedy the situation. The spokesman said that as far as he was aware, “most parties were working to replace the faulty cable”.
Lyon Electrical Ltd, the company identified as the main importer and installer of the cable, was placed into voluntary liquidation on 2 August. Derek Ah Sam and Paul Vlasic of Rodgers Reidy are administering the liquidation.
The first liquidators report indicated that the company could owe creditors as much as $2 million, including $1,163,748 to unsecured creditors.
Companies Office records lists Ben Lyon as the sole shareholder and director of Lyon Electrical Ltd. Any affected parties seeking compensation will likely have to file a creditors claim form. The cut-off date for applications is Friday, 15 September 2017.

Construction workers need to be well rested and mentally alert to do their jobs safely. Fatigue is a potential risk that both employers and employees have a responsibility to manage
In construction, there is a significant need for better fatigue management – an issue which has recently been highlighted in Canterbury. Last year, the Canterbury Rebuild Safety Charter asked 70 companies to complete a self-awareness tool; this indicated the need for better fatigue management.
In response, the Canterbury Rebuild Safety Forum put together a Fatigue Guideline to raise awareness and provide tips and tools for small to medium-sized construction businesses to manage fatigue risk. Employers should develop a policy for managing work schedules, sleep, environmental conditions and emotional wellbeing. Head to www.sitesafe.org.nz/bestpracticeguides for the full guideline.
Fatigue is more than feeling drowsy. In a work setting, it is a state of exhaustion which can be mental, physical or both. Fatigue reduces a worker’s productivity and ability to do their job safely. A number of factors can combine and contribute to fatigue, including:
The mental and physical demands of work.
Work scheduling and planning.
Environmental conditions.
It’s important that a risk assessment is carried out. To determine if fatigue is a potential hazard, it’s vital to recognise a worker’s mood, alertness, sleepiness, task performance and focus. To assess the risk, ask yourself the following questions and record the answers:
Where, which and how many workers (including contractors and subcontractors) are likely to be at risk of becoming fatigued?
How often is fatigue likely to occur?
What degree of harm may result from fatigue?
Are existing control measures against fatigue effective?
What action should be taken to control the risk of fatigue?
How urgent is the control needed?
Once fatigue is identified as a risk, proper management and prevention is the next step. Possible controls include:
Use machinery to assist with tasks.
Rotate job tasks between workers.
Take appropriate rest breaks.
Reduce the need to work overtime.
Ensure there are appropriate resources to carry out the work.
Have suitable rest periods between shifts.
Avoid working during periods of extreme temperature.
Provide shelter and adequate facilities for rest, sleep and meal breaks.
Train and encourage workers, managers and supervisors to recognise signs of fatigue.
Encourage staff to report fatigue-related issues and concerns.
Develop a fatigue policy for your business, which details maximum shift lengths, average weekly hours and travel time. Make sure all workers are aware of your policy; teach them to recognise fatigue and how to report risks and incidents. Encourage workers to:
Turn up fit for work, having done everything possible to get a good sleep and rest.
Let their manager or supervisor know if a task is beyond their skills. Recognise the signs and symptoms of fatigue.
Tell a senior person on site if they start showing signs and symptoms of fatigue.
Make managers and supervisors aware of other workers who may be fatigued.
Report fatigue-related incidents.
Contact your local Site Safe Advisor for help in developing and applying your own fatigue policy and procedure – www.sitesafe.org.nz/advisors
Site Safe is a national not-for-profit membership organisation that promotes, supports and inspires a culture of health and safety in the NZ construction industry.

Cement may be as common as muck, but take it lightly and it can cause serious burns
Fresh concrete is highly alkaline, with a pH of about 12.5. As a comparison, household ammonia is 11.5 and caustic soda is 12.7. This is very bad for skin and often not enough thought is given to the potential harm to people laying it.
There are a number of potential risks:
1. Concrete burns
One of the most dangerous things about concrete, according to construction safety organisation Site Safe, is that people don’t know they are being burned.
That’s because alkaline chemicals damage the nerve endings first, so there can be little initial pain. However, once they do kick in, concrete burn injuries are extremely painful and can take months to heal – some treatments can even require surgical treatment in the form of skin grafts. In extreme cases, the medical complications associated with the burn may lead to amputation or even death.
2. Irritant contact dermatitis
Irritant contact dermatitis is a skin condition caused by the chemicals that make up concrete. Some particles that make up cement are abrasive and can injure the skin. If the skin is not given enough time to recover, irritant dermatitis can develop. This condition is found in many concrete workers.
Symptoms include: Stinging, itching, redness, swelling, cracking, blisters, scaling, fissures, bleeding.
Cuts or wounds heal very slowly and infections are likely.
3. Allergic contact dermatitis
Allergic contact dermatitis is a skin condition caused by an allergic reaction to concrete. Cement-based concrete contains hexavalent chromium, which causes allergies and, in some cases, cancer.
Daily exposure may take years to cause a reaction; but when it does, it is irreversible. Allergic contact dermatitis is a common reason for concrete workers to leave the industry.
Symptoms include: Swelling, redness, oozing, cracking, stinging, itching, blisters, scaling.
To control concrete risks, consider the following easy methods:
1. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
Reduce the risk of skin contact by wearing:
Full-length overalls with long sleeves and trouser legs that won’t let dust or water in.
Waterproof boots.
Waterproof gloves.
Eye protection.
Any clothing that has been contaminated by concrete should be washed and dried before it is used again. Do not allow contaminated clothing to touch skin directly.
2. Hygiene
Dermatitis can occur without skin being in contact with concrete contamination, so it is vital workers wash their hands before visiting the toilet and eating.
The best solution is to provide a large sink – big enough for workers to submerge their forearms in – with warm water, soap and clean towels to get the concrete off. If running water is not an option, the next best alternative is to store clean water in your work vehicle.
Don’t use abrasive cleaning products or alcohol wet wipes as they can damage the skin and increase the risk of injury – a mild soap is best.
3. Health monitoring
Ensure all workers that may be exposed to concrete know what the risks are and what they must do to look after themselves.
It’s recommended you get professionals to conduct regular skin exams and encourage workers to check themselves for signs and symptoms of concrete skin contact dermatitis.
4. Wastewater
Wastewater produced when working with concrete is toxic – it takes many thousands of litres of water to dilute one litre of alkaline back to a safe pH level (pH6-pH7).
Use these four steps to ensure runoff doesn’t pollute waterways, potentially killing fish and plants:
Check the weather and pick a dry day.
Contain the wastewater by making a bunded area.
Capture the wastewater in the bunded area.
Clear the wastewater by pumping it into a container such as a 1,000 litre cube.
5. Emergency action for concrete burns
If there is any suspicion that a concrete burn has occurred, seek help from emergency services.

December 2017

The rules around managing hazardous substances in the workplace are changing. Every year between 600 to 900 people die prematurely from workplace-related disease, including from exposure to hazardous substances – if you use, store or handle hazardous substances, you need to know how to manage the risks associated with them
Around 150,000 workplaces throughout New Zealand use hazardous substances. Common hazardous substances such as commercial cleaning products, paints, adhesives, acids, bases and solvents can cause serious harm when they aren’t used safely.
A substance that has one or more of the following properties is defined as hazardous:
Wet cement can cause burns, if trapped against the skin. Personal protective clothing or equipment such as gloves or boots must not allow wet cement to be held against the skin
Explosiveness.
Flammability.
Ability to accelerate a fire.
Toxic to humans (acute or chronic).
Corrosiveness (to human tissue or metal).
Harmful to the environment (eg, pesticides).
A substance that could develop one or more of the properties listed when exposed to air or water.
From December 1 this year, the regulations around hazardous substances in the workplace will be transferred from the Hazardous Substances and New Organisms Act 1996 and Regulations to the Health and Safety at Work (Hazardous Substances) Regulations.
WorkSafe advises that if you are complying with the current hazardous substances law, then you may not need to change a lot. However, it is a good time for all businesses to review their processes for keeping people safe around hazardous substances.
Key changes
Outlined below are the some of the key changes that are being introduced with the new legislation.
Inventory:
There is a new mandatory requirement to keep an inventory of all hazardous substances used, handled, manufactured or stored in the workplace – including hazardous waste.
Safety Data Sheets:
Safety Data Sheets are a key source of information for managing hazardous substances. You must have a Safety Data Sheet for all hazardous substances in your workplace, regardless of the quantity you hold (some exceptions
apply). If you are a supplier, manufacturer or importer, go to the EPA website to find out more about Safety Data Sheets.
Information, instruction, training and supervision:
The new regulations have specific requirements around providing information, instruction, supervision and training to make sure workers know how to safely use, handle and store hazardous substances.
Emergency preparation:
You should be managing your risks to avoid an emergency, but it’s equally important to plan for one. The regulations set out specific requirements for this – including understanding procedures to deal with emergencies.
Labelling containers of hazardous substances (including hazardous waste):
There are new requirements for making sure that hazardous substance containers in the workplace are labelled, including process vessels, as well as maintaining the labels on hazardous substances supplied to you.
Signs:
These continue to be an important part of hazardous substances management, as they warn other people in the workplace and emergency services that hazardous substances are on site.
Focus on risk assessment and elimination or minimisation:
It is important to manage the risks associated with hazardous substances and to review what you have in place to keep people healthy and safe. Eliminate risks if reasonably practicable and minimise risk where elimination is not possible.
When are the changes happening?
Most requirements under the Health and Safety at Work (Hazardous Substances) Regulations come into force on 1 December.
However, there are some exceptions:
Later start dates for some specific regulations means you have longer to comply.
Rules that allow existing approvals and test certificates issued under the old regulations to continue until they expire.
To confirm these dates, and for more information on the changes, refer to the WorkSafe website ‘Guidance by Industry’ section.
If you deal with hazardous substances, consider enrolling your workers in Site Safe’s Passport Plus – Worker Health course, a four-hour course that covers how hazardous substances, noise and behaviour can have a serious impact on health.

Falls from three metres or less off roofs and ladders account for a large number of the construction sector’s serious harm accidents. Harness systems are an effective way to minimise these falls, but should be used as a last resort
E mployers must take all practicable steps to ensure their workers are safe, and residential building sites account for more injuries in the industry than any other worksite.
It’s important that a full evaluation of the job takes place before beginning work at height. Go through the ‘hierarchy of controls’ (eliminate – isolate – minimise) and work out the best possible option to control the height risk.
The ‘Task Analysis’ worksheet is a planning tool which requires workers to specify the step-by-step activities that will occur and how they can be done as safely as possible. Opt for safe working at height equipment systems, such as scaffolding, edge protection or mobile elevated working platforms.
Harness safety systems should be a last possible option because they are a form of injury minimisation.
Fall Restraint: The preferred harness system
A fall restraint system prevents workers from reaching the edge. Falls are prevented by having the worker restrained through a full-body harness, which is connected to an energy-absorbing lanyard and suitable anchor point. Restraint systems require less training and competency than other harness systems, but restrict a worker’s movement.
Fall Arrest: The last line of defence
A fall arrest harness provides more movement and allows the worker to reach the roof edge. A shock-absorbing lanyard will break any fall and allow the person to either self-rescue or be rescued.
Additionally, consider the ‘swing fall’ effect. Fixed lanyard anchors need to be at least 6m above the ground to eliminate the potential of hitting the ground or objects if a worker does fall.
It’s vital that a rescue plan be put in place before using a fall arrest system. The harness puts pressure on the fallen worker’s circulation, so a quick and efficient rescue is needed.
Work positioning systems
A work positioning system is often used when there is no solid surface to stand on and a worker is suspended at height. A lanyard is attached to both the worker’s harness and their place of work, so that the worker can lean back and have the lanyard support their weight. This system allows its user to have their hands free to focus on the task, such as line-work. A fall arrest system should be used in conjunction with work positioning systems.
Assess your team, your plan and the worksite
Before commencing work with a harness system, ensure that training, anchors, lanyards, harnesses and rescue plan is current, relevant to the specific job, and compliant with standard AS/NZS 1891.4:2009.
Other important factors to consider when selecting the appropriate harness systems are the competence of your workers (a combination of their training, knowledge and experience); and rescue planning, which is based on your site-specific capability.
It’s vital to supervise workers using harness systems until deemed competent. When considering whether a worker is competent or not, think about whether the worker can confidently demonstrate and understand:
How to correctly fit and attach safety harnesses.
The danger of using incompatible hardware (for example, harnesses and lanyards from different systems).
How to inspect, maintain and store the equipment.
How to correctly anchor, install and use the total restraint system.
Always work in teams when using harness safety systems, and implement a rescue plan before starting work. Assign responsibilities to everyone on site, so they know what to do in case of a fallen worker.
Also complete a ‘Notification of Particular Hazardous Work’ with WorkSafe New Zealand when carrying out work above 5m and ensure you notify them 24 hours before starting the job. Remember, these systems are the last option if you cannot use another method of working at height like scaffolding or edge protection.
Site Safe offers a height and harness course, which covers the unit standard 23229 ‘Use a safety harness for personal fall prevention when working at height’ and discusses the use of these height and harness systems and others.
Site Safe’s ‘Site Specific Safety Plan’ includes a ‘Task Analysis’ worksheet and is free to download from sitesafe.org.nz/sssp

Workplace bullying is bad for business and safety – make sure your site takes a stand against it!
Site Safe’s work with the construction sector has identified that some of the main reasons workers knowingly violate safety rules is because of pressure from their boss or their peers to take shortcuts, in most instances to save time. There is a culture that tells them to ‘harden up’ and many workers even say unsafe acts are expected.
Recently released guidance suggests that if a worker is intimidated by someone else on a construction site to carry out an unsafe act repeatedly – it is bullying, something which it highlights as a significant hazard in New Zealand.
Bullying affects people physically and mentally, resulting in increased stress levels, decreased emotional wellbeing, reduced coping strategies and lower work performance. It can reduce productivity and disrupt workplaces through:
Impaired performance.
Increased absence.
Low morale.
More mistakes and accidents.
Loss of company reputation.
Resignations and difficulty recruiting.
Poor customer service and/or product quality.
Under Part 2, Section 6 of the Health and Safety in Employment Act, every employer needs to take all practicable steps to provide and maintain a safe working environment – this should include dealing with bullying by having policies in place. Employers who don’t deal with it also risk breaching the Employment Relations Act 2000, the Human Rights Act 1993 and the Harassment Act 1997.
WorkSafe New Zealand recently released best practice guidelines on how to deal with workplace bullying.
New Zealand does not have laws specific to workplace bullying, but the guidelines are a big step forward in supporting and guiding businesses and individuals in dealing with this prevalent workplace hazard.
The “Preventing and responding to workplace bullying” guidelines offer comprehensive insight into what workplace bullying is, provide advice to employers and employees, define roles and responsibilities for preventing and managing it and uses case studies as examples.
It also encourages and supports people in taking early self-help action before seeking external forms of assistance, such as WorkSafe NZ or the mediation service offered by the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE).
The definition of bullying provided in the guidelines states that it must be repeated, unreasonable, targeted and creating risk to health and safety; a single instance doesn’t count.
The specific and targeted advice for both employees and employers includes:
Advice for employees on how to assess if you are being bullied, how to record instances of bullying behaviour and a range of low-key solutions.
Advice for employers on how to best respond to reports or allegations of bullying and promote a healthy and respectful work environment.
The guidelines are available on WorkSafe NZ’s website, along with several online tools including:
An ‘Am I Being Bullied?’ checklist.
A flowchart of actions for dealing with being bullied.
A calculator tool for employers to assess the cost of bullying.
A workplace assessment tool that measures organisational culture with a view to preventing bullying.
Studies indicate that safe and healthy workers have higher morale and are more productive – they are more likely to help identify and resolve problems, plan ahead and be part of a positive workplace environment. Help to make New Zealand construction sites safe working environments by getting on top of workplace bullying and preventing harm!
The New Zealand Health and Safety in Employment Act 1992 is currently being reviewed. Head to Site Safe’s website for more information: http://www.sitesafe.HSEreformHUB .

The Workplace Safety Discount (WSD) is a 10% ACC discount for small businesses and the self-employed in high-risk sectors such as construction – which is just over 90% of companies in the building sector! The programme is now being extended to include similar-sized businesses in any sector, all of which acts as a timely reminder as to the importance of workplace safety.
Small businesses really feel the impact of a staff member being injured and, like all employers, want their staff to go home safely at the end of the day. By expanding the programme, ACC hopes to encourage more small businesses to improve their workplace safety and reduce work-related injuries. In return, businesses can receive a 10% reduction in their annual Work Levy, which ACC collects to help meet the cost of work-related injuries.
All self-employed people and any business with a total annual payroll of $537,000 or less, or ten or fewer full-time employees, can now apply for a WSD.
To qualify, applicants must successfully complete a self-assessment form, showing they have appropriate experience and current practices in areas such as:
Hazard identification and management.
Incident and accident investigation.
Employee training in health and safety matters.
Emergency management procedures.
Experience in these areas can be gained on the job or through a health and safety training course.
“Small businesses really feel the impact of a staff member being injured and, like all employers, want their staff to go safely at the end of the day.
The assessment framework will help businesses see the sorts of things they can do to improve workplace safety. If ACC can encourage more businesses to develop effective safety practices for their workplace, that will be a great outcome. ACC wants to work with businesses to make New Zealand a safer place to work.
ACC-approved auditors will check applications and some workplaces may be asked to complete a phone or onsite audit to confirm they qualify for the discount.
New Zealand has a comparatively high rate of workplace injuries; injuries can happen in any workplace. Broadening the scope of the WSD programme is a positive step towards addressing this.
The discount applies for three tax years from the date your application and self-assessment is approved, backdated to the beginning of that tax year. As part of the application, you will be required to complete an annual declaration to confirm your trading details.
ACC also offers a ‘Workplace Safety Management Practices’ (WSMP) programme, aimed at medium and larger businesses.

In a crash, unsecured tools can take the situation from bad to worse – so make sure they are secured or separated
Sometimes the biggest threat to people in a head-on crash is the things that are behind them.
A collision in Hamilton in early February between two vans saw Waikato Police warning tradies that unsecured tools and cargo can become painful, if not deadly, missiles in an accident.
In a Facebook statement about the crash, the Police said wood and tools came flying out of the van as it collided with another vehicle that had crossed the centre line.
“Upon impact, the contents of the Toyota Hiace (including tools) have come flying forwards, towards the driver and his passenger.
“If you are a tradie or own a company, this may be an opportunity to consider any improvements that you can make (in case of an emergency).”
The van driver later told The New Zealand Herald that it wasn’t the wood that broke his windscreen, but accepted that some tools had gone rogue. He said four tools – a clamp, a glue gun, hack saw and multi box – flew out the window, but they were the only things that were unsecured in the van.
CREATE A DIVIDE
Site Safe says putting a barrier between people and objects makes good sense, particularly for tradies and construction workers.
The gravitational force (g-force) on people and objects during collisions that occur around the 50km per hour mark is usually around 20-25 times more than normal. So, for a brief instant, even a 1kg water bottle will have the force of 20-25kg as it flies forward – until it hits the dashboard, the windscreen, or the back of someone’s head.
Otaki St. John ambulance officer Trevor Hunter has dealt with several vehicle accidents involving unsecured items including, tragically, two fatal ones. Another one, he says, was much luckier for the occupants. They were in a head-on crash, which saw a large oxy acetylene cylinder fly out from the back of the van, shooting between them and burying itself in the dashboard.
Another first responder from Otago recalls a call-out where a vehicle had rolled. She says it wasn’t the actual rolling that killed a person in the car, it was a combination of a loose tool box, a chainsaw, and other heavy items.
There are several ways to minimise the risk from such things happening. Keeping them secure is one, keeping tools and materials separated from people via a cargo barrier is another. Of the current range of cargo barriers that are available, the range from Australia’s Milford Industries is one of those that meets the NZS 4034 standard for cargo barriers.
Properly fitted barriers, as well as protecting people from fast-moving objects, may also offer extra protection if the vehicle rolls.
Site Safe also recommends that liquids are securely stowed in correct bottle containers and where possible, fuel should be in a separate trailer.
Site Safe is a not-for-profit, membership-based organisation that promotes, inspires and supports a culture of health and safety in New Zealand construction.

Edge protection is an important part of working safely at heights. A lack of edge protection can lead to life-changing injuries for workers and huge fines for businesses that fail to ensure the health and safety of workers
A recent instance of employers failing to ensure safe working conditions occurred in September 2020, when a tradie fell three metres from an unguarded second-floor void. The fall left the builder with a broken spine, and he now requires a wheelchair to move and can no longer work in the industry.
The companies responsible for ensuring edge protection was in place, Chunda Limited and JMK Homes Limited, were fined more than $500,000 between them. Chunda Limited was fined $258,918.92 and ordered to pay reparations of $61,464.20, while JMK Homes Limited was fined $175,000 and ordered to pay reparations of $46,386.20.
According to WorkSafe guidance, preventing falls should be actively managed, so people working at heights are kept safe.
Eliminating the potential of a fall can be achieved through safer design of working environments by installing walkways with handrails or permanent guardrails, or other forms of edge protection.
Not clued up on edge protection ? Here’s some more information from WorkSafe to help you get up to speed.
What is edge protection?
Edge protection helps prevent people, tools and materials from falling. It needs to be used to isolate workers from a fall when the hazard of working at height can’t be eliminated, and comes in three different forms:
A proprietary system bought ‘off the shelf’.
Guardrailing or another physical barrier constructed from materials or components that form a guardrail or a physical barrier.
Scaffolding in the form of temporary edge protection system for working at height.
A proprietary system must be:
Installed by a competent person with suitable training in safe work methods.
Installed according to the manufacturer’s instructions and specifications.
For a pitch less than 25°, it must be rated.
For a pitch greater than 25°, it must be rated and have infill panels to prevent tools and equipment falling from the roof.
Guardrails must be installed by a competent person.
Scaffolding must be installed by a certified scaffolder or competent person, depending on the height of a scaffold. For more information, refer to WorkSafe’s Good Practice Guidelines for Scaffolding . The mid and bottom rail should be installed at 450mm intervals while the top guardrail should be installed 900-1100mm above where the roof line projection intersects the guardrailing.
When is edge protection required?
Edge protection is required on all exposed edges of a roof, including the perimeter of buildings, skylights, openings in the roof and other fragile roof materials. It also applies to openings and edges in floor areas.
According to WorkSafe guidance: “Edge protection is the preferred control for preventing falls from roofs on single-story buildings because it isolates multiple workers from the risk of a fall. If this is not practicable, then the use of scaffolding, mobile elevating work platforms or temporary work platforms are more acceptable alternatives.”
Edge protection may be temporary and erected during the course of construction, or it may be permanent – such as a balustrade preventing a fall from a mezzanine floor.
You need a plan
Employers need to have a plan in place for when edge protection is required, its installation and how to manage risks during installation. Edge protection should be installed as early as possible in the project, so it can be used throughout all stages of the build.
Prior to installation, a task analysis and a hazard analysis should be undertaken to identify hazards and understand which controls can be implemented to prevent harm during the erection process.
“ Construction and installation must take into account the forces that are likely to be applied to the edge protection as a result of the work undertaken,” says WorkSafe. “Do not install it from the roof. Inspect edge protection regularly, especially after a storm or other occurrence that could affect its ability to prevent falls from height.”
It’s important to keep in mind that any work that could result in a 5m or more fall, the work must be notified to WorkSafe.
Part of a broader objective
Installing edge protection is part of a broader objective to keep builders safe while working from heights. There are several ways to isolate or minimise the potential for harm resulting from a fall, of which edge protection is one.
Other controls available are:
Scaffolding.
Mechanical access plant.
Safety mesh.

The new Health and Safety at Work Act comes into force on 4 April and it’s important to make sure you understand how the changes will affect your business
C onstruction is a $30 billion dollar industry that generates about 6% of New Zealand’s economic activity and employs almost 200,000 people.
However, it’s also made up of many small businesses – 87% of construction companies employ fewer than ten people. For many of those businesses, the owner will be the director, chief executive, chief financial officer, site foreman, company secretary and possibly orders the tea every second day.
It’s a hands-on business. Everyone’s busy, everyone gets stuck in. In a way, that should make it easier to keep on top of health and safety. The management and directors – at least in smaller operations – are less likely to be cut off behind a desk at head office. Even if you’re based at the office project-managing, you’re likely to have come up through the trades and have a good understanding of the realities of construction.
That practical knowledge of the job at the management level is invaluable for small and medium construction companies, because when it comes to health and safety, everyone needs to play their part – from the company owner to the casual labourer.
Health and safety is everyone’s business
There needs to be leadership at all levels, which starts at the top with directors and chief executives. Under the new law, they have to do ‘due diligence’ for health and safety in much the same way as they are expected to for financial reporting. After all, directors and chief executives will have huge influence over resourcing, company policy, setting performance targets and a myriad of other things that can affect health and safety.
Directors are not expected to be personally on site ensuring that workplace risks such as working at height and asbestos are properly managed, but they need to ensure that their business is well set-up to handle health and safety. That’s more than just checking that there’s a health and safety policy; they need to know that it’s working and have good reporting systems.
For larger construction firms, that might mean the board sets up a health and safety subcommittee – as recommended by the Financial Markets Authority. Lawyers Chapman Tripp suggest that boards should make health and safety a standing item on their agendas and should consider the health and safety implications of decisions on timeframes, budgets and bonuses.
Health and safety is not something you do once and then file away on a shelf – there needs to be ongoing vigilance.
It’s not just one-way traffic, though – workers also need to take responsibility for acting in a safe and healthy way. This means wearing the right gear (and reminding a mate who isn’t), following proper health and safety processes and taking five to plan how to do a task safely when a situation changes.
Worker engagement – and participation
The new law also introduces a requirement on all businesses to engage with workers on health and safety matters. It doesn’t set in stone what form that engagement must take. That will vary from industry to industry and workplace to workplace. However, the law is clear – if it relates to health and safety then there needs to be meaningful discussion with workers.
As well as asking workers for feedback on specific questions, all businesses need to have clear, well-known ways for workers to raise suggestions or issues on a day-to-day basis. Many construction companies already start the day with a toolbox talk – that’s one simple way to get everyone involved in discussing health and safety, spotting issues and suggesting solutions.
Any business can choose to have a Health and Safety Representative (HSR) or Committee. These are examples of clear ways for workers to raise suggestions and can help the business keep on top of its legal obligations. Larger businesses (with 20 or more workers) and those in high-risk industries, which includes construction, must arrange an HSR election if requested by a worker. In addition, if an HSR or five or more workers ask for a Health and Safety Committee (HSC), then the business must formally consider that request.
Get ready now
While the law is changing, the fundamentals of keeping people safe on a building site are not. The law doesn’t change the way to put up a scaffold or set up an exclusion zone around a crane, but the Act does require businesses to take identifying and managing risks seriously.
To be clear, that doesn’t mean you are expected to eliminate all risks at any cost. That’s not possible, particularly in an industry that involves heavy machinery, power tools and working at height. However, you need to have good processes for identifying risks and putting in place sensible controls.
The trick is to make sure health and safety is integrated into your business at every level. Keeping an eye out for one another should be part of everyone’s daily routine. If it’s not already, now is the time to take action. Not only will you and your workers be safer and healthier, so will your business.

Eyes and hands are generally the first body parts protected when preparing to weld, but there are some other precautions often overlooked that are equally important to workplace safety
There are number of things you need to consider when welding. While wearing eye protection and gloves is a good place to start, we’ve put together the following guide to ensure that you and your colleagues remain safe.
Any bare skin is at risk of thermal burns from sparks and other hot material. Another risk is intense ultra-violet rays, which cause sunburn. Like sunburn, the exposed area increases the likelihood of skin diseases such as dermatitis, cancer and melanoma.
It’s best to wear long-sleeved shirts/overalls with the top button done up. Avoid the urge to carry out ‘tacking’, while just turning your face away from the arc.
We often have to assume static positions for long periods during welding, which can lead to a greater reliance on your heart to push the blood around your body as the ‘static’ muscles are not flexing.
This increases the presence of toxic residues, like lactic acid in muscle tissue, which can cause fatigue and increase the potential for injury. To reduce the chances of this occurring, stretch and take regular breaks throughout the day.
When welding, we are literally right in the thick of it. We can’t see the clouds of fume spiraling away from the arc through the darkened helmet lens. This can make us a little too relaxed about what we could be inhaling. Almost all constituents of the various welding methods can cause serious health effects over time, even death. You can protect yourself in a numbers ways:
Extraction at source – use of mechanical devices that draw the fumes away and filter harmful particulates out, before releasing them into the atmosphere.
Filtered respirator – usually in the form of a silicon half mask, with appropriate filters, or a more specialised welding helmet attached to a belt-mounted battery operated air pump, which pumps filtered air into the helmet. This not only provides cool, filtered air, but also creates a higher-pressure zone inside the helmet, which excludes entry to the fume and smoke.
Disposable masks – these are lightweight, comfortable and, provided the right type is chosen (fume and particulate), they provide a reasonable degree of protection as long as they fit well.
Respirators and masks are most effective when they form a good seal around your face. Bear in mind that the amount of facial hair you have can significantly reduce the filtering ability of your chosen respirator or mask.
As the majority of welding processes use electricity, it is surprising how few people actually carry out a safety check of their plant and equipment before use:
Inspect all leads and equipment before each use.
Have equipment tested and tagged by a competent person.
Use a residual current device (RCD) or Lifeguard.
Have repairs made by a licensed electrical worker.
Replace damaged equipment.
Consider your work area when welding. Have firefighting equipment nearby and use a welding screen to protect those around you from light radiation. Using a fire blanket to protect items around you can prevent accidental ignition caused by sparks.
When you are welding in a confined space, there are additional steps you should take to make your work area safe:
Having a trained and alert observer overseeing the work.
Having a rescue plan in place with entry/exit points sorted.
Consider testing the air with a monitoring device: over time, toxic gasses can deplete oxygen levels to unsafe levels.
Ventilate the area: welding can heat up a confined space, so takes regular breaks and ventilate the area as much as possible.
Check if the job requires a hot work permit from WorkSafe NZ.
The next time you begin your welding project, consider going beyond just eye and hand protection, so that you can go home in the same condition you left in. If you need help with welding safety, start with the free ‘Ask an Advisor’ section on the Site Safe website and we’ll be happy to help.

A business must provide information, training and instructions to protect workers and visitors on a construction site. Inductions are a great way to meet those requirements, but only when done properly
I nductions provide people with the basic knowledge of work health and safety requirements, such as the key risks they need to be aware of onsite and what to do in an emergency.
Anyone who has spent a period of time in the construction industry will know they can range from a handshake at the gate or signing your name at the bottom of a policy, through to spending half a day undertaking offsite training. We’ve put together the following guide to help ensure your inductions are up to scratch.
What information should be provided at a workplace induction?
Workplace inductions vary depending on the type of project and what stage it is at. For example, an induction to a single-storey house site could include a short pre-start meeting or on-the-job training.
For large and complex civil or commercial projects, a more detailed induction is required, including an explanation of the emergency response and evacuation processes. It’s good practice to let new workers and visitors to the site know about the following key points:
Incident, emergency and evacuation procedures.
The layout of the workplace, including entries and exits, location of facilities, first aid and security requirements.
How to report incidents and hazards.
Hazards and risks specific to the workplace.
Control measures for those risks.
Site-specific rules that must be complied with.
Safety documents, policies and plans specific to the workplace.
Task specific training
If the person will be working on the site then you should give them task-specific training. This training provides information to people carrying out a particular job and what hazards, risks and control measures link to that particular task. This training should cover:
Who is in charge and responsible.
Information on the task an individual will be doing.
Hazards, risks and control measures involved in carrying out the task.
If relevant, it is good to show workers the Task Analysis/Safe Work Method Statement. Other documents such as standard operating procedures or work procedures are also a good idea.
Any relevant legal responsibilities, codes of practice or technical standards that need to be followed.
How should an induction be carried out?
The way an induction is presented will depend on various factors, for example the number of people being inducted, the size of the workplace and the complexity of the health and safety matters to be discussed.
The method of delivering a workplace induction is up to the person in charge. It pays to consider any language or cultural barriers before deciding on your induction process. Some ways induction training can be delivered are through:
On-the-job training.
Toolbox talk/pre-start meetings.
Step-by-step checklists.
Induction videos or booklets.
Email or a phone conversation.
Online interactive programmes.
Remember to keep a record
Where possible, a record should be kept of the names of people who have been inducted and trained. This should include the training content, who conducted the training and the date. Make sure the participant acknowledges the training; the best way to do this is to have them sign the training record.
Site Safe has a Site Specific Safety Plan on its website, which has many of the templates referred to in this article. Visit sitesafe.org.nz/sssp to download it for free.

E ighteen months ago, a residential build with full scaffolding stuck out like a sore thumb – now the opposite is true. Health and safety inspectors say that these days, it’s the construction sites without scaffolding that stand out.
While out completing assessments and investigations, inspectors are keeping an eye out for those companies that are leading the way in height safety.
The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) has been capturing these good practice stories, and are publishing case studies such as the one below on its campaign website to demonstrate how height safety is becoming business as usual.
Case study 1 Continuous Spouting: Roofing contractor
Builders aren’t the only workers affected by the push for greater safety when working at height. Tradespeople such as roofers, spouting and fascia installers and painters all work at height on residential builds and many are noticing a change for the better – with improved safety and installation times.
John Cameron, operations manager at Continuous Spouting in Auckland, says the increased use of scaffolding on new builds has made access to the work easier, while saving his workers hours on the job.
“Where scaffolding has beensupplied for our installations, productivity has increased by about 60%,” says John.
“Historically, we use ladders in most cases; with the scaffolding, access to the work areas is made so much easier.”
Continuous Spouting is also in the process of developing a safety policy that addresses work at height.
“Approved access systems such as scaffolds and/or Elevated Work Platforms (EWPs) will be adopted as a preference. This is to ensure we comply with our obligations to provide a safe work environment for our sub-contractors and employees and to increase productivity and efficiency of work.
“The response from our workers has been largely positive. However, there can sometimes be resistance due to having to compete with other companies who do not have the same values in providing safe work environments.”
Case study 2 BJ Carter: builder
BJ Carter is a small construction company that’s taken big steps to improve its health and safety systems. Owner James Carter has invested in a health and safety programme for his staff that has everyone thinking about safety before they get on the job.
The guys at BJ Carter have been erecting parts of the build on the ground and craning them into place, with improved efficiency and safety benefits. James has also invested in scaffolding, which is now used on every job, and he says the decision is paying off.
“We wanted to be leaders in what we’re doing but we’ve actually found out that it’s more efficient,” he says.
“In a lot of cases, we’re saving up to 20% on labour. We’re scaffolding up off the ground from 1500–1800mm, so we can do the fascia and everything off the scaffold. Then the painters are using it while they’re there. It’s saving us days.”
“We’ve also done a couple of projects where we’ve built the floors on the ground and craned them into place, even on residential properties. We built the second storey on the ground and had them craned up, and that was exactly the same – more efficient and it gets the guys off the frames.”
Since the release of th e Best Practice Guidelines for Working at Height , debate has focused on the cost of scaffolding and what it means for businesses. BJ Carter has found that the investment has been offset by productivity gains.
“It’s costing us less than 50% on small, fast jobs. Even on new builds, the scaffolding is saving us about a week in some cases.”
“On a job we did the other day, there was about $3,500 worth of scaffolding used. In theory, that’s only costing us about $1,000.”
This is good news for small business owners concerned with rising costs. Improved health and safety systems have added some costs to BJ Carter, but James says it’s worth it.
“All my guys are saying it’s far more efficient. They feel safe on the roofs and they’re able to work a lot faster.I wouldn’t have believed that until we started using it.”
James has also introduced the ‘take five’ process – actually taking five minutes to think about the job you’re about to do – and has worked with Site Safe to create a health and safety programme that works for his team. James puts the cost of this at around $50-$100 a head (for ten guys) – but it’s paying off at the other end.
“After introducing ‘take five’, the guys are actually thinking about the job before they do it. That’s actually made them more efficient because they’re having to plan out their day.”
There’s heightened awareness of health and safety issues in the industry and the team at BJ Carter is taking it very seriously. This gives James confidence that the market will even out in about six months, with everyone pricing jobs to include scaffolding to create a level playing field.
“I think we’re far more aware of health and safety now than we’ve ever been. It’s the biggest thing affecting the construction industry at the moment.”
“Even though everybody’s saying ‘all it will do is cost more money’, I’m sure it will increase productivity. Everybody’s just starting to think a bit smarter.”

New ‘mixed-model’ skills maintenance scheme is now in effect
C hanges to the LBP skills maintenance scheme, announced earlier this year, come into effect last month and the gradual transition to the new skills maintenance scheme has begun. The new framework moves away from an entirely points-based system in favour of a new ‘mixed-model’ approach, with the aim of promoting more meaningful and relevant learning for LBPs.
The new model will require LBPs to complete both compulsory and elective activities. Compulsory activities include reading LBP Knowledge articles in Codewords, completing a quiz after each article and demonstrating two examples of on-the-job learning.
The elective part of the new scheme remains largely the same. Each hour of relevant elective activity equals 1 LBP point. The only change is that the minimum number of points required has now been reduced by half.
Although the new scheme officially started on 2 November, LBPs are only required to transition to the new system once they renew their licence on or after the change date.
For example, if you are required to submit your next skills maintenance form by 13 May 2016, you will continue to do activities and earn points under the current scheme until then. From 14 May 2016, you will transfer to the new scheme.
Key details on the upcoming changes to the LBP skills maintenance scheme include:
1. Completing both compulsory and elective activities
Completing compulsory and elective activities promotes meaningful and relevant learning, while saving you valuable time and resources in meeting your skills maintenance requirements.
2. You still have two years to complete all activities
Timeframes for meeting your skills maintenance requirements will not change – you still have two years to complete all activities before applying for relicensing.
3. Reading LBP Knowledge articles in Codewords
The articles cover important regulatory and technical information relevant to your licence class. Articles will be delivered directly to your inbox.
4. Complete a quiz after each article
You will need to complete a short quiz following each article, which reinforces the information covered within that article.
5. On-the-job learning is now a compulsory activity
On-the-job learning is an effective and efficient way of capturing how you continue to learn through the course of your work. Over the two-year timeframe, select at least two project examples where you’ve had to learn something new, or you’ve had to complete a more complex job. Evidence can include a copy of a Record of Work (RoW) form, a Certificate of Design Work (CoW form), or any other form which documents what you have done and what you have learned on the job.
6. Elective activities
The elective part of the new scheme remains largely the same. Each hour of relevant elective activity equals 1 LBP point. The only change is that the minimum number of points required has now been reduced by half.
7. The new scheme comes into effect on 2 November 2015
You will transfer to the new scheme once you have completed your skills requirements under the current scheme. For example, if you are required to submit your next skills maintenance form by 13 May 2016, you will continue to do activities and earn points under the current scheme until then. From 14 May 2016, you will transfer to the new scheme.
8. Auditing
Each year, a number of LBPs will have their skills maintenance records audited. Keep up-to-date copies of the skills maintenance activities you have completed by either uploading your records online or keeping a paper copy on file.
9. It’s not all about the points!
The purpose of the new scheme is to promote meaningful learning and encourage LBPs to focus on doing activities that are relevant to their licence class and area of practice. It is designed to focus on key areas of learning, which LBPs can effectively apply to their line of work.

WorkSafe offers insight into what “reasonably practicable” actually means when it comes to health and safety in a small business
S mall to medium-size businesses (SMEs) make up about 97% of businesses in New Zealand and employ one of every three New Zealanders. Since the Health and Safety at Work Act 2015 (HSWA) became law almost two years ago, many of these same businesses have been trying to determine how their liability has changed with regards to health and safety.
Many duties under HSWA apply ‘so far as is reasonably practicable’. It’s an important concept that involves doing what is reasonably able to be done to ensure people’s health and safety under the given circumstances. However, it has given rise to a number of myths.
COMMON MYTHS
Health and safety reps are now compulsory.
Wrong: Only for businesses with 20 or more employees.
I can’t use a ladder at all when working at height.
Wrong: The law doesn’t specify heights at which you should or shouldn’t use a ladder, but it does specify that you must use equipment appropriate to the task. Ladders should be used for low-risk, short-duration tasks, with three points of contact maintained to prevent a person slipping and falling.
If a worker gets even a minor injury, it has to be reported to WorkSafe.
Wrong: Under the new law, you must notify us when certain work-related events occur – these are called notifiable events. A notifiable event is when a person dies, is seriously injured or becomes seriously ill as a result of work.
SO WHAT DOES REASONABLY PRACTICABLE MEAN?
The term ‘reasonably practicable’ appears throughout the Health and Safety at Work Act 2015 (HSWA). ‘Reasonably practicable’ is used to qualify duties to ensure health and safety. There is no such thing as zero risk. It’s important to note that the person conducting a business or undertaking (PCBU) is not expected to guarantee the safety of their workers and others from work activities.
Instead, PCBUs are held to a ‘reasonably practicable’ standard.
It is a judgement call that the PCBU must make. It involves weighing a risk against the resources (time and cost) needed to manage it. Here are a few things to consider:
Reasonably practicable means you don’t have to do everything humanly possible; you do what is suitable in the circumstances to first try to eliminate the risk. If the risk can’t be eliminated, then you minimise it.
Just because something is possible to do, doesn’t mean it is reasonably practicable under the circumstances.
1. Before weighing up if something is reasonably practicable, you should first consider common controls for common risks.
If you follow industry standards or commonly accepted guidelines for carrying out a task (eg, common controls), then the likelihood is that you are already taking suitable actions to ensure health and safety. Where these are available, WorkSafe expects people to follow them under most circumstances.
Example: It is good practice to guard a guillotine to protect the operator from potential cuts or amputations.
This is the reasonably practicable control in most cases. If the guard cannot be used for a specific reason, then suitable actions need to be taken to ensure the operator’s safety while using it.
2. If there is no common control available or you choose not to use it, how do you decide what is reasonably practicable in the circumstances?
If there isn’t a common control for a risk, then you first need to evaluate the risk and the ways to control it. Lastly, you would consider the costs and whether they are proportionate to the risk.
All the relevant elements of the risk and how to manage it must be considered and weighed up, and a balance must be achieved.
On one side, you have the potential risk; on the other, you have the time and cost needed to control it. You need to balance the two sides to achieve a result that provides the highest protection reasonably practicable in the circumstances.
Responses must be proportionate to the risk. To spend $1 million to prevent five staff suffering from paper cuts is obviously grossly disproportionate, but to spend $1 million to prevent a major explosion capable of killing 150 people is obviously proportionate.
If you are not using a common control to manage the risk, then you should think about these factors:
a) How likely is the risk to occur?
The more likely a risk is to occur, the more should be done to eliminate or minimise the risk.
Your response should be proportionate to the risk.
b) How severe is the harm that might result from the risk?
More should be done to eliminate the risk if death or serious injury is a possible or likely result.
The greater the potential harm, the greater the response required.
c) What you know or ought to reasonably know about the risk and the ways of eliminating or minimising it.
You are expected to find out if there are any ways to eliminate or minimise the risk. If you are unsure, you can do so by carrying out a risk assessment, talking to workers, other PCBUs in the industry and health and safety representatives, and looking at health and safety records and processes of others will help inform decisions. The WorkSafe website is also a valuable resource.
d) The availability of the control measures, and how suitable they are for the specific risk.
How a risk is eliminated or minimised will depend on the situation, type of work, work environment etc. This is where you will need to apply judgement to figure out the best actions to take.
e) As a final step, consider if the cost of setting up control measures is grossly disproportionate to the risk.
Note: Cost is rarely an excuse for not setting up a necessary control for a risk. However, below is an example of where it can affect a decision.
Example: It is possible to helicopter scaffolding into a remote inaccessible area of the bush to complete repairs on a small hut. However, it may not be reasonably practicable to do so.
The high cost of the helicopter and flying in certified scaffolders to set up and take down the scaffolding compared to the risk to workers is disproportionate.
Instead reasonably practicable alternatives may be more suitable in the circumstances to control the risk (eg harnesses).

For the safety of everyone on site, ensure you have procedures in place for any emergency that could occur – and that everyone knows what those procedures are and why they’re important.
Most health and safety plans and procedures focus on harm prevention, but it’s just as important to be prepared for an emergency situation such as fires, earthquakes etc.
It’s vital you and your employees know what to do, if an emergency were to happen on site. The Health and Safety in Employment Act (HSE) requires every employer to develop procedures to deal with emergencies. Best practice is to work through those procedures with all employees and contractors.
Everyone on site has a part to play in preventing harm and ensuring each other’s safety.
Employers must develop a plan and make sure it works and has been practised, with everyone understanding their individual roles and responsibilities.
Employees have the responsibility to be familiar with their specific roles and responsibilities, if an emergency was to occur.
Emergency situations are stressful and can heighten anxiety, leaving people confused about what to do next. It is important to have a specific step-by step procedure of what to do in an emergency situation. Consider the following when developing your evacuation and rescue procedures:
1.   Emergency Evacuation Plan
Have your plan visible, up to date and easy to find and read.
Make sure assembly points are easily displayed and well known.
When calling the emergency services, be clear about the site address, travel time, landmarks and any significant hazards on site
“When inducted onto site, workers sould be made aware of the assembly points and what to do in an emergency situation
2. Training
When inducted onto site, workers should be made aware of the assembly points and what to do in an emergency situation.
Run regular and random emergency drills, so that everyone knows their responsibilities.
Run additional training for those who need to perform specific rescue tasks, such as from a fall arrest harness system.
3.   First Aid Kit/Civil Defence Kits
Do you have a first aid kit?
Do you have a civil defence kit?
Are they easy to locate?
Do all vehicles have both kits, so that you can be sure each site will have access to emergency supplies?
4.   First Aid Training
It’s best practice to have everyone on site trained in first aid (especially in case your only first aider gets injured).
Your first aid training should cover:
How to resuscitate and start the heart – CPR.
How to stop major bleeding.
How to treat burns, scalds and shock.
Your documented emergency procedure is a form of communication between the employer and the employees – make it clear and easy to read, so everyone understands what to do.
How will your company know when an emergency situation is happening?
How will you know that everyone is safe, including lone workers?
Are any of your employeesor yourself working alone?
Is there a language barrier with people on site?
Can everyone read and understand your procedures and signs?
Are you working in a remote location?
Are there any unusual features to the site?
Is the wind a potential issue?
The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) has a newservice delivery. To notify MBIE of any serious accidents/incidents and/or significantly hazardous work, contact their central response team on 0800 20 90 20 or email healthsafety.notification@dol.govt.nz.
Have you got a rescue plan in place?
Does everyone know about it?
Has it been practised?
Site Safe’s FREE downloadable Site Specific Safety Plan (SSSP) has a Emergency Evacuation Plan template for you to use, along with other helpful templates and registers.

Heat, dehydration and fatigue. These three things can bite a tradie over summer and are all closely related. Heat can combine with dehydration and lead to fatigue. Managing how you work in the heat and keeping up your fluid intake can avoid these problems
Dave Crowley, from Palmerston North’s Scafit scaffolding company, says dehydration takes the edge off people and he’s seen it with his team.
“Come the afternoon, because we’ve got a really physical job, dehydration can be a real problem, as it leads to fatigue,” says Dave.
“We had a feeling that some of our minor accidents happening later in the day might be a result of dehydration and fatigue due to a lack of food and water intake.”
To counteract this, Scafit supplies plenty of water and encourages its employees to stay away from sugary and caffeinated energy drinks. The company also provides all-day breakfast with quality cereals and toast to look after the team’s nutrition.
“If the guys aren’t eating properly, they’re certainly not thinking properly,” Dave says.
They even put up pee charts in the toilets, so guys can compare what’s coming out with the optimum colour. Too dark means they need to drink more water.
Knowing the danger signs of too much sun and heat are vital says Jeff Strampel, Health and Safety Lead for Site Safe.
If heat stress or exhaustion is not dealt with quickly, it can progress to heat stroke, which can be life-threatening.
But Jeff explains that even everyday fatigue just makes things harder all round.
“It can be tempting to take on too much work, especially if you’ve been waiting for good weather to get started on a job. Just remember to take a step back and think about the task before you get stuck in. Smart planning makes the job safer.”
Be careful when doing these types of work, which make you more likely to suffer heat exhaustion:
Working in the direct sun.
Working near heat-producing processes.
Working in confined spaces.
Doing underfloor, ceiling or roof work.
Sitting in cabs of mobile plant.
Working in closed areas with limited airflow.
Make sure you know the danger signs to look out for when working in the heat. It might be things you notice in other people, as it can be hard to spot the danger signs in yourself.
Symptoms of over-heating:
Clammy or sweaty skin.
Feeling weak or dizzy.
Dark-coloured urine.
Pounding or rapid pulse.
Loss of balance.
Headaches.
Muscle cramps.
Mood changes or confusion.
Then there’s the long-term issue of being exposed to the burning rays of the Kiwi sun.
“Unfortunately, New Zealand has one of the highest melanoma rates in the world,” Jeff says. “Kiwis need to know that exposure to our harsh UV rays can lead to melanoma or other skin cancers.”
Workers who are new to New Zealand may not realise how strong the New Zealand sun is, so it’s important to reiterate it to new employees.
Tips for staying safe
Be the person with the plan: if you have several jobs to do outside, think about where the sun is and which jobs you might be able to do first to avoid full sun for too long.
Be cool: wear lightweight, breathable clothing if it’s safe to do so, but be sure to comply with your company’s clothing and PPE regulations. Remember to wear a hat, safety sunglasses and good quality sunblock. With any sunglasses, always check the impact and UV rating.
Don’t sweat it: stay hydrated with lots of water. Avoid dehydrating drinks containing caffeine or alcohol. People need about eight glasses of water per day, but if you’re working in the heat, it’s  likely you will need more.
Go with the flow: think about airflow and use fans to provide ventilation and keep the temperature down if necessary.
Take a break: if possible, consider taking a break and heading inside during the hottest part of the day. Have regular breaks and consider extra breaks if the work is demanding. Monitor and place limits around overtime and avoid incentives to work too many hours. If you need to work longer hours, consider staggered start and finish times, and longer breaks and periods off  work. Try to set realistic deadlines and timeframes for jobs.

Clearly written health and safety plans can have multiple advantages for your business and are a practical way of proving you have effective methods to identify and control hazards
Proper planning can help you identify better ways to complete tasks, reveal other smart ideas for your workplace and provide evidence you are fulfilling your legal obligations, as required by Section 7 of the Health and Safety in Employment Act.
Before starting a construction task, put together a health and safety job plan. The following tools will help. They can be found in the Site Specific Safety Plan, which is free to download from www.sitesafe.org.nz/SSSP .
Identify:
What’s really dangerous?
What’s something that could really happen because of the work you’re doing?
Assess:
Think about each hazard and ask: Is it significant? What’s the likelihood of it happening?
Control:
How is your business going to make sure that the people in and around your workplace stay safe from the hazards you’ve identified?
Have you thought about the basics – personal protective equipment (PPE), signage and plant needed?
Are the controls you’ve considered the best approach?
Could you remove the hazard completely by doing the task differently?
The ‘task analysis’ is used when the hazard is assessed as ‘significant’. The significant hazard presents a degree of risk and needs a formal approach to deal with it. Make sure you check that everything is written down, easy to understand and up to date.

Safety is about more than just ticking off tasks on a checklist – it’s about developing a culture that should become engrained into a business and seen as vitally important, rather than a trivial afterthought.
Creating a health and safety culture takes leadership, accountability and commitment, so how can you forge that path in your own business ?
Culture plays a huge part in determining behaviour and those ‘unwritten rules’. Therefore, a real change in culture must start at the top; leaders send signals to their employees about what is important and worth doing. Leaders should communicate health and safety  responsibilities and expectations clearly, monitor performance, provide constructive feedback and look for ways to improve.
To clearly outline what is expected on site, define accountabilities and specific responsibilities for employees. A responsibility is an ‘action to perform’ and accountability is to ensure those responsibilities are met. Key Point Indicators (KPIs) are a tool used to outline and measure employee accountabilities – eg, the number of toolbox meetings a week, compulsory pre-start meetings and near-misses/incidents reported in a week. To create a more positive approach to health and safety, try to set ‘lead indicators’ (proactive/positive indicators) instead of solely relying on lost-time injuries (LTIs) or the number of accidents.
Managing accountabilities is successful when the process is well communicated and monitored, and employees are provided with feedback and recognition.
If responsibilities are not written down, discussed and agreed upon, there is no accountability. Responsibilities can be outlined in job descriptions, health and safety policy statements, emergency plans, task analyses, or the notice board. It’s important to make expectations clear and encourage involvement with your employees.
It is best practice to check that goals are met through consistent monitoring of registers, audits, controls and employee participation. This will provide data to give valuable feedback and make changes where needed.
People respond best when recognised for their performance and actions, as it provides job satisfaction; remember to give positive comments and reinforcement. People also respond well to incentives. Try to reward and recognise safe behaviour at toolbox meetings by letter/email, lunch shouts, preferred contractor lists, references and post-contract evaluations, or a simple pat on the back. Also try the 4:1 approach – give four positives to one potential area of improvement.
For a safety culture to change and be successful, it needs to be strategic and well planned. Effective leadership is more about managing processes and people, rather than announcing a goal. Start with defining and managing accountabilities and responsibilities, provide feedback and recognition, and then commit to it.

If you’re an employer, it’s up to you to ensure your workers have the right personal protective equipment (PPE) for the job, and to provide it for them if they don’t
The Health and Safety at Work (General Risk and Workplace Management) Regulations 2016 state that an employer/person conducting a business or an undertaking (PCBU) carrying out work at a workplace must ensure that:
They or another PCBU has provided workers with the PPE appropriate for the job.
They ensure, as far as is reasonably practicable, that workers use or wear the PPE provided.
The following example from the guidance illustrates those duties:
“To prevent eye injuries, the PCBU of a welding workshop provided its welders safety glasses to wear under their welding helmets. However, even after being instructed by the PCBU to always wear the safety glasses while welding, one worker regularly removed them.
“As the PCBU must ensure workers wear PPE so far as is reasonably practicable, the PCBU talked to the worker to find out why the worker removed their safety glasses. The worker told the PCBU that it was because wearing the safety glasses over their prescription glasses caused discomfort. The PCBU then worked with the worker to find safety glasses that he could wear without discomfort.”
What you need to know
The PPE provided by employers must be compatible with any other safety equipment or clothing required for the job, fit correctly and comfortably, and be suitable for the nature of the work.
Employers also have a duty to ensure that workers’ PPE is maintained properly and replaced when necessary. Proper training on use and maintenance should also be provided to workers.
On the other side of the equation, workers are responsible for ensuring they use PPE in line with the information and training given to them by the PCBU.
They also must not intentionally damage safety equipment, and they must tell the PCBU when PPE needs to be cleaned, decontaminated or has been damaged.
Exceptions
The only exception to the provision to providing workers with PPE is when the worker ‘genuinely and voluntarily chooses to provide their own’. In these cases, the PCBU must be satisfied the gear is appropriate and meets all necessary regulations.
It is important to note that workers may change their minds about this at any time; however, they must give appropriate notice if they wish the PCBU to begin supplying their PPE.
Tips
Remember that PPE must only be used as a risk control once other methods to eliminate or minimise risks have been considered. Normally PPE is used to support other methods of risk control rather than as a standalone means of protection. For instance, a dust mask would be worn when cutting cement board on site; however, the primary means of control may be the use of an extractor to remove the dust.
What PPE do I need to provide?
The type of PPE you need to provide as an employer/PCBU will depend on the nature of the tasks the workers will be doing and the risks they will be exposed to. In addition, PPE requirements on site will usually be set by the main contractor or project manager. For some guidelines about what is recommended, check out Site Safe’s PPE factsheet at https://www.sitesafe.org.nz/globalassets/guides-and-resources/ppe_2017.pdf

A new pocket guide suggests how to have conversations about mental health
Got a mate who’s looking down, isn’t themselves, maybe gone a bit quiet? Want to help but aren’t sure how?
A new pocket guide about how to have conversations about mental health has great advice on looking after friends and colleagues.
“It’s easy to lend an ear, listen, and have a conversation with someone,” says Paul Lynch, a guy who knows what it’s like to do it tough.
The carpet and vinyl installer from Christchurch lost his brother Brett to suicide in 2013. It took him a while to shake off the resulting anger and darkness that he felt, but he did, and wrote the book Suicide; Aftermath & Beyond about it. He has made it his mission to help people in the trades talk about things that are getting them down, and he says the new guide provides advice on how to do so.
Paul says people don’t have to be a counsellor or a therapist to help, they just have to take time to listen.
“In my experience about 99 times out of a hundred, all that’s required is a conversation. It’s that simple act of letting people talk or share something they might be going through.
“Just listen, let them speak, and validate what they’re saying. It doesn’t have to be a crisis intervention.” (Though there are emergency numbers provided in the pocket guide if the situation requires higher intervention).
“I know myself that once you’ve unburdened yourself of something that’s been troubling you, a lot of the pressure goes away with the words.”
The free pocket guide has been created by Dr Kate Bryson of Axon Consulting, one of the key researchers who worked on Site Safe’s study into suicide in the construction sector last year, in consultation with industry people.
Site Safe is pleased to be able to offer the guide in conjunction with Construction Health and Safety NZ (CHASNZ), the Mental Health Foundation and Mates in Construction.
The guide is free for download or ordering on the Site Safe website.
The key messages in it are:
Be approachable – don’t judge and don’t try to have all the answers.
Be empathetic – try and put yourself in their shoes, or boots.
Be willing to listen – give them your full attention and let them know it is confidential between you and them.
Breaking the ice
Auckland electrical contractor Dave Burt uses a question to break the ice with people, which is one of the suggested phrases in the guide: “What’s happening in your world?”
It’s an open-ended question he came up with after dealing with depression himself. It’s detailed in his book Lengthening the Shadows. It can be a dark topic but, according to reviews, the book is a moving, funny account about  a guy who struggled on by himself for too long.
One of the three winners of the Kalmar Mental Health and Wellbeing Award last year, along with Paul Lynch and the team from building company, The Switched On Group, Dave put money from his book towards the pocket  guide and he says it is full of good advice.
Kristal McGill from The Switched On Group also says the pocket guide is a top resource and they will use it as the firm rolls out its own initiatives this year. Currently it is focusing on how alcohol can affect people at work and  home and how to reach out to services if they, or someone close, may be struggling with addiction issues.
The company is also about to run workgroups with managers and supervisors to help them spot people who are distressed – including how to keep an eye on themselves – and is giving them the resources to help support their people.
“This will build on training provided during 2019 and will take all people leaders through our best-practice approach, our resources and our support for both the manager and individuals involved,” Kristal says.
Just listen
Paul says one of the issues people worry about in dealing with mental health is that they don’t feel they’re qualified to help.
“The truth is, you don’t need to know anything about it, you just need to be a decent enough person to allow somebody to speak and to get whatever’s on their mind, off their mind.”
He says that’s where the pocket guide helps.
“I’ve always said, it’s not like we don’t care or want to check up on our mates, it’s just we often don’t know how to. We need to change that.”
Dave agrees, and he says helping someone is actually pretty easy.
“You may not be aware, but every one of us possesses a very powerful gift. You may not know that you have this gift, but trust me, you do – it is the power to give and provide hope.
“Having experienced depression, I can tell you hope is something I will never take for granted again. For those dealing with a mental health issue, hope is all powerful.
“Think of someone in your life who means a lot to you, be it a family member, colleague or maybe a mate,” Dave says.
“Take the time to connect and ask them what is going on in their world. You might just be surprised by what you hear, and what a difference you can make in someone else’s life.”

S uitable and sensible protective clothing is a pre-requisite for site safety, as it can provide effective protection against a wide range of hazards. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) makes workers more visible and protects them from cuts, falling debris, noise and other site hazards.
Legally, it’s the employer’s responsibility to provide appropriate PPE to their employees and to make sure it’s worn. Knowing the suitable PPE for a job and how to engage your staff to wear it will help protect your employees from harm and meet your legal requirements of taking all practicable steps to ensure safety on site.
It’s important to consider that each task has specific PPE requirements associated with it and that PPE selection also depends on the ever-changing construction environment.
There are some basics that should be considered and implemented on site:
A ‘must’ on site, especially around moving plant. Stay away from chevron tops, as they are specifically for the forestry industry. Make sure your high-vis garments meet the New Zealand standards, in particular AS/NZS4602:1999 .
Steel-capped boots are another ‘must’ on site. The nature of a construction site produces debris and falling objects, so covering your feet is a priority.
P rotects against falling objects and UV exposure. Hard hats are a ‘must’ and can incorporate face shields, respirators, hearing protection and work lights. Make sure your hard hat can be easily seen from afar, has a chin strap and is stored in a cool, dry place. Paint and stickers will weaken the shell and also hide signs of deterioration.
PPE is determined by environment, task and tool; however, some other PPE you could also consider making mandatory are:
Compressors, concrete mixers, circular saws or tools that require you to shout to be heard warrant ear protection.
It only takes a small fragment or splinter to cause irreparable eye damage. Prescription eye protection is essential for those with impaired eye sight. Always wear these when compressed air, hazardous substances, cartridge fired tools, power tools, power washers or hand tools are in use.
When purchasing personal protective equipment from your safety store, be sure to discuss what activities you will be doing, so that you can be sure you are wearing the most appropriate gear. For example, when handling chemicals, Nitrile-coated gear provides excellent chemical protection and compound resistance but will not meet all of your chemical protection needs. Be sure to consult the product’s material safety data sheet and the relevant legislative guidance.
Even for short jobs. Be prepared to swap or add clothing as required for specific tasks. Over time, PPE can become worn/damaged, so it’s important to monitor and keep on top of it and replace if necessary.
PPE is important on site, so why do we see workers not wearing it? Some possible reasons are:
Availability/cost – employers not providing PPE.
Maintenance of PPE – no one wants to wear dirty or broken gear.
Forgetfulness – PPE use is not monitored or encouraged.
Wearing safety gear should be ‘common sense’, but defining what ‘common sense’ is and having safety at the forefront of people’s minds can be difficult.
Consider using Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE)’s ‘Four E’s’ – Educate, Enable, Engage and Enforce – to encourage employees to use safety gear and clothing. The first three are about giving employees the opportunity to participate in health and safety decisions. This also gives you an opportunity to develop relationships and show staff you care about their health and safety.
Educate – Explain to your employees the effects of the different hazards on site and how PPE can protect you. Toolbox talks are a very helpful way of educating your staff.
Enable – It is an employer’s responsibility to provide PPE, so make sure it fits well and is appropriate for the task at hand.
Engage – Talk to your staff. Why are they not wearing their PPE? Give employees a chance to express their viewpoint and see what can be changed to get them to wear their PPE. And remember, are you wearing yours?
Enforce – Finally, if all else fails, explain that the law requires you to provide gear that protects employees against hazards that can’t be controlled in any other way.

Make sure you’re aware of your health and safety responsibilities as a ‘principal’.
The Health and Safety Act 1992 requires principals to take ‘all practicable steps’ to ensure the health and safety of all (sub) contractors and their employees, who carry out work of any kind during an entire project.
A principal is anyone who employs someone to do paid work using a contract.
While your client has a responsibility as a ‘principal,’ several people can be ‘principals’ at any one time. Remember, you may wear more than one ‘hat’ at any particular stage of a project. (see Chart 1)
“While your client has a responsibility as a ‘principal’ several people can be ‘principals’ at any one time.
One practicable step a principal can take to ensure safety on site is to pre-qualify all (sub) contractors, by having them prove their work can be carried out safely and competently.
Pre-qualify (sub) contractors’ health and safety management systems before selecting and negotiating a contract. Ensure they’ve made health and safety a priority and are capable of carrying out the work in that manner.
Principals should request the following from a (sub) contractor:
A fully developed site-specific health and safety plan.
Evidence of competency, such as a training matrix or register.
Evidence of on-site activity, such as site meetings and procedures.
Arrangements for discussing health and safety matters with people on site, such as scheduled toolbox safety meetings.
Evidence of incident and accident reporting and investigation.
Ways to monitor health and safety performance, such as reports, audits and inspections.
Ways to share information from the client or designer/adviser with other contractors and employees, such as activity reports.
Ways to control visitor access, including such things as delivery of materials.
Health and safety plans of (sub) contractors should be monitored by their principal until the project is completed.
One way the construction industry is pre-qualifying (sub) contractors is through AppCon. This database provides (sub) contractors with a health and safety questionnaire to complete and support with evidence. The questionnaire is assessed and graded by a health and safety professional. Principals can view (sub) contractors’ health and safety grading before engaging them for work. For more information about AppCon, head to www.sitesafe.org.nz/appcon . To register onto AppCon, head to www.appcon.co.nz .
Chat with your Site Safe health and safety adviser for further advice about pre-qualifying contractors and assistance in pulling together your own paperwork before a tender.
” Pre-qualify (sub) contractors’ health and safety management systems before selecting and negotiating a contract
The Health and Safety Act 1992 is currently being reviewed. According to the Government’s Draft Health and Safety Reform Bill, the contractual process/chain will continue; however, responsibilities and duties will become clearer and obligations cannot be contracted away.
The proposed Bill discusses a new term called ‘Persons Conducting Business or Undertaking’ (PCBU). The PCBU concept ensures that the duties lie with those people in the best possible position to control risks to health and safety and that those duties are appropriate to their role in the workplace.
Visit www.mbie.govt.nz/what-we-do/workplace-health-and-safety-reform for more information, or head to Site Safe’s ‘The Hub: NZ Workplace Health and Safety Reform’ page under the ‘Information & Tool’ tab.

The start of the year is a great time to take a fresh look at the risks you may be facing on site. Our workplaces are always changing, so it’s vital to constantly reassess your hazards, the level of risk, and the controls you have in place
It is inevitable that tools, equipment and parts will age and with that comes increased likelihood for things to fail. Another thing worth monitoring is your team. Exhaustion, incorrect training or poor supervision can increase risk and the potential for accidents on site. Site Safe has come up with a helpful list of questions to ask yourself before starting back at work.
Do you have the right tools today?
There is always the urge to just get in and get the job done. However, this means we can fall into the trap of improvising with a tool that is not cut out for the job. Pre-start inspections are critical in identifying that the chosen tool is fit for purpose, meets ASNZ standards, and is in good working order. Tagging and testing is essential, and always remember to use a residual current device (RCD).
Has the environment changed?
Can you identify any environmental changes that occurred over the holidays? Where a hazard cannot be eliminated, it must be monitored. Ask yourself — did it rain overnight? This may mean that the ground is now slippery. Could the rain have gotten into any electrical equipment? Could items have moved since you were last there causing new hazards to be present? Are trenches or underground services free from water?
Consider all possibilities.
Sometimes you may be the biggest risk at work. Consider the things that are going on in your life. Did you get enough sleep? Have you had enough to eat? Did you have too much to drink last night? Factors like these could easily take your head out of the game and cause problems. You must always look after yourself and others when on the job. If you’re not fit to work, don’t force it. It’s not worth the risk.
Is your work area safe?
Work areas can easily become a dumping ground for rubbish and tools. Proper housekeeping can help you keep on top of this making the work area safer. Slips, trips and falls on site contribute to a lot of serious harm injuries. Plus, keeping things tidy makes it easier to find things.
Have you been trained?
In many cases workers might have been trained, and, on paper, are qualified to carry out a task. The problem is that sometimes training can be in the form of a demonstration. We all learn in different ways and when it comes to training with tools, ‘hands-on with supervision until deemed competent’ is often the best method.
Is there someone new on site?
Inducting people is an important step when anyone visits your site. Employees, inspectors, potential buyers and management must all be made aware of the site-specific hazards and PPE required.

As an employer, it’s your legal responsibility to provide staff and contractors with a safe workplace. Do you have a fully functioning health and safety system in your business?
Systematically identifying and managing hazards, investigating incidents and accidents and providing staff with appropriate training and supervision are the keys to building a functioning health and safety system. It is equally important that your employees and subcontractors understand their responsibilities. Here are some useful steps to help you improve your health and safety systems:
Ensure the hazard board is visible and close to the site entrance.
Review the hazard board every two days, to ensure it contains the main site hazards and controls.
Document your ongoing hazard information in a hazard register.
Encourage employees to report near misses and incidents.
When accidents occur, ask open-ended questions to find the root cause.
Studying near misses and accidents will help identify trends and unknown hazards.
Does your emergency plan cover all potential scenarios?
Have you developed a plan for each potential emergency situation?
Does everyone on site know what to do?
It’s important that all ‘what-ifs’ are covered, and everyone knows their responsibilities. Make sure emergency response practices are run on a regular basis to check processes work properly.
Your training register should clearly communicate when and where an employee is competent. You should provide your employees with the opportunity to be involved in health and safety processes with toolbox talks and pre-start meetings – you should discuss past accidents, incidents and near misses that have happened on site with your staff. Plan upcoming tasks and ask your staff to voice their health and safety concerns.
Your legal responsibility extends to any subcontractors in your employment.
Employee engagement: Provide opportunities for employees to be involved in health and safety. Toolbox Talk Safety Meetings and pre-start meetings are opportunities to have conversations about preventing harm onsite. Discuss past accidents, incidents and near misses that have happened on site, as well as upcoming tasks and their job safety analysis. Make sure you encourage your staff to voice their health and safety concerns and remind employees that they also have a responsibility for their own safety. Record the minutes of these meetings and save them somewhere safe.
Contractor Management: An employer’s legal responsibility doesn’t stop at their employees, but also includes all their subcontractors. The contractor management policy should include all subcontractors in site inductions and emergency procedures, and require them to develop a site-specific safety plan at tendering stage. It’s also worthwhile to remind your subcontractors that they also have a responsibility for their own safety. Subcontractors should be included in any site inductions and emergency procedures.

Whether travelling to a remote area or being the only one onsite, working by yourself presents some unique risks. The Health and Safety at Work Act has identified working in isolated or remote situations as a hazard that must be managed
A lone worker is someone who is isolated from help, either due to location, time or the nature of their work. This could be someone who:
Drives through or works in geographical isolation and/or difficult areas to access, such as mountain terrain.
Drives through or works in an area not likely to be accessed by others, such as remote rural areas.
Drives through or works in an area where communications are difficult, such as telecommunication black spots.
Works a sole charge shift.
Important questions for a lone worker:
If you or one of your workers were alone and injured onsite and couldn’t use a cell phone, how would anyone else know?
Would anybody raise the alarm if you or one of your workers was in a car crash on the way to a rural site?
How would you get in touch with your work or workers if there was a natural disaster?
What are the risks of working alone?
Lone workers face a variety of risks depending on the nature of each job. But some common risks may include:
Safety: working alone means no one else may be around to help if there is an accident.
Security or confrontation: working alone may put you or your workers at increased risk from other people that you interact with, such as clients or strangers.
Social, technological or organisational isolation: you or your workers might feel cut off from opportunities, information, interaction and events.
What the law says:
The new Health and Safety at Work General Risk and Workplace Management Regulations specifically require PCBUs (a person/entity conducting a business or undertaking) to manage any risks to the health and safety of their lone workers. If eliminating a risk is not possible, they must be minimised, as far as is reasonably practical.
Because each work situation is different, PCBUs may need to consider the risks to lone workers on a case-by-case basis, unless there are specific codes of practice or industry guidelines already in place.
Under the new rules, PCBUs must also have an effective way of communicating with their lone workers.
How to stay safe as a lone worker
Some steps you and your workers could consider:
Design a plan for how to get help quickly in an emergency.
Draw up a plan of what risks you or your workers might face as a lone worker and discuss how these can be eliminated or minimised. You may wish to consider setting up a policy for this.
Set up a plan for what to do when communication is lost in a natural disaster or when you or your workers are in a cell phone blackspot.
Ensure emergency contact details are up to date.
Consider getting a first aid certificate and carrying a first aid kit in vehicles.
If a lot of travelling or driving is required, discuss the steps that can be taken to prevent fatigue. You can download a free guide to preventing fatigue at www.sitesafe.org.nz.
Set up a system of regular, scheduled contact with another person or supervisor.
Make sure everyone has access to the same technology, information, training, consultation and development. Managers should try to invite lone workers to work-related and social events whenever possible.
As part of its Site Specific Safety Planning course, Site Safe offers training on how to manage workplace risks. To talk to an expert health and safety advisor about protecting lone workers, or setting up a health and safety policy, go to www.sitesafe.org.nz.

Large-scale accidents and natural disasters can occur at any moment – on busy construction sites, the potential for damage is greatly magnified. How prepared are you for an emergency?
W e seem to take it for granted that should an emergency happen, we will be able to return home straight away. This isn’t always the case.
We’ve put together a brief guide of things you should consider when preparing an emergency response plan.
Earthquakes and fires
In the event of an earthquake or fire, remember to:
Learn how to isolate the gas, power and water supplies at your worksite.
Identify your evacuation point and ensure it’s in a safe place in the event, away from obvious fire or earthquake hazards.
Have emergency procedures in place and make sure the whole team is aware of them. You can cover this off at your toolbox/prestart meetings.
Additionally, in the event of an earthquake, remember to drop, cover and hold, and also make sure you have provisions available in case you are stuck at work for a number of days.
If a fire occurs, immediately dial 111. When it comes to a major fire, the best idea is to evacuate, not try to fight the fire.
Incorrect use of fire extinguishers can also spread and increase the size of the fire.
Chemical/Environmental emergency (such as a diesel spill)
Make sure you know what hazardous chemicals/substances are present at your worksite, and:
Learn how to isolate the gas, power and water supplies.
Have a storage container/bund wall capable of containing the breach.
Store appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), which is available for everyone on site.
Make sure everyone is trained in the safe control of the chemicals you have on site and any emergency procedures associated with their use.
Have local council and emergency services contact numbers ready.
Medical emergency
Have trained first aiders and first aid kits on site.
Be aware if anyone on site has a particular medical condition you should know about.
If an ambulance is required, call 111.
For all emergencies
Make sure you get to know your team – they could have individual skills and knowledge that could be useful in an emergency. Also, make sure that you:
Induct all your team members, so they know what to do in case of an emergency.
Identify key contacts.
Know where alternative exits are.
Know your head count – how many of your team are on site and need to be accounted for at the evacuation point. Also check the sign in register to make sure visitors are safe. The key to effective emergency management is to be prepared!

Have you been getting consents for low-risk jobs that don’t require them? MBIE reminds builders to use the expanded list of Schedule 1 exemptions where possible
P assed in November 2013, the Building Amendment Act 2013 expanded the range of work not requiring a building consent. However, despite the list of minor low-risk jobs expanding twice in the past two years, the Rules Reduction Taskforce recently found that it’s often misunderstood and underused.
To ensure Under Construction readers understand what’s included, we’ve included a reminder for this month’s article.
Schedule 1
Schedule 1 was amended with the intent of making exemptions easier to use. A new section (section 42A of the Building Act) was added to the Building Act to clarify:
What type of building work is exempt from requiring a building consent.
Who can carry it out.
What other conditions apply.
The scope of building work covered by Schedule 1 doesn’t vary greatly from the previous version (which was amended in December 2010). However, it has a new numbering system and has been divided into three parts depending on who can carry out the building work.
Exempt building work is listed in Schedule 1 of the Act, which has been split into three parts to make it easier to navigate.
The first part lists exempt building work with no limitations on who designs or carries out the work.
The second part deals with exempt sanitary plumbing and drainlaying, which must be carried out by people authorised under the Plumbers, Gasfitters and Drainlayers Act, with some exceptions.
The third part covers building work which has been designed or reviewed by a chartered professional engineer.
Exempt – not easy
Part 1 Exempted building work lists work that anyone can carry out. However, just because building work is exempt doesn’t mean the work doesn’t require skill, it just means it doesn’t require a consent, which should speed things up for the homeowner. Also, exempt building work is not restricted building work, so it doesn’t trigger the LBP requirement. However, many homeowners may choose to employ an LBP as exempt work, such as designing a 1.5m-high deck with fancy balustrades or building a 2.99m-high retaining wall, is still relatively complex.
What’s included?
Below are the general headings in Schedule 1’s list of exempt work. If you’re doing any work in the areas listed below, check the full guidance to see if it is exempt or not. Some of it is tricky to decipher so, if you’re unsure, it’s important to get advice from someone with the appropriate building knowledge and expertise, such as your local council.
General
General repair, maintenance, and replacement
Territorial and regional authority discretionary exemptions
Single-storey detached buildings not exceeding 10 square metres in floor area
Unoccupied detached buildings
Tents, marquees, and similar lightweight structures
Pergolas
Repair or replacement of outbuilding
Existing buildings: additions and alterations
Windows and exterior doorways in existing dwellings and outbuildings
Alteration to existing entrance or internal doorway to facilitate access for persons with disabilities
Interior alterations to existing non-residential building
Internal walls and doorways in existing building
Internal linings and finishes in existing dwelling
Thermal insulation
Penetrations
Closing in existing veranda or patio
Awnings
Porches and verandas
Carports
Shade sails
Other structures
Retaining walls
Fences and hoardings
Dams(excluding large dams)
Tanks and pools (excluding swimming pools)
Decks, platforms, bridges, boardwalks, etc
Signs
Height-restriction gantries
Temporary storage stacks
Private household playground equipment Network utility operators or other similar organisations
Certain structures owned or controlled by network utility operators or other similar organisations
Demolition
Demolition of detached building
Removal of building element
NOTE: All building work, whether exempted or consented, must comply with the Building Code

T his sixth article in a series based on weathertight remediation workshops run by the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) – Building and Housing Group focuses on health and safety.
Due to the nature of remediation work, some hazards are elevated from those encountered on ‘regular’ projects, including those that might not be taken into consideration when first getting into this line of work.
The damp conditions and decaying materials present in many leaky buildings create an ideal environment for moulds and fungi to flourish. There are hundreds of such moulds and many are relatively harmless. However, unless you’ve had the mould identified by a laboratory, it’s best to assume all moulds are potentially harmful and to take precautions.
One of the most prevalent and common varieties associated with adverse health effects is stachybotrys (stacci).
Chronic exposure to toxins produced by this fungus can result in cold and flu symptoms, memory loss, muscle aches, sore throats, diarrohea, headaches, fatigue, dermatitis, intermittent local hair loss, cancer and general feelings of unwellness. It has also been reported that the toxins can suppress and even destroy the immune system, affecting the lymphoid tissue and the bone marrow.
Eye-popping stuff! So what does that mean for the building occupants, those visiting the site and site staff? It’s not just an immediate hazard, there are longer-term implications, too.
It is the spores of this mould that are the most toxic, as they can contain chemicals called mycotoxins. Ingesting or inhaling these spores is when it’s at its most hazardous. Stacci typically grows on products containing cellulose, such as the paper on plasterboard lining and wood fibre-reinforced cement products in the presence of water. When this mould is damp, it is relatively inert, but when it dries out, spores become airborne and more hazardous. They can also contaminate other areas of the site.
1. Identify – It looks like a green/ black soot. Get expert advice to be sure.
2. Isolate – Dampen the area, and keep moist.
3. Document – For health and safety, variation claim and evidence reasons.
4. Remove – Get rid of the contaminated material and/ or use bleach solution only if appropriate. Contain to prevent spread of contaminants.
5. Dispose – Allowing contaminated materials to dry out could be hazardous; wrap in polythene and seal.
It’s important to ensure you and your employees are wearing the appropriate PPE gear, such as disposable suits, gloves, masks and goggles. But is it good enough just to supply it?
It’s possible to cross-contaminate other equipment while disrobing PPE, so it’s important to establish a procedure to prevent this happening and also decide what can be re-used or not.
A well-ventilated area should be set up for disrobing, with washing facilities for workers and their PPE.
It’s not just workers who are exposed to stacci and other hazards on site. There could be many more visitors than on a new build. For example, lawyers and experts for both sides of a legal dispute, designers and the council staff will probably be on site more often.
Occupants living in the building require careful H&S consideration, especially on tenanted multi-unit sites. How can a builder implement H&S policy in reality when fire egress paths, emergency lighting, fire-rated linings and decks are going to be impacted during works? Make sure the cosof keeping them safe 24/7 been allowed for in the contract.
Other hazards heightened on such projects require consideration. One of these is tarpaulin-affected scaffolding, which should not be lifted in dangerously strong winds. Dust is another, especially from cutting plaster cladding; this can be minimised by using dust extraction equipment on cutting gear.
While additional H&S risks potentially exist on these types of projects, they can be easily managed with planning and knowledge.

Staying sun smart over summer is a challenge many tradies will take on (and fail). If that’s you, check out Site Safe’s top tips and resources to help you protect yourself against harmful UV rays
We’re well into summer in Aotearoa, New Zealand, and many of us have welcomed the warmer weather with open arms.
However, the seasonal change also brings some added health and safety risks for those working onsite during the summer months and, while these can be easy to overlook, those who don’t take these risks seriously can pay the ultimate price.
The sun can be deadly
Skin cancer, mainly caused by overexposure to ultraviolet rays (UV), is the most common cancer in New Zealand, with more than 80,000 Kiwis getting it each year, according to the Cancer Society.
With this in mind, check out Site Safe’s list of practical safety advice below:
1. Slip into shade
Reduce your sun exposure where possible by taking regular breaks in the shade.
Avoid long periods of work in direct midday sunshine.
2. Slip on sun-protective clothing
Protect yourself with UV-protected clothing.
Wear UPF50+ rated lightweight long pants and long sleeved shirts in lighter colours with adequate air flow or ventilation to help keep your temperature down.
3. Slop sunscreen on exposed skin
Choose a broad-spectrum, water-resistant sunscreen of at least SPF30.
Ensure the AS/NZ 2604 standard is on the label.
Apply at least 15 minutes before going outside.
Reapply at least every two hours.
4. Slap on a hat
Use a hard hat with a front brim.
If the back of your neck is going to be exposed to the sun for long periods of time, use a neck flap or a combination full brim with neck flap.
5. Wrap on tinted safety glasses
Wear close fitting, wrap-around styles.
Ensure the AS/NZ 1337 standard is on the glasses.
6. Hydrate
Drink plenty of water regularly throughout the day to stay hydrated.
Keep a water bottle nearby and drink before you are thirsty.
Drink 150 to 200ml of water every 15 to 20 minutes, rather than consume a 1L drink every now and again.
Most people need about eight glasses of water per day, but if you’re working in all day heat, it’s likely you will need more.
Drinking water is preferable to drinking coffee, tea and energy drinks.
You can still enjoy the odd tea or coffee as they are only mildly diuretic. However, energy drinks contain large amounts of caffeine (and sugar), which can have more extreme diuretic effects and can lead to dehydration.
The Site Safe summer safety poster can be downloaded for free.
Site Safe members also have exclusive access to our Working in Summer toolbox talk, which identifies hazards, symptoms and signs, and specific controls to best manage these risks. You can access them on the Site Safe website.
The Cancer Society and WorkSafe NZ also have some valuable resources and safety tips on being sun smart and working safely in extreme temperatures. They can be found at sunsmart.org.nz and on the worksafe website.
Site Safe NZ Inc is a not-for-profit, membership-based organisation that promotes a culture of safety in the New Zealand construction and related industries.

Recent fatalities
surrounding the use of organic solvents prompted WorkSafe to release a safety
alert highlighting the serious health and safety risks when using such
chemicals
In two separate events, WorkSafe believes two workers fell
unconscious due to acute exposure to organic solvents. Both workers later died.
In one case, the worker was applying a UV treatment to
windows; in the other case, the worker was applying adhesive while laying
carpet. Both the UV and adhesive contained organic solvents.
These examples show the high risk for workers when there are
no safety procedures in place to control the risk of organic solvents in
enclosed spaces with insufficient ventilation and lack of personal protective
equipment (PPE).
In such environments, short-term exposure to very high
levels of organic solvent vapours can cause headaches and dizziness or light-headedness,
progressing to unconsciousness, and even death.
Things to know
Organic solvents are known to be found in:
Adhesives (cyclohexane, acetone, toluene).
Paints and lacquers (toluene, xylene, methyl
ethyl ketone).
Degreasers (trichloroethylene,
perchloroethylene).
Printing (turpentine, white spirits, xylene).
They enter the body mainly through inhalation of vapour and/or
direct skin contact. Once in the bloodstream, these chemicals can cause serious
health effects.
Advice from WorkSafe
Before working with organic solvents, PCBUs should complete
a risk assessment and review their controls.
PCBUs can consider eliminating the use of organic solvents
by using solvent-free materials.
If this is not possible, then exposure can be minimised by:
Substituting less toxic ingredients or
water-based solvents.
Providing mechanical ventilation such as suction
units to increase fresh air in the work area.
Increasing natural ventilation by opening doors
and windows.
Working outside.
Further minimisation controls include:
Keeping lids on containers to prevent solvents
evaporating.
Disposing solvent-contaminated rags in sealed
metal containers.
Using only the minimum amount of solvent
required for the job.
Scheduling jobs using solvents for a cooler
period of the day and/or when fewer workers are around.
Never using solvents to remove paint or grease
from skin.
As a last resort, use appropriate PPE:
Use a suitable respirator with appropriate
organic vapour cartridge filters for the solvents used.
Ensure a respirator is fit-tested for the
worker, cleaned and maintained properly.
Wear suitable clothing to protect the skin
(coveralls and gloves).

Quick hitch devices save significant time during mobile plant operation, but small safety oversights can be fatal.
A quick hitch allows a bucket or other attachment to be quickly and easily connected and disconnected from an excavator or backhoe arm, saving significant time during mobile plant operation. To hold the attachment in place, quick hitch devices use a locking system consisting of either a manual locking pin or an automatic hydraulic pressure hitch.
If the attachment is the wrong size, it may not be able to be secured properly and the quick hitch will fail. If the locking system is not in place, the quick hitch might work for some time but then suddenly swing open, releasing the bucket or other attachment. In either situation, the consequences can be fatal.
Accidents usually happen because the quick hitch system has failed and the person struck by the bucket or other attachment was in an unsafe position – either underneath or in the vicinity.
Quick hitches should clearly display:
The model and serial number.
The manufacturer’s name.
The weight and maximum rated capacity.
Each lifting point’s capacity.
If safety pins and other shaped securing devices are used, operators must:
Ensure that they meet the quick hitch manufacturer’s specifications.
Keep them with the excavator or quick hitch device when not in use.
Ensure that attachments are fitted with the correct pin centres and diameters.
The excavator operator should:
Check the attachment size is suitable for the excavator or backhoe arm’s size.
Check the quick hitch is kept in good working order.
Check the safety pin is securely in place or the automatic system has engaged correctly: – before starting work, and – when fitting a different attachment.
Ensure that an exclusion zone is established below and around the vicinity of the bucket when using the excavator or backhoe, if there are other workers on the construction site. The exclusion zone applies to workers not immediately involved in the excavator or backhoe operation.
The operator should not use the plant unless they are satisfied the quick hitch is secure.
When disconnecting an attachment, the excavator operator should intentionally disengage the quick hitch.
While the operators are in the best position to safely install the quick hitches and operate the mobile plant, it’s still the employer’s responsibility to make sure the operators have the knowledge, training, experience and equipment to fulfill these important safety functions.
The site manager is also responsible for:
Making sure excavator and backhoe operators are trained in how to use the plant safely.
Making sure excavator and backhoe operators are competent to use the specific quick hitch on the plant they are using.
Verifying operator competency by assessment and monitoring.

Anyone who works outside in harsh conditions knows the chilly season takes its toll. With temperatures dropping, it’s time to think about protecting yourself and your workers from the elements
T he effects of the cold can range from an increased risk of injury and a reduction in work rate and quality, to a greater potential for damage to plant and equipment. The cold can also affect people’s ability to concentrate on the task at hand.
Working in cold temperatures can increase irritability and frustration and may even incline people to take shortcuts to finish faster.
Even moderately cold temperatures can increase the likelihood of workplace incidents.
This is because the body’s response to cold causes a decrease in manual dexterity, fingertip sensitivity and muscle strength. The degree of coldness can be underestimated if other factors such as wind chill are not considered.
People working outside should try to eliminate, or at best isolate, cold hazards. However, eliminating hazards can be difficult. Consider the following controls when working in the cold.
Food, shelter and wellbeing
Food and liquid intake are essential to maintain body heat and prevent dehydration.
More energy is exerted working in cold conditions, as the body is working hard to keep warm.
WorkSafe states that if continuous work is carried out in temperatures below 0°C, heated shelters such as cabins or ‘smoko’ rooms should be made available.
A strict timetable for breaks should be implemented to allow employees to warm up and change clothes if needed.
Training
Workers and supervisors should be trained to recognise the symptoms of cold exposure, such as hypothermia. Having a trained first aid person is also highly recommended.
Employees should be informed about PPE, safe work practices and emergency procedures in case of injury. While working in the cold, a buddy system should be used to look out for one another.
Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
Clothing should be worn in multiple polypropylene, polyester or merino layers, because the air between the layers provides better insulation. The outer layer should be hi-vis, rain and wind-proof and allow for easy opening and removal.
Exposed areas such as the head, hands and feet are just as important as the body. Gloves are an obvious option; however, these can become bulky and affect a worker’s manual handling, so a better option is to provide warm air blowers or insulated handles on tools.
Buy footwear that is well padded, insulated and made from materials such as leather, which allows the shoes to breathe. A great deal of heat is also lost through the head, a problem compounded by the fact that hard hats do not provide protection against the cold.
If a hard hat is necessary, wear a tightly fitted beanie made of polypropylene or merino underneath.
Equipment
The risk of cold injury can be minimised by equipment choice and design. Plant, equipment and tools should be designed so that they can be operated without having to remove items of PPE.
The more complex or fiddly the activity, the greater the likelihood that PPE will be discarded during the process, which leads to increased risk.
Plan
To avoid harsh winter conditions, plan work that is appropriate to the weather. Check weather reports before planning your jobs, so that outside tasks can be done on the best possible day.
If you cannot be adequately protected from the effects of the cold, then work must be suspended or rescheduled to remove the risk of harm.
Following these steps will ensure that winter does not slow you down and keep your team productive, happy and keen.

Summer is always a busy period for builders, which is great for those employed in the industry. However, it’s important to not overlook safety measures as work increases and recognise that employees have the right to certain conditions
E mployers must take ‘all practicable steps’ to ensure you and your fellow employees’ safety.
Employee health and safety rights on a work site
Work in a safe environment – employers must manage workplace hazards/risks and make sure employees know how to keep themselves safe. Hazards or risks are things that might cause harm to employees or their health.
Access to information – employers must provide information about workplace health and safety in a way employees can understand.
Training – training should occur before the work commences. Employees should be encouraged to ask for more training if they feel they need it. This includes the use of tools or equipment on site. Any standard operating procedures should be clearly explained and understood.
Work with safe machinery, vehicles, tools and equipment – all workplace tools, equipment, vehicles and machinery must be safe to use and in good working condition. All staff should check any equipment before use and ensure that those nearby are safe.
The basic necessities – toilets, hand-washing facilities, clean drinking water, first aid facilities and a place to have a meal break in reasonable comfort and shelter, must be available.
Workplace hazards/risks maintained – potential hazards/risks should be identified at least once every week, with all practical steps taken to eliminate or minimise these risks. A good chance to raise these is at toolbox talks or the pre-start meeting.
Correct Personal Protective Gear (PPE) – employers must provide correct PPE for the work undertaken: gloves, safety boots, hard hats, ear muffs, glasses, breathing protection etc.
Emergency procedures knowledge – employers must inform employees what to do in an emergency, such as a fire, earthquake or flood.
Accident prevention
Employees may refuse work that is likely to cause them serious harm and must take reasonable care to keep themselves safe, as well as avoid causing harm to other people. Employees have the right to be involved in improving health and safety on the worksite.
Had an accident?
Accidents onsite must be recorded in the site register. Serious injuries at work must also be reported to WorkSafe New Zealand.
Knowing your rights for a safe working environment is important. If you see something that is not right, say something. Discussing and making sure correct safety is conducted on site makes a happier, healthier working environment for everyone.
To find out more about Site Safe and health and safety, contact us on 0800 SITE SAFE or check out our Site Specific Safety Plan page on our website at www.sitesafe.org.nz/SSSP .
According to Statistics New Zealand, a total of 226,100 claims were made to ACC for work-related injuries in 2014.
Of those, the construction industry (32,400) made the second-highest number of claims behind manufacturing. The construction industry also recorded the third-highest incidence rate of claims, with 172 claims per 1,000 full-time employees (FTEs). A total of 28,100 entitlement claims, which reflect more serious injuries, were made. The construction industry (4,400) made the second most claims and was again the third-highest by incidence rate, with 23 claims per 1,000 FTEs.
Site Safe is a national not-for-profit membership organisation that promotes, supports and inspires a culture of health and safety in the NZ construction industry.

Worksafe has released a new guide to help manage risks and protect yourself and others from asbestos fibres
Asbestos is a dangerous substance that can lead to fatal diseases, and builders are among the highest at risk. This is because they often work with products that may contain asbestos, such as fibreboard, lino and vinyl flooring, and laminated bench tops in kitchens.
Note: The guide offers advice for builders who work by themselves or have other people working for them. This only provides tips on how to avoid irritating asbestos or working around asbestos. It is important to note that licensed professionals should be the only ones to remove or manage asbestos, as this process must be executed correctly to avoid hazards.
If you uncover or damage asbestos containing materials (ACM):
Stop work immediately
Keep people away
Minimise the risk of contamination/spreading
Get advice from asbestos experts
In the event that asbestos needs to be removed:
A licensed asbestos remover must remove all friable asbestos (in powder form).
For non-friable asbestos (not able to be crumbled) over 10m 2 , a licensed asbestos remover must be contacted to deal with the removal
Breathing in airborne asbestos poses a serious risk to people’s health, causing lung cancer, asbestosis, mesothelioma or other lung diseases.
Symptoms for diseases like those mentioned above can take between 10 to 40 years before they start to appear. This emphasises the need for safe work practices to protect workers from exposure to asbestos fibres.
Any building built before January 2000 is likely to contain some form of asbestos. Even some recently constructed buildings may have asbestos or asbestos containing materials (ACM).
It is important to note that asbestos and ACMs are not dangerous if they are in good condition and remain undisturbed to avoid any airborne fibres from being released.
Commercial or industrial site:
When you begin the planning process and arrive at site, ask if there is an Asbestos Management Plan. If asbestos or ACM is found or is expected to be discovered, the PCBU along with management must prepare an Asbestos Management Plan.
This management plan must tell you the location and conditions of any asbestos on site, or where it is expected to be. It must also point out how the identified asbestos should be managed on site.
At a residential site:
Ask the homeowner if they are aware of any asbestos in and around the house. If no one is certain, carry out checks so control measures can be put in place if any is encountered.
Training:
The best way to learn how to identify and safely work around asbestos is to attend asbestos awareness training. Courses are available across New Zealand and usually take a couple of hours.
Protection:
It is imperative builders take measures to protect themselves when working near asbestos, no matter how small the job is. If possible, plan the job so that no asbestos is disturbed, and don’t start work until having the right information and training to work safely.
Reduce dust:
Keeping ACM damp (but not too wet) prevents dust fibres from circulating.
Before starting a job, you can wet ACM by using a low-pressure water spray such as a hand-held squirt bottle. Maintain the appropriate level of wetness while working to reduce the chances of asbestos becoming airborne.
Do not use a high-pressured hose to wet ACM, as this will irritate the asbestos and increase the risk of breathing it in.
Use dust collection equipment wherever possible, and use plastic sheets to cover your work area.
Restrict power tool use:
There are regulations that restrict the use of power tools for asbestos work. Power tools and other equipment may only be used around asbestos if they are used in an enclosed area or designed to capture/suppress asbestos.
Wear the right equipment:
Respiratory protective equipment protects builders from breathing in hazardous substances.
A disposable ‘P2’ mask is the minimum amount of protection required. It’s important to make sure your mask fits correctly and that facial hair isn’t creating any gaps that asbestos may breach.
Disposable coveralls also stop asbestos from getting on your clothes. Wearing a pair that is slightly too big helps prevent any rips at the seams.
Footwear should completely cover each foot.
All asbestos waste must be disposed at an authorised disposal site. Local councils can help find a dump that accepts asbestos waste.
All waste, including disposable protective gear, should be double-bagged in heavy-duty plastic bags and sealed so that contents are fully enclosed. The bags should be clearly marked that they contain asbestos waste.

Running a business can be a daunting task for many people, especially when they’re just starting out. A common enquiry Site Safe gets from new business owners is how to set up a health and safety policy. This is designed to help anybody looking to answer that question
If you’re in the process of setting up a new company, then putting together a robust health and safety policy should be one of your first priorities, as you’re legally required to provide your staff with a safe workplace.
An easy way to think about a health and safety system is to break it down into five main parts:
Policies and procedures.
Managing risks and hazards.
Managing staff and contractors.
Administration of your health and safety system.
Leadership
Policies and procedures
These provide a structure for your company when it comes to handling health and safety, and are the foundation of your system. Essential elements include:
Policy statement – your overarching policy.
Code of conduct.
Operational policies.
Emergency management plan.
Managing risks and hazards
Under the Health and Safety at Work Act 2015, business owners and leaders are required to manage any risks facing workers and any other person/s that may be affected by their work.
This means that hazards must be identified, assessed, controlled and monitored. There are several ways this can be done:
Hazard/incident register.
Risk assessment matrix.
Hazardous products and substances register.
Workplace inspections.
Plant and equipment register.
Monitoring activities.
Hazard boards and danger signs.
Managing staff and contractors
Ensuring your workers and contractors are safe at work is one of your main priorities as a business owner. The following are essential elements of your health and safety system when it comes to keeping your people safe:
Code of conduct – provides clearly set ‘house rules’ for your workers and contractors on how you expect people to behave while at work.
Worker involvement in their own health and safety – allowing people to be part of the process will encourage engagement and ownership of health and safety in your business.
Induction, training and competency supervision – workers need to be inducted into a new workplace; this provides information and outlines your expectation of them immediately.
Training and assessment – you need to make sure workers are competent enough to safely perform the tasks expected of them. If workers are not competent, they need to be supervised.
Tools you can use to ensure that you are managing the health and safety of your people are:
Visitor/site induction register.
Training and competency register.
Training pathway.
Personal protective equipment and clothing register.
Administration of your health and safety system
It’s important to keep on top of your system once it is in place. Keeping records not only allows you to remain compliant, it also gives you the opportunity to see what, if anything, you are achieving. This means that regularly reviewing and keeping your system up-to-date is important.
Site Safe recommends that you regularly review daily or weekly operational records, such as:
Hazard identification.
Incident reports.
Inspection results.
Induction register.
Pre-starts.
It’s also recommended you review your strategic data and targets annually. This process helps you to set goals for the coming year.
Leadership
Safety starts at the top and it requires you to invest your time in creating a plan everyone can get on board with. Site Safe’s Health and Safety Kit is a good place to start. The kit provides you with detailed information, processes and forms that a business should have as part of their health and safety system. The kit provides further detail on the framework above, including a copy of all the documents and forms mentioned. Go to sitesafe.org.nz to find out more.

Site Safe gets a number of questions from people in the construction and building sector via their ‘Ask an Advisor’ website page. Under Construction takes a look at two such questions that might be relevant to you and your crew
Working at Height
Question: What is the legal requirement in terms of the number of people working on a roof? Can one person be on any roof on their own without any ground support whether it is for maintenance or repairs, staying 1.8m away from the edge without protection?
Site Safe’s advisor says : There is no regulation for the number of people working on a roof at one time. As roof work means working at height it is considered a high-risk situation. This means the legal requirement is that the Person Conducting a Business or Undertaking (PCBU) needs to conduct a risk assessment and apply the hierarchy of controls based on the outcomes of the assessment. The implementation of a “voluntary 1.8m exclusion zone” is not an adequate control in any height situation, regardless of the number of workers. This would be an administrative control and is only suitable for supporting other controls (higher up the control hierarchy).
The law requires that where high risk cannot be eliminated, it must be minimised through one or a combination of:
Substitution.
Isolation.
Engineered controls.
For more information on the use of scaffolds, check out the scaffolds page under the Practical Advice section of the Site Safe website.
Radio muffs
Question : I have been approached by my team around the use of ear protection (muffs) that are fitted with radios. What are the laws around these and their use in a workplace?
Site Safe’s advisor says : There are no laws regarding hearing protection; these are covered by standards and practice guidelines. Good practice is that the ear protection must reduce the noise to an acceptable level. This means they must be manufactured to an acceptable industry standard and must meet the noise reduction requirements. If fitted with radios, then they should not be worn where the radio would interfere with critical communications (verbal communication, alarms, audio alerts, etc).
Ask an Advisor
If you have a non-urgent health and safety query, get in touch with Site Safe online and ‘ ask an advisor’ .

After Site Safe analysed the most common requests it receives through its online query system, it identified a surprising trend, which is that information about when to wear a hard hat and how to properly maintain them was in hot demand! This article should help to answer any questions you might have
Hard hats are one of the most common pieces of protective gear on site, which means they can often be overlooked when it comes to proper maintenance and care. Site Safe has put together some useful tips to make sure you are getting the most from this key piece of PPE.
Do I need a hard hat?
Hard hats that comply with NZS 5806 , or other suitably approved head protection, must be worn at all times while on site where there is a risk of objects falling from above. In fact, hard hats are becoming mandatory on most sites in New Zealand.
Hard hats should be worn in any area that has the potential for workers:
To be hit or struck by falling, fixed, moving or protruding objects.
To come in contact with electricity.
Be exposed to UV, weather, and temperature extremes.
Choosing the right hard hat for the job
Hard hats come in a range of styles to suit all types of work:
Industrial – suitable for use in construction, factories and quarries.
High temperature – suitable for use in processes such as steel and glass manufacturing.
Bushfire fighting – suitable for use by emergency personnel for combating bush fires.
Peakless – allowing clear upward vision.
Peaked – providing shade for the eyes and some facial protection.
Full brim – providing fuller protection from falling objects and UV, as well as water.
Some hard hats can be fitted with accessories such as face shields, respirators, hearing protection and work lamps. When selecting your hard hat, you should also consider whether ventilation or hi-viz colouring is of benefit.
How hard hats work
Hard hats comprise of a hard outer shell designed to take the initial impact and an inner harness designed to absorb and  spread this impact, minimising the effects of the force to the skull.
How must a hard hat be worn?
Adjust the harness cradle to ensure comfort and total contact with your head at all times.
It’s recommended you don’t wear bulky clothing items on your head, as this will result in the harness cradle becoming ineffective. This includes hoods, baseball caps, thickly woven or heavily seamed beanies or balaclavas. Some hairstyles, such as dreadlocks, are also not recommended. Safety clothing distributors offer seamless polypropylene beanies, which do not interfere with the performance of the harness cradle.
To secure your hard hat, you can use the elastic chinstraps, or a four-point retaining strap integrated with a harness when working at height. The elastic chinstrap is recommended to secure the hat and prevent it being moved by the wind.
Ensure any attachments are compatible with the make and model of the hard hat. If you have any specific questions about wearing your hard hat, it is a good idea to check with the manufacturer.
When should I replace my hard hat?
Hard hats do not have an expiry date; however, it’s a good idea to record the date of issue by writing on the inside of the hat with a marker and replace the hat every two or three years.
Please note: that means the date that you are issued the hat, not the date of manufacture.
Your hat should be inspected weekly for signs of damage, such as dents or cracks. A simple test is to squeeze the sides of the hard hat together and listen and feel for signs of stress or cracking, which indicates brittleness and deterioration. If your hat shows any signs of deterioration, replace it immediately.
Components such as the sweatbands and harness may deteriorate more rapidly and may need to be replaced.
Looking after your hard hat
Store in a cool, dry environment away from direct sunlight and heavy or sharp objects.
Keep your hard hat away from chemicals, including paints, paint thinners, solvent-based adhesives (stickers) and cleaning agents.
Clean by scrubbing and immersing in warm soapy water, and rinsing in clean warm water.
Sweatbands must be regularly replaced as required.
If the hat loses its glossy finish and appears chalky, the shell must be replaced.
Training
Employers are responsible for ensuring their workers are trained in the safe use, care and maintenance of hard hats. This training should include:
The hazards controlled by hard hat use.
How the hard hat works.
Limitations of hard hats.
When hard hats must be worn.
How to wear a hard hat correctly.
How to adjust the hard hat for comfort and fit.
How to correctly store a hard hat.
How to identify signs of wear or damage.
How to clean and maintain their hard hat.

Working with electricity can be dangerous and accidents are often fatal. Because no device can offer 100% protection from electrocution, it’s important you take electrical safety seriously
T he two main ways that electricity can cause harm is either via an electric shock or arc flash. Electric shocks (electric current passing through your body) can cause severe burns and potentially dangerous involuntary movements.
Arc flash (a release of energy) can result in:
Blast injuries
Lung injuries
Ruptured eardrums
Shrapnel wounds
Severe burns
Blindness
General safety tips
You should consider all electrical wires and equipment live until proven otherwise. It’s also important to consider the following:
Display safety signage when electrical work is under way.
Inspect cords, plugs and electrical equipment before each use.
Repair or replace damaged equipment immediately.
Secure extension cords to the wall or floor using tape (don’t use nails or staples, as they can cause a fire or shock).
Avoid outlets or cords that have exposed wiring.
Use extension cords or equipment that are rated for your type of work (ie commercial-graded equipment for work on site).
Warm or hot outlets can be a sign that unsafe wiring conditions exist.
Use ladders made with non-conductive materials, such as fibreglass.
Locate the electrical panel and circuit breakers in case of an emergency.
Label circuit breakers and fuses clearly.
Inspecting electrical equipment
All electrical appliances, tools and leads should undergo regular testing – what we all know as ‘test and tag’. The frequency of testing a device is determined by where it is used:
New appliances – before first use.
Building sites – every three months.
Factories – every six months.
Most other applications, such as office equipment, should be tested either yearly, or up to five years in some situations (seek professional advice).
Use the inbuilt testing button to manually test RCDs before use. Where faults are detected with an appliance, it should immediately be marked “out of action” and repairs carried out by a professional.
Common electrical hazards
The biggest risks with electrical equipment include handling damaged equipment or using the incorrect tool for the job. Tools left on while not in use also pose a big risk, so be sure to turn off all equipment when you’ve finished with it.
Worksites can also pose a number of electrical hazards, if power lines, underground services or excessive water are present.
Check sockets are not overloaded and that the supply is earthed when there are many contractors on site.
Workers themselves can also be a hazard. Ensure your team is qualified and authorised to carry out electrical work. In addition, keep an eye on fatigue and ensure that people are not under the influence of drugs or alcohol.
Only someone with a current licence issued by the Electrical Workers Registration Board (EWRB) should be carrying out repairs or modifications to appliances or tools.

Summer is in full swing and it’s a great time to get cracking on lots of jobs, but it can present extra health and safety risks. Heat exhaustion, fatigue and dehydration are all things to watch out for when working in the heat
Site Safe’s central regional manager Jeff Strampel says knowing the danger signs is vital when working in the heat.
“If heat stress or exhaustion is not dealt with quickly, it can progress to heat stroke, which can be life-threatening,” says Strampel.
“Unfortunately, New Zealand has one of the highest melanoma rates in the world. Kiwis need to know that exposure to our harsh UV rays can lead to melanoma or other skin cancers.”
“It can be tempting to take on too much work, especially if you’ve been waiting for good weather to get started on a job – but just remember to take a step back and think about the task before you get stuck in,” says Strampel.
“Smart planning makes the job safer.”
Be careful when doing these types of work, which make you more likely to suffer heat exhaustion:
Working in the direct sun
Working near heat-producing processes
Working in confined spaces
Doing underfloor, ceiling or roof work
In cabs of mobile plant
Closed areas with limited airflow
Danger signs
Make sure you know the danger signs to look out for when working in the heat. If you do overheat, you’ll notice symptoms like:
Clammy or sweaty skin
Feeling weak or dizzy
Dark-coloured urine
Pounding or rapid pulse
Loss of balance
Headaches
Muscle cramps
Mood changes or confusion
Tips for staying safe
Tool up : use the right tools for the job and try to switch tasks regularly if using vibrating power tools. Consider low-vibration hand-held tools and, where practical, install low-vibration seats  in machinery; whole-body vibration can cause fatigue, headaches and loss of balance. Rotate tasks between workers and make sure workloads and deadlines are realistic.
Be cool : wear lightweight, breathable clothing if it’s safe to do so, but be sure to comply with your company’s clothing and PPE regulations. Remember to wear a hat, safety sunglasses and good quality sunblock. With any sunglasses, always check the impact and UV rating.
Don’t sweat it : stay hydrated with lots of water. Avoid dehydrating drinks containing caffeine or alcohol. People need about eight glasses of water per day, but if you’re working in the heat, it’s likely you will need more.
Go with the flow : think about airflow and use fans to provide ventilation and keep the temperature down if necessary.
Be the man/woman with the plan : if you have several jobs to do outside, think about where the sun is and which jobs you might be able to do first to avoid being in full sun for too long.
Take a break : if possible, consider taking a break and heading inside during the hottest part of the day. Have regular breaks and consider extra breaks if the work is demanding. Monitor and place limits around overtime and avoid incentives to work too many hours. If you need to work longer hours, consider staggered start and finish times, and longer breaks and periods off work. Try to set realistic deadlines and timeframes for jobs.

Health and safety organisation Site Safe says a solid foundation for wellbeing will set your business up for success
Creating a healthy workplace starts with a solid foundation for wellbeing – the overall physical, mental, emotional, spiritual, and social health of people.
Mental wellbeing is feeling good, functioning well, and feeling connected. Looking after wellbeing has benefits for employees and business and can lead to both individual and business success.
Looking inwards
Looking after your own wellbeing can help you increase your confidence, improve relationships with others, reduce physical health problems, and cope better with stress and change. This could look like:
Getting active for at least 30 minutes a day – hit the gym, take the dog for a walk, play with your family at the park, spend time in the garden, or even practice yoga.
Eating healthy, balanced, and regular meals and staying hydrated.
Sharing your time and knowledge – volunteer in your community, offer a helping hand, or do something nice for a friend or stranger.
Always learning – embrace new experiences, remain curious, and work towards your goals.
Connecting with others – talking to people you trust and being open to listening to others.
Taking notice of the things that bring you joy – reading a good book, watching your favourite TV series, or spending quality time with family and friends.
Looking outwards
When someone is struggling with their mental health and wellbeing, it can be hard for them to speak up and ask for help. Signs and symptoms of someone struggling with their mental health and wellbeing may include:
Low productivity.
Inability to concentrate.
Explained or unexplained absence from work.
Changes in behaviour and mood.
Avoiding social activities.
Increased use of alcohol and/or drugs.
Fatigue, stress, and/or anxiety.
If you notice someone showing any of these signs or symptoms, make sure they know you are there to listen openly and without judgement whenever they want to talk.
Wellbeing at work
Prioritising wellbeing in the workplace can result in a number of benefits for workers and business owners, such as a more positive work culture, happier and more engaged staff, increased productivity, higher staff retention, and better health and safety outcomes. For businesses and employers, this could include:
Being a good role model for healthy behaviour and ensuring others feel comfortable speaking up and asking for help when they need it.
Being proactive, open, honest, and free of judgement.
Ensuring they meet the legal responsibilities to protect health and prevent harm at work, as per the Health and Safety at Work Act 2015.
Emphasise the importance of work-life balance and how to manage work-related stress.
Investing time and money – spend time ensuring staff feel valued and invest in activities and services that can benefit the mental health and wellbeing of workers.
Resource and training
Leading health and safety organisation Site Safe New Zealand is on a journey to work with the construction industry to shift the approach to wellbeing in the workplace and set people up for success with the tools and resources they need to support.
Since the release of a 2019 research report conducted by Site Safe into suicide in New Zealand’s construction industry, there has been acknowledgement from industry that mentally healthy and well workplaces have benefits for both health and safety and business success.
“We know how important it is to destigmatise the idea of looking after ourselves, especially in our industries who have typically had more of a ‘toughen up’ attitude when it comes to our wellbeing,” said Brett Murray, Site Safe New Zealand Chief Executive.
“We already work with key partners like MATES in Construction and Hato Hone St John to provide resources and training courses focusing on mental health in the construction industry, but we knew there was more we could do to support our industry and members, and in particular small organisations, who often don’t have the financial resources to invest in this area.”
Partnership helps site safe provide more
This year, Site Safe has partnered with Ignite Aotearoa to give Site Safe members free access to their online platform and a large range of mental health and wellbeing resources, information, and workshops.

According to Worksafe, approximately 700-1,000 deaths are caused every year in New Zealand as a result of occupational diseases. To ensure your workers are protected – and avoid a hefty fine – make sure you take the proper precautions
One of the biggest contributors to fatal occupational diseases is respiratory illness, which is a significant threat in the construction industry – particularly silica dust.
Silica is the most abundant material in the earth’s crust and is present in concrete, fibre-cement products and rock. Silica dust causes a number of health problems including silicosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and increased chances of lung cancer.
The best way to prevent exposure to dust is to keep it out of the air. Using water and wet working methods is a good way to keep it out of your worker’s lungs.
Make sure you have hoses available to wet any dust created before it becomes airborne, ensure work areas and equipment are frequently washed down and avoid using compress air.
When purchasing equipment, look for tools equipped with water and vacuum attachments to control dust at the source. Certified respirators that are suitable to dust levels and particle size should be worn to prevent inhalation. WorkSafe recommends:
Disposable respirators for low-to-medium dust levels.
Half-face respirators for low-to-medium dust levels.
Full-face respirators for medium-to-high dust levels and people with beards.
Full-face powered respirator for very high dust levels.
You should also monitor the air quality around your worksite to measure how exposed your workers are to silica dust. It will also help you select the most appropriate control methods and protection for your workers.
WorkSafe New Zealand is funding a silica dust monitoring project in Christchurch; the findings are expected to be published in May.
While asbestos products ceased being produced in the 1980s, it is still common in many buildings across New Zealand and has been a major WorkSafe New Zealand focus over the last 12 months.
An Auckland builder was recently fined $40,000 in the Auckland District Court after being sentenced under Health and Safety in Employment (Asbestos) Regulations and the Health and Safety in Employment Act.
As a result of his failure to properly test textured ceilings for asbestos during a renovation project, up to 15 contractors were potentially exposed to the harmful dust for three months.
“It is recommended practice to treat any suspect material, like textured ceilings, as containing asbestos until test results prove otherwise,” says Brett Murray, WorkSafe’s general manager for high hazards and specialist services. “Asbestos poses a risk if it is not properly contained, especially during building work where materials are cut or drilled.”

Sometimes a near-miss is a wake-up call that can change a life
This was definitely the case for Sione Lolohea, who had a bad year
after being caught working at heights without his safety harness attached – but
went on to have a great one when wearing a harness saved his life.
The winner of the Safety Contribution Award at last year’s Site
Safe Health and Safety Awards, Sione is now a key safety trainer and mentor for
APS Ltd in Auckland and is described by the company’s general manager as a
hero.
APS is a multi-trade commercial property maintenance specialist
that employs roofers, builders, painters and working at height specialists. A
builder by trade, Sione was recruited into the heights team eight years ago.
After an early mistake – when he was spotted wearing an unattached harness –
Sione was quick to change his ways and adopt the strict APS approach to safety.
It was a change which probably saved his life, according to APS General
Manager David Karam.
“About 12 months later, Sione was installing a fall arrest system
on a brittle roof when the sheet exploded and he fell between eight and ten
metres towards the concrete floor.
“Thankfully, he had installed a temporary fall arrest system,
which stopped his fall in mid-air. He was able to abseil to the ground without
a scratch.”
David says his lucky escape made him an overnight hero within the
company.
“He had turned a huge corner in his life and stepped up, and from
that point onwards the team saw him as a bit of a hero. He really woke up to
the risks that we are exposed to and the impact he can have as a leader and a
senior member of the team.”
The near-miss experience also gave Sione a unique advantage as he
went on to become the senior heights trainer at APS.
“The experience gives his training such realism. He’s become an invaluable team member and made quite a cultural shift for both himself and those around him.”
Sione now works with all new abseilers as a coach and mentor and
inducts new employees into the heights team.
“For us, we are able to utilise
his skills and mana to our advantage,” David says.
“We can get up and preach about safety… but nothing brings it home
to the guys like his story about that near-miss experience – and how if he
hadn’t learnt from that he would have been dead or crippled today.”
“There’s so many guys that think that they are bulletproof and
Sione has a great story to tell them.”
David says Sione’s “gentle giant” personality also makes him an
ideal coach.
“He’s not bolshy or arrogant; he’s a quiet guy with a big smile
and an incredibly giving person – the sort of guy who will provide after-hours
help and volunteers to come in on the weekend. He’s just very giving and
thoughtful – if anyone needs a hand, he’s always willing.”
For Sione, winning the Site Safe award was a big honour, but it’s
really all about helping his teammates.
“I like to share the knowledge and skills that I’ve gained in
health and safety, and what I’ve learned so far at APS,” says Sione.
“The guys all come from different backgrounds, and it’s great to
see them evolve from a nervous person when they first start, to getting the
confidence and sharing their own knowledge with the team.

“Every
time we are up on the roof, we are putting ourselves on the line, so we need to
trust each other and know that everyone is taking safety seriously.”

The summer season is a great time to get building work done. Here are a few safety tips to help you to make the most of the longer days
D uring summer, injury and fatality rates for builders remain high – with that in mind, consider the following and make sure your health and safety policies are up to date.
New Zealand has one of the highest rates of skin cancer in the world. Even though it’s great to get out and enjoy  a bit of sunshine, make sure you follow basic rules such as wearing a hat and using a good-quality sun block.
Safety sunglasses, to protect eyes both from flying objects and from UV rays, are also a good idea. With any sunglasses, always check the impact and UV rating.
Most falls are from a low height, either from a ladder or sub-standard temporary work platform. Consider:
Accessibility: plan the access on your job, to ensure it is suitable for the work.
Investment: resist the temptation to take cheap short cuts, in order to save a few dollars.
Equipment: invest in a good-quality and appropriate work platform. Make sure it is robust enough to support you and your equipment.
The most common causes of strain/sprain injuries are heavy and awkward lifting, and untidy work areas. Consider:
Posture: bend at the knees, not the back.
Make sure you your work area is organised and kept tidy.
Use lifting aids, such as trolleys and barrows. Also, consider the use of workbenches and clamps.
Injuries from power tools can be some of the worst, such as lacerations from bladed tools. Pay attention to your technique. Work away from yourself while maintaining a firm grip on your tools, and secure your work to a bench or table.
A common cause of electrocution is power tools striking electrical cables.
A relatively new electrocution risk is when installing under-floor insulation, as installers may accidentally staple through electrical cables.
You should always locate any wiring before cutting into a structure, always use industrial-rated tools and leads, and employ a residual current device (RCD).
Finally, you should consider footwear,eye protection, hearing protection and gloves as the minimum requirements for PPE. Some jobs will also require respiratory protection and a safety helmet.
To ensure a successful and safe building project, it is important to plan, use appropriate equipment, and use safe work methods.

Whether at home or work, we all love getting our hands on big, grunty power tools. They make jobs so much easier and faster, but they do come with some risks
Before you start on a job using power tools, stop and think about the work area, the tool itself and the operator. It will make you and your colleagues much safer on the job.
Hazards around you:
If you are creating sparks, have you removed all flammable items?
Is there any traffic in, or near, the work area?
Are there power sources in the area?
If you are cutting into floors, walls, or ceilings – have you identified any conduits?
If it’s a home project, pay particular attention to children. You should also consider any pets or animals in the vicinity.
The materials you’re working on should be secure, so that both your hands are free. It should also be off the ground, to provide the most comfortable operating position. Consider using a work bench and vice, sawhorses or clamps.
Make sure the tool is in good condition and not damaged. You should pay particular attention to guards, dead man switches and electrical leads. Check the leads for cuts, wear, heat damage, or exposed wires.
It’s recommended that when purchasing tools, you buy known brands from reputable suppliers, such as PlaceMakers – they’re more likely to have all the necessary safety features and last longer. For commercial use, the minimum of IP33 standard applies – remember that domestic tools are for home use only.
Use your power tool in conjunction with a residual current device (RCD). This is mandatory in the workplace and is highly recommended for around the house.
Modern homes and workplaces will have RCDs built into the electrical system; however, older buildings may not. You can purchase RCDs at a relatively low cost. Consider purchasing an RCD that meets or exceeds IP33 standards , also consider purchasing power tools that meet or exceed AS/NZ standards .
Additionally for workplaces, electrical leads and appliances are required to be periodically tested and tagged by a qualified person. The period varies depending on the workplace:
Three months for building and construction.
Six months for workshops.
The tool must, at a minimum, meet IP33 standard . This refers to protection from water and identifies the power tool as commercial and fit to operate on construction sites.
Ensure power tools are well maintained and that blades are kept sharp. Sharp tools are easier to use, produce better quality work and are less likely to jam or kick back. Make sure the tool is fit for purpose and, if a less dangerous tool can be used to complete the same task, use it.
All power tools create harmful levels of noise, particularly if used for extended periods. The usual control method is to wear hearing protection – either earplugs or earmuffs. Don’t be tempted to go cheap on hearing protection. Go for items that have been classified to a known manufacturing standard such as AS/NZS 1270 .
Hearing damage starts at about the same level as an idling bulldozer, which is 85 decibels. If you have to significantly raise your voice to speak to a person within about one metre from where you’re standing, then it’s too loud, and you are already damaging your hearing.
Power tools can also create flying debris, which could damage your eyes. Wearing a rated pair of wraparound, close-fitting safety glasses will generally be sufficient in most situations. Where you’re using angle grinders or similar tools, you will need a full face shield – if a grinding wheel disintegrates during operation, a pair of safety glasses will not provide protection to your face (the important standard here is AS/NZS 1336 ).
Activities such as sanding, sawing and grinding will create dust, so make sure you’re wearing a quality dust mask. A P1 or P2 class mask will take care of dust particles; if you need to protect against fumes, you will need a respirator fitted with an appropriate cartridge. All respirators should adhere to a known standard, such as AS/NZS 1716 .
It’s good practice to place carbon filters in a sealed bag when not in use.
To prevent injuries from other accidents that may happen, ensure you are wearing the appropriate safety gear. Consider gloves, safety boots, a hard hat, chaps and anything else that is required.
A few minutes taken before you start will mean the job is done faster, safer and to a higher standard. Don’t forget our advisors are always available to answer any questions you have. Site Safe has a free ‘Ask an Advisor’ tool on the website.

Bullying or intimidating behaviour on a worksite may stem from poor planning, and can lead to workers taking unnecessary risks
M ost employers have policies in place to deal with workplace bullying. Construction is one industry with a culture that can give rise to bullying behaviour.
This can come in the form of the saying ‘harden up’, which can force workers to step out of their comfort zones and perform unsafe acts.
Not only does bullying affect people physically and mentally, it can disrupt workplaces, reduce profits and reduce productivity through:
Increased time off.
Unhappy staff.
More mistakes and accidents.
Resignations.
Bad reputation.
Difficulty recruiting.
Poor quality and customer service.
Types of bullying
Bullying falls into two categories:
Personal attacks (direct) – the most common and easily recognised.
Task-related attacks (indirect) – often goes unnoticed.
Personal attacks (direct) typically focus on one person. Examples include making belittling remarks, insults, threats, excluding staff and physical attacks.
Task-related attacks (indirect) are linked to the victim’s actual work. Examples include giving unachievable tasks, not giving the appropriate training or tools for the job and supplying incorrect information.
You need to keep your eyes peeled for the many ways that bullying can take place. Bullies can target an individual or a group of workers using a range of methods to get to their victim(s), including through text, email, social media and before or after work.
What creates the onsite bully?
Construction projects can be stressful, as budgets and deadlines are often tight. Site Safe has identified that workers knowingly violate safety rules because of pressure from their boss or their peers to take shortcuts.
It’s easy to tell workers to ‘be safe’, but when they and their employers are under pressure to meet a deadline, workers understand the unwritten rules that say ‘just get the job done’. It’s at that point that unsafe behaviour arises, as there is often a view that safety slows you down.
Quality planning is the answer
A well thought-out plan that incorporates health and safety from the beginning will improve a company’s safety performance by generating:
Good contractor and employee relationships.
Effective communication.
Better problem solving.
Improved project planning and productivity.
Staff empowered to make decisions.
Monitored accountabilities.
Safe workers have a higher morale and are more productive. They can make huge improvements to the business by helping to identify and solve problems, contribute to planning and communications efforts and through overall better effort.
By expecting and understanding the hazards and risks involved in a job, then planning for them, safety and productivity naturally follow.
Site Safe provides free templates to assist your health and safety planning, available from sitesafe.org.nz/sssp .
WorkSafe NZ provides a free guide, Preventing and responding to workplace bullying , which includes support, examples and guidance for businesses and individuals about a widespread workplace hazard.
What to do
If you think you or someone at work is being bullied, keep records of what is happening and try to sort it immediately.
Use someone you trust as a sounding board to explore ways of responding–maybe your boss, HR team (if you have one), family or friends.
Site Safe is a not-for-profit, membership based organisation that promotes, inspires and supports a culture of health and safety in New Zealand construction.

One of the big safety challenges for those who operate or work around construction equipment is maintaining constant awareness of their blind spots
Accidents and incidents involving vehicles on construction sites are the biggest cause of fatalities in the construction industry. It’s vital that construction workers know how to work safely where vehicles and other pieces of plant are operating on a busy site; it’s easy to accidentally wander close enough to a machine to be struck.
Depending on the type of machinery involved – be it a truck, forklift, crane, excavator, bulldozer, grader or something else – the size of the blind spot varies, with some being quite large.
Site Safe has put together some helpful hints to help you stay safe around plant and vehicles.
Exclusion zones and spotters
Exclusion zones and separating workers from mobile plant should be the first option for managing risk. If exclusion is not possible, use spotters to control operations when workers are in the immediate area. A spotter should be in constant contact with the mobile plant operator.
Blind spots
Operators of construction equipment or machinery on site can often have severely restricted visibility of ground workers or nearby pedestrians, particularly when they are close to the equipment. To alert workers to the dangers of nearby equipment, warning devices should be fitted, such as a reversing alarm or a revolving light. They can also be fitted with reversing cameras to provide extra visibility for the operators.
Establish an effective system of communication based on two-way acknowledgement between mobile plant operators and ground workers before work starts. Train relevant workers in the procedures before they start work.
The system should stop ground workers from approaching mobile plant until the operator has agreed to their request to approach. Similarly, the system should stop operators from moving plant closer than a set distance from ground workers until they have advised the operator that they are aware of the proposed movement.
Mobile plant operators and workers should be familiar with the blind spots of the plant being used. Provide induction programs emphasising the dangers of working in close proximity to mobile plant and provide adequate supervision. Make sure operators and workers wear high-visibility personal protection equipment (PPE).
The images below show some of the blind spots for operators of typical construction equipment and machinery. Remember that limited visibility applies to both the front and back of plant.
Images supplied by WorkSafe New Zealand. You’ll find more information like this in Site Safe’s free passport handbook, a pocket-sized guide packed full of health and safety info. Download a copy here: https://goo.gl/yHxGhn .

Harmful noise exposure is a significant hazard that can cause hearing impairments such as ‘Industrial Deafness’ or ‘Trauma Induced Hearing Loss’. Therefore employers are required to take all practicable steps to mitigate it.
Legally, workplace noise cannot be above an average level of 85 decibels over eight hours or a peak level of 140 decibels, whether or not the worker is wearing personal hearing protection.
Here are some proactive steps you can take to protect yourself and your employees:
Employers should carry out noise surveys before starting work. A simple test to determine noise levels is to hold a conversation under normal operating conditions. If voices need to be raised, then the damage risk criteria of 85 dB(A) has probably been exceeded.
Understand how long employees will be exposed to the harmful noise.
Find the sources of noise.
Come up with ways to block and control the noise.
Decide on appropriate hearing protection.
Use the standard AS/NZS 1269 for guidance on noise assessment and management.
A significant hazard is the actual or potential cause of serious harm. That also means harm that occurs after exposure to the hazard – which is often the case with noise.
The table below provides some examples of the maximum exposure of common construction tools:
First, consider how to eliminate noise before minimising the hazard with hearing protection. When eliminating the noise isn’t possible, take steps to isolate and minimise the noise instead.
1. Eliminate the noise:
stop the noisy process, machine or equipment and use a different approach to get the job done.
2. Isolate the noise:
Use sound barriers.
Build baffles that enclose the noisy plant/equipment.
3. Minimise the noise:
Rotate tasks for workers.
Train and check that hearing protection is worn correctly.
Reduce noise and vibration with heavy rubber or synthetic mounts.
Wear ear muffs that are in good condition, fit properly and are appropriate to the noise level.
Make sure noise hazards are broughtto everyone’s attention with signs, notices, labelling and are spoken about at toolbox talk safety meetings.
4. Monitor the health of employees
Arrange hearing tests for all employees who work with hazardous noise.
This must be done by a competent person when an employee starts work and at intervals of no longer than 12 months.
5. Employers must provide information, training and supervision to staff in relation to hazards in the workplace
Educate workers on the dangerous effects of noise and how they can protect themselves from the hazard. Ensure that everyone onsite is wearing hearing protection – especially site leaders.

Each year, thousands of workers are hurt in accidents caused by slips, trips and falls. With wet, wintery weather never far away, now’s a great time to start thinking about how you can prevent these common on-site injuries
Many slips, trips and falls are preventable, and there are often low-cost solutions you can put in place to eliminate or control the risk.
Injuries caused by these accidents, such as to the ankle, knee or back, can leave workers with long-term problems that can significantly affect their quality of life. It’s important to remember that even falls from relatively low heights can cause serious injury or death.
The following are all hazards that can lead to an increased risk of injury from slips, trips and falls:
Poor housekeeping/messy sites.
Ground clutter.
Unstable surfaces.
Uneven or slippery floor surfaces.
Lack of signage.
Poor lighting.
Unmarked changes in floor levels.
Damaged flooring.
Lack of, or people not using, hand rails.
To reduce the risk, you should:
Keep work and access areas clear.
Take time to tidy as you work.
Pay attention to your surroundings.
Put tools away.
Wear suitable footwear with good grip.
Keep areas well-lit.
Keep deliveries and skips always from work areas and access points.
Isolate, barricade or cover penetrations, excavations, open cavities, manholes and access hatches – ensure they are clearly marked and identified.
Have designated areas for waste collection and provide skips and bins. Make sure everyone knows who is responsible for waste removal.
Use mechanical lifting aids rather than carrying heavy or unwieldy loads that block the view ahead.
Use cordless tools where possible. If you need to use cables for temporary lighting or power tools, run the cables at a high level.
Improve the design of the environment/site – eg, install handrails.
Communicate with workers and visitors about hazards.
Allow extra time when conditions are slippery.
Check your path is clear before carrying loads, and make sure you can see over and around your load.
Treat slippery surfaces with stone or grit, depending on the conditions.
Make sure you signpost any slippery areas.
Consider using a ramp for any changes in level. Where this is not possible, use signs to warn workers to look out for a level change.
Do a step back 5×5 – take five steps back, if it’s safe to do so, and spend five minutes planning the job.
Ask yourself:
What will I be doing?
What are the hazards?
What equipment and plant do I need?
How can I get hurt?
What if something unexpected happens?
When managing hazards on site, always choose the most effective controls that are proportionate to the risk and make sure they are appropriate to the situation. To download SiteSafe’s seven-point hazard analysis poster, click here .

Under the Health and Safety at Work Act 2015, you need to protect your workers and anyone else on site by managing risk – here’s some tips to help you manage your risk-identification protocols
Creating a healthy and safe work environment is not only an important legal responsibility for an employer, it can also lead to better productivity, better relations with contractors and happier workers.
Section 30 of the Health and Safety at Work Act 2015 requires employer’s to eliminate risks, so far as is ‘reasonably practicable’.
Reasonably practicable means considering the level of risk, what you know about how to control it and the cost in relation to the level of risk. This does not mean that if the control is too expensive it can be dispensed with: where the risk of death or serious injury exists, the question should be whether the job is worth the risk.
If you can’t eliminate the risk, then you must minimise it as far as is reasonably practicable. You need a process for assessing and managing the risks of all hazards, but not every hazard requires a formal process.
The Five-Steps to Managing Risk
If you are just starting out, begin with the major risks that could cause serious injury or death. The following steps will help create your own risk management strategies:
Identify
Assess the risk level of each hazard identified.
Control the risk to reduce the harm and its severity.
Reassess the level of risk for each hazard.
Review and monitor that controls are working and risk levels are acceptable.
Identify
Walk around your workplace with a staff member and identify what could seriously harm the health or safety of workers and others. Remember to consider both immediate safety hazards, such as falls, and gradual health hazards, like asbestosis.
Assess
Once you have identified the hazards, assess the level of risk for each. This is a great time to talk to your workers, as they are your greatest source of information during the risk assessment process.
They know and understand the jobs, how they can suffer potential harm and the controls that are/aren’t working. Your workers will often have great ideas for improvement, so just ask! To work out the level of risk, determine how likely it is to occur and what the possible severity of injuries could be. Using a risk matrix as a guide can be useful.
Control
Once you have identified the level of risk, you must do what is reasonable and practical to eliminate it. Where it can’t be eliminated, minimise it by choosing the best controls for the situation – the better the control, the lower the risk.
Common controls, such as Codes of Practice, guidelines and standard procedures can be applied for common risks. Remember to talk to subbies and anyone else on site about risks resulting from your work.
If you can’t eliminate a common risk, then apply common control measures. Use a risk register to record your common hazards and controls. If you can’t eliminate a specified risk and it is covered by regulations, or is high-risk, apply the ‘hierarchy of controls’ and use a Task Analysis or a Safe Work Method Statement. Controls can be ordered from most effective to least. This is called the “Hierarchy of Controls”. The most effective control is one that eliminates the risk, the least effective control is one that just minimises it, such as using PPE.
Substitute, isolate and engineer are classed as being as equally effective. You will often need to use multiple controls on a single risk.
Reassess
After putting controls in place, go back and reassess the level of risk. You may not always get your controls right the first time. If the new level of risk is still too high, go back and put different controls in place, then reassess.
Review and Monitor
You’ll need to review your controls regularly to:
Ensure your planned controls are being used.
Check that controls are effective.
Ensure your risk level estimate is correct.
Check in with workers if controls are convenient and effective.
Monitor exposure to health.
Identify new or different work activities and risks.
Consider if stronger controls are now possible.
Communicate the risks
Once your risks are identified and your controls are in place, make sure you document them in an easy-to-understand manner in a hazard/risk register. This summary of site hazards and steps taken to control them should be available at all times for PCBUs to use when inducting new contractors, sub-contractors or visitors to a site. A Site Job Hazard and Risk Register can be downloaded for free at

Recent events have served to remind us that natural disasters can strike at any time and no doubt they will have been a topic of conversation at your work place. It’s important that you’re ready for anything – be it an earthquake, fire or accident – so we’ve put together some tips to help you with your emergency response planning
People’s safety should be the first priority in any emergency. Make sure you have a system in place for getting in touch with all your staff and ensure their emergency contact details are up to date.
It’s also important that you keep track of how many of your team are on site and need to be accounted for. If evacuation is required, take the register to the evacuation point so you can sign everyone off. Also, check the sign-in register to make sure visitors are safe.
Preparation is key
The most important thing when it comes to dealing with emergencies is being prepared. The best way to ensure you and your staff are ready is to have a concise, well-tested emergency response plan.
Your emergency plan should include the following:
Locations of alternative exits.
Keep an up-to-date register of your emergency equipment (such as extinguishers, fire blankets); include when they were last tested and where they are located.
Make sure your staff know where the evacuation point is and ensure it’s in a safe place, away from obvious fire, earthquake or flooding hazards.
Make sure everyone is aware of what the emergency procedures are, and remind them at Toolbox Talks or prestart meetings.
Know where your nearest Civil Defence assembly point is.
Keep a list of what’s in your Civil Defence kit.
Where possible, make sure everyone has personal emergency supplies, which should include water, food, a First Aid kit and other emergency supplies.
Keep a list of people who have specific skills and responsibilities in an emergency and their contact details.
Keep a list of fire wardens and the date they were trained.
Keep a record of emergency plan tests and trial it regularly to ensure it’s effective.
Keep a list of emergency contacts, including useful services such as the doctor/medical centre, hospital, poison centre, local council, pollution hotline, neighbours, insurer, plumber and electrician.
In case of chemical/environmental emergency, store appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) on site. Make sure everyone is trained in the safe control of any chemicals you have on site and up to date with emergency procedures associated with their use.
When disaster strikes:
Turn on your radio for advice and information.
Know the Civil Defence warning signal.
Know your nearest Civil Defence post and Police station.
Makes sure you have provisions available in case you are stuck at work for several days.
Report to your manager any events that harm people or damage property.
If an earthquake strikes while you’re at work, remember:
Keep calm.
Drop, cover and hold.
Do not run outside and stay indoors where practical.
Keep away from windows and heavy furniture.
If necessary, evacuate using a previously identified route. Take bags, phones, wallets and emergency supplies.
After the quake, make sure to:
Gather staff together and establish everybody’s condition. After stairs are checked, try to gather workers in one place.
If the building is damaged, turn off water, electricity and gas at mains if safe to do so – conserve your water.
Treat any injuries.
Get in touch with your neighbours – they may need help.
If help is needed, go to your nearest Civil Defence post.
Be extra careful when re-entering buildings after an earthquake:
If you’re a business owner, listen to Civil Defence advice and, when safe, carefully inspect your building’s exterior.
If you’re a worker, wait until your boss tells you it’s safe to go back to work.
If you see cracks, or have the slightest doubt about the safety of the building, get an expert report before going inside.
Once you are cleared to enter the building, be extra vigilant as the contents of the building may have shifted, material may have fallen and there could be unexpected hazards.
If you know there are chemicals or other dangerous materials, make sure to wear PPE and be very careful when going inside.
If a tsunami happens while you’re at work and your business could be affected, remember to:
Go to high ground immediately – know in advance your route to a safe location.
Go at least 1km inland or 35m above sea level. Make sure to leave room for the people behind arriving behind you.
Don’t be tempted to go ‘sightseeing’.
Listen to the radio for information and follow Civil Defence instructions.
In case of a hazardous substance spill:
Raise the alarm.
Evacuate if necessary.
Identify the substance if safe to do so.
Put on PPE.
If safe to do so, close off the source of the spill (eg, secure tops or lids).
Remove sources of ignition if flammable substances are present.
Identify the danger posed by the spill, but only respond if safe to do so.
Refer to the safety data sheet or call an approved handler or other specialist for advice.
If necessary, call emergency services and advise the local council.
Use your spill kit if appropriate and safe to do so.
Prevent the chemical from entering drains or leaving the site.
Dispose of waste safely, as set out in the safety data sheet.
In case of a fire:
Raise the alarm.
Evacuate.
If safe to do so, activate any emergency shutdown systems.
Call 111 and your manager.
If it’s a small fire and it’s safe to do so, use your fire extinguisher; if it’s a large fire, don’t try to extinguish it – retreat to a safe distance and call 111.
Don’t use water on petroleum or electrical fires.
Do not endanger yourself.
Make sure you have an escape route.

A focus of the Health and Safety at Work Act is strengthening worker engagement and participation in health and safety matters
The Act, which was passed on 28 August, sets out two overarching duties for Persons Conducting a Business or Undertaking (PCBU) to involve workers in work health and safety.
The PCBU must:
1.  Engage, so far as is reasonably practicable, with workers who:
Work for its business or undertaking, and;
Are directly affected, or likely to be directly affected, by a health and safety matter of the PCBU, and;
2.  Have effective practices that allow workers who work for its business or undertaking to have an opportunity to participate in improving work health and safety on an ongoing basis. These are known as worker participation practices.
These duties are narrower in scope than the primary duty of care, as they only extend to workers who work for the business or undertaking.
If health and safety representatives (HSRs) and/or health and safety committees (HSCs) are chosen as the PCBU’s effective worker participation practice(s), the Act sets out how they will work, including their functions and powers, and the PCBU’s obligations to provide support.
The Act continues the right for workers to refuse to do unsafe work, and expands protections for workers who raise workplace health and safety matters.
Engagement means talking and listening to your workers. It is particularly valuable at key times, such as identifying hazards and risks, making changes to work that affect health and safety, or developing worker participation practices. Sometimes engagement will be directly with the workers, and sometimes with health and safety representatives.
Worker participation practices provide effective ways for your workers to talk to you about health and safety matters, so that you’re in a better position to manage the risks in your business or undertaking and keep people safe and healthy.
The Act does not specify what types of worker participation practices PCBUs must have. Different types of practices will suit different workplaces; the important thing is that workers can be involved in an effective way.
The objective of worker participation is that all workers can have a say on matters that will affect their health and safety. Effective engagement increases awareness of health and safety and enables staff to work with their PCBU to improve health and safety. PCBUs can make better decisions by drawing on the knowledge and experience of the people who do the job.
Depending on what suits its workplace best, a PCBU could comply with this duty by having HSRs or a HSC – or both. Or they might have neither, and rely on more informal practices instead. These might include regular toolbox talks, having health and safety as a regular agenda item at team meetings, or another feedback mechanism, so staff have a clear way of raising any health and safety concerns with the PCBU. Informal practices like this may well be enough for smaller or low-risk businesses.
The Act contains an exclusion to the requirement for a PCBU to initiate an election for health and safety representatives or set up a health and safety committee if requested by workers – for PCBUs with fewer than 20 workers that are in low risk sectors. The sectors will be defined in new worker participation regulations, which will be available for public feedback shortly.
This exclusion does not stop smaller, non-high risk PCBUs from voluntarily deciding to have health and safety representatives or a committee to meet their worker participation requirements under the Act.
Health and Safety Representatives (HSRs) are workers themselves, not experts in work health and safety. Their job is to represent their fellow workers on health and safety matters.
The Act outlines the provisions that apply if the more formal approach of having HSRs is chosen. The Act clarifies and strengthens HSR functions and powers, subject to checks and balances. The Independent Taskforce on Workplace Health and Safety considered that current HSR default provisions were inappropriate, and HSRs needed sufficient powers, functions and rights to contribute effectively to addressing workplace health and safety matters. The Act’s provisions reflect this, based on the Australian Model Work Health and Safety Act adapted for New Zealand.
Health and Safety Committees (HSCs) bring together workers (including HSRs) and management to assist in the development and review of health and safety policies and procedures for the workplace.
The Act provides that a HSC may be requested by workers, or chosen by the PCBU as an effective way to involve workers in health and safety at the workplace.
When a committee is requested by workers, the PCBU must decide whether to establish one. It can decline this request if it is satisfied existing worker participation practices meet the requirements of the new law. It has to explain why, and advise workers that they may raise the matter under the issue resolution process in the new law.
The Act sets out the functions of HSCs, as well as PCBUs’ corresponding duties to assist HSCs in carrying out their functions.
The Act gives HSRs stronger functions and powers, such as:
Representing workers on health and safety matters.
Making recommendations on health and safety.
Being able to get relevant information and enter and inspect the workplace.
Being able to attend training for their role in paid work time.
The Act requires PCBUs to support HSRs, such as:
Facilitating elections.
Providing information.
Providing time and resources for the HSR role.
The Act gives some powers to HSRs only after they have been trained:
Issuing provisional improvement notices to address a health or safety problem, and
Directing a worker to cease work that would expose them to serious risk arising from an immediate or imminent exposure to a hazard, which supports the existing right for a worker to cease work in this situation.
The Act has checks and balances against improper use of HSR powers, such as:
Limiting the powers to the particular work group that the HSR represents.
Confining the role to health and safety purposes.
Setting some specific limits – eg, on access to information.
Involving the regulator – to help resolve issues, and remove a HSR who is acting for improper purpose.

Workplaces are constantly changing, which is why it’s important for health and safety to be embedded in your company’s culture. Take stock each day to help anticipate any potential hazards that might crop up
It’s inevitable that tools, equipment and parts will deteriorate over time, which increases the likelihood of accidents and failures. Equipment aside, how do you feel today? Being tired, poorly trained or under-supervised can contribute to increased risk and the potential for accidents on site. Here is a helpful list of questions to ask yourself at the beginning of each work day:
There is always a drive to just get stuck in and get the job done. That can lead to workers improvising with tools that aren’t cut out for the job at hand.
Pre-start inspections play a critical role in identifying that the chosen tool is fit for purpose, is in good working order and meets or exceeds ASNZ standards.
Tagging and testing, including correct working practices, are essential, as is wearing the right personal protective equipment at all times. Remember, always use a residual current device (RCD).
When you turned up to work today, did you identify any environmental changes compared to yesterday? Where a hazard can’t be eliminated, it must be isolated or minimised.
Did it rain overnight? This may mean that the ground is slippery. Could the rain have gotten into any electrical equipment? Could items have moved since you were last there, creating new hazards? Are trenches or underground services free of water?
Sometimes you may be the biggest risk at work. Consider the things going on in your life. Did you have a fight with your partner? Did you get enough sleep? Have you had enough to eat? Did you have too much to drink last night?
Factors like these could easily take your head out of the game and cause problems. You must look after yourself and others at all times while on the job.
Work areas can easily become a dumping ground for rubbish and tools. Proper housekeeping can help keep on top of this, making the work area safer. It also makes finding things easier. Slips, trips and falls onsite contribute to a large number of serious harm injuries.
In many cases, workers might have been trained and, on paper, qualified to carry out a task. But training is sometimes in the form of a demonstration and because we all learn in different ways, hands-on supervision until staff are competent is often the best method.
Inducting people to your site is an important step when anyone visits your site. Employees, inspectors or potential buyers must all be made aware of the site-specific hazards and the relevant personal protective equipment required. No one is exempt from this, which includes management when they come to ‘kick the tyres’.
Everyone on site, every day, must actively participate in your company’s health and safety culture to ensure the safest workplace possible.

Every day PlaceMakers delivers frames and trusses to building sites across the country. We want to ensure our customers, and our staff, are kept safe during drop-offs
Many new builds involve significant amounts of work carried out at height. Given the high potential for serious injuries or death, it’s important that appropriate controls are put in place for all workers. This includes anyone working at height during deliveries, and when placing product at height.
As the required controls for work at height become more common across building sites, managers are finding that productivity is increasing across the whole build process. Appropriate planning is key to ensuring that fall protection is in place, before commencing any work at height.
PlaceMakers requests that, whenever a delivery is made to a site where the load needs to be placed on frames or similar, that a safe means of access to unlatch the load is provided.
It’s important that when loads are placed at height, the driver, or other designated person, is able to loosen it safely.
Note: it is a requirement that the person in control of a site notifies WorkSafe at least 24 hours in advance of any work where there is a risk of someone falling five metres or more, regardless of the details of the work.
PlaceMakers is dedicated to ensuring that its drivers are not exposed to unnecessary risk at work. As such, it is PlaceMakers policy that all drivers have the right to a safe working environment, and they have the legal right to decline unsafe work. This includes situations where they’ve been asked to work at height, and are unable to do so safely.
When a driver arrives on site, and no safe means of load loosing is in place, they’ll return it to the place of origin, unless instructed to leave it at ground level.
This also applies where no one is present on site, and no method is in place for the driver to access the site and loosen the load.
There are many methods to control the risks and hazards associated with working at height. These include:
Scaffolding.
Safety nets.
Elevated work platforms.
Fall bags.
Fall arrest harness systems.
The system used will depend on the nature of the work being carried out.
It’s important to note that the first priority must be to prevent the fall. If that isn’t practical, methods for minimising the harm from the fall should be employed.
PlaceMakers can help source and supply many different types of fall protection; your account manager can help with any queries.
For further information, please refer to WorkSafe Working at Height guidelines on www.business.govt.nz/worksafe , or contact your account manager.

When you’ve got lots of jobs on the go, it can be tempting to push through and work longer hours. However, ignoring the signs of fatigue in yourself and your workers can be hazardous. Here are some handy tips from the team at Site Safe to help you stay safe and on top of the job.
Fatigue is more than feeling drowsy. At work, fatigue is a state of exhaustion which can be both mental and physical. It reduces a person’s ability to do their job safely, and decreases performance and productivity.
Fatigue is often caused by a number of combined factors, including:
The demands of work
Work scheduling and planning
Environmental conditions
Dehydration: symptoms of which include cracked lips, flushed face, dizziness, cramps or headaches)
Drugs/alcohol/medication
The type of work activity: such as a noisy environment or using vibrating tools
Poor diet, a lack of exercise, disrupted sleep
Poor emotional wellbeing or stress
Identifying the risk of fatigue
To figure out if fatigue could be a hazard at your work, it’s vital to observe mood, alertness, sleepiness, task performance and focus (see Figure 1).
To assess the fatigue risk, ask yourself and record:
Who is likely to be at risk of fatigue and where?
How often is fatigue likely to occur?
What degree of harm could it cause?
Are any existing control measures effective?
What action should be taken to control and monitor the risk of fatigue in yourself and others?
How urgently is the control needed?
Figure .1
Work scheduling and planning:
Take regular breaks and consider extra breaks if the work is demanding.
If you need to work longer hours, consider staggered start and finish times, and longer breaks and periods off work.
Think about how you schedule your work. For most people, low points in alertness occur between 3.00am and 5.00am, and between 3.00pm and 5.00pm. During these times, try to avoid doing tricky or dangerous jobs.
Monitor and place limits around overtime. Avoid incentives to work too many hours. Limit the number of night shifts in a row that your employees can work. Also place limits around shift swapping and on-call duties – regular sleeping patterns help prevent fatigue.
Try to create a positive environment with good relationships.
Mental and physical demands of work:
Use the right tools and resources for the job.
Use low-vibration hand-held tools and where practical install low-vibration seats in machinery.
Rotate tasks between workers.
Stay hydrated and avoid drinks with caffeine.
Make sure workloads and deadlines are realistic.
Environmental conditions:
Avoid working during extreme heat or cold.
Provide shelter and facilities for breaks.
How much sleep do I need?
Aim for 7.5 to 8.5 hours a night. But to work out your optimal sleep time, try the following on your next holiday:
Put your alarm clock away and wake up naturally for at least two days to overcome cumulative sleep loss.
Then for the next three or four days, write down how many hours you sleep.
Divide the total number of hours you have slept by the number of days – this is how much sleep you need to maintain optimal alertness, performance and wellbeing.
Get the whole team on board
Develop a fatigue policy which includes details on the maximum shift length, average weekly hours, and travel time. Make sure everyone is aware of the policy, how to recognise fatigue and how to report risks and incidents.

Cement-based concrete is widely used and contains extremely aggressive and hazardous chemicals. However, often not enough thought is given to the potential harm it can do to those laying it
Concrete must be managed properly, or it can cause the following health risks.
Concrete burns
Wet concrete is a strong alkaline chemical solution which is very hazardous to skin tissue. Victims are often unaware even after several hours that they are being burnt because alkaline chemicals damage nerve endings first. Concrete burn injuries are extremely painful and can take months to heal. Some treatments can require surgical treatment in the form of skin grafts. In extreme cases, the medical complications associated with the burn may lead to amputation or even death.
Irritant contact dermatitis
Irritant contact dermatitis is a skin condition caused by the chemicals that make up concrete. The particles that make up cement are abrasive and can injure the skin. If the skin is not given sufficient time to recover, irritant dermatitis can develop. This condition is found in many concrete workers.
Symptoms include:
Stinging
Itching
Redness
Swelling
Cracking
Blisters
Scaling
Fissures
Bleeding
Cuts or wounds heal very slowly and infections are likely.
Allergic contact dermatitis
Allergic contact dermatitis is a skin condition caused by an allergic reaction to concrete. Cement-based concrete contains hexavalent chromium which causes allergies and, in some cases, cancer. The cumulative effect of daily exposure may take years to cause a reaction; however, when it does, it is irreversible. Allergic contact dermatitis is a common reason that concrete workers leave the industry.
Symptoms include:
Swelling
Redness
Oozing
Cracking
Stinging
Itching
Blisters
Scaling
Silicosis and COPD
Silicosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) can develop through exposure to cement containing silica dust.
There are various methods for reducing dust on the worksite and preventing exposure to it on the SiteSafe website under the category of ‘Dust’.
Control concrete risks
To control concrete risks, consider the following easy methods:
Personal protective equipment (PPE)
Reduce the risk of skin contact by wearing:
Full-length overalls with long sleeves and trouser legs that won’t let dust or water in.
Waterproof boots.
Waterproof gloves.
Eye protection.
Any clothing that has been contaminated by concrete should be washed before it is used again. Do not allow contaminated clothing to touch skin directly.
Hygiene
Dermatitis can occur without skin being in contact with concrete contamination, so it is vital that workers wash their hands before visiting the toilet and eating. The best solution is to provide a large sink – big enough for workers to submerge their forearms in – with warm water, soap and clean towels to get the concrete off. If running water is not an option, the next best alternative is to store clean water in your work vehicle. Avoid using abrasive cleaning products or alcohol wet wipes as they can damage the skin and increase the risk of injury – a mild soap is best.
Health monitoring
Ensure all workers that may be exposed to concrete understand the risks and necessary precautions to take. It’s recommended you get professionals to conduct regular skin exams and encourage workers to check themselves for signs and symptoms of concrete skin contact dermatitis.
Wastewater
Wastewater produced when working with concrete is toxic. It takes one million litres of water to dilute one litre of alkaline back to a safe pH level (between six and seven). Use these four steps to ensure run-off doesn’t pollute waterways, potentially killing fish and plants:
Check the weather and pick a dry day.
Contain the wastewater by making a bunded area.
Capture the wastewater in the bunded area.
Clear the wastewater by pumping it into a container like a 1000 litre cube.
Emergency action for concrete burns
If there is any suspicion that a concrete burn has occurred, seek help from emergency services.

Putting safety at the heart of planning a project can make life easier in all sorts of ways
The concept of safety in design is easy, but it isn’t used all the time. For instance, in one NZ city, road signs have been installed above a busy motorway. If they go offline, the way to re-set them is to climb onto the signs, up above the motorway, and carry out whatever technical wizardry is required.
Site Safe has created a free, downloadable Safety in Design document to make sure people think about the safety implications of how things go together and consider ways to make it easier to service the building or plant during its lifetime.
The guide focuses strongly on the construction industry and combines practical advice along with a solid theoretical basis for the practice of safe design.
Site Safe chief executive Brett Murray says the concept of safety in design has become important in the past ten years, particularly since the introduction of the Health and safety at Work Act 2015.
“There now has to be thought given to those people working in a built-up environment and how people interact with plant and machinery.”
Mr Murray previously worked at WorkSafe and says he’s seen too many examples where poorly thought-out designs lead directly to injuries or deaths.
“For instance, many of Wellington’s buildings require the use of abseilers to wash windows but the lack of thought in the design of some buildings in terms of safe abseiling anchor points is a problem. This was highlighted a few years ago when an abseiler fell when an anchor screw popped out of the building.”
Mr Murray said that by thinking through all the issues of how something is going to be used, and sometimes misused, designers can reduce risk factors for workers. However, it isn’t just life-threatening situations where smart planning and design helps.
“Good design is things such as avoiding installing circuit boards in tight spaces so that when electricians are doing maintenance they’re not really difficult to access.”
Blake Kyle, a research and technical advisor at Site Safe, says the guide has been developed and reviewed by industry experts to make sure it offers practical advice.
“Many risks to construction workers can be eliminated in the design stage of a project,” he says.
The guide also takes a philosophical look at where design fits into safety.
“The information now available around safety in design has been broadened to include the concept of Whole Life Project Costs. These include consideration of all costs involved in a project from conception, planning, tendering, construction, maintenance, use and right through to demolition.”
Mr Blake says this helps designers meet their legal duties as a Person Conducting a Business or Undertaking (PCBU) to ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, a project is designed without risks to the health and safety of construction workers, users, maintenance workers etc.
Chartered civil engineer Jeremy Eldridge got involved in the Safety in Design project though his links to Constructing Excellence in New Zealand, which aims to enhance the delivery of construction projects.
He has worked in New Zealand, Hong Kong and the UK over several decades and has seen the growing importance of embedding health and safety into the design of projects.
“It incorporates the collected views and comments of many people and I think it is valuable to bring a consistency of approach to safety in design across New Zealand.”
The document also received praise from Dunedin architectural designer Reece Warnock, who is a director on the board for Architectural Designers New Zealand (ADNZ), which helped review the publication.
“It has a very handy, step-by-step process as to how we should be doing risk assessment and what we should be doing while designing,” Mr Warnock said. “It is a good reminder to everyone in the trade what our responsibilities are.”
He says good safety in design is where designers can make the most difference to the outcome over the whole life of a project.
Site Safe attributed several people who contributed to the creation of the publication, including Marcellus Lilley of Studio Pacific Architecture, Chloe Stewart-Tyson and Ian Fenemore of Beca, Nathan Moher of ADNZ, Kirsty Allen of WorkSafe and Adam Thorndon of Dunning Thornton Consultants.

New agency plans to offer a range of initiatives to promote and encourage health and safety in the construction industry.
W orkSafe New Zealand is open for business, with a strong focus on high-risk sectors including construction.
A handful of industries – forestry, construction, agriculture, manufacturing and fishing – account for more than half of the annual death and injury rates in New Zealand. These are among WorkSafe NZ’s top priority areas.
Ensuring a safe Canterbury rebuild is another priority focus.
As WorkSafe NZ Board Chair, Professor Gregor Coster, points out, in New Zealand (population 4.5 million) an average of 75 people die at work a year. By comparison, in the UK, with a population of 70 million that figure is 170.
In addition to the death and injury rate, a further 600 to 900 Kiwis die of work-related diseases or illnesses annually. About 170 of these deaths each year are asbestos-related. Other deaths are from cancers and cardiovascular and respiratory diseases caused by workplace exposures.
“New Zealand is losing far more people per head of population than other first-world countries,” says Professor Coster.
WorkSafe NZ officially began on 16 December 2013 as a stand-alone Crown Agency with a focus on transforming workplace health and safety attitudes and performance.
Its establishment was one of the key recommendations of the Independent Taskforce on Workplace Health and Safety, which was itself a response in part to the 2010 Pike River mine tragedy in which 29 men died. Pike River laid bare the fact that New Zealand has long had a very poor record on workplace health and safety.
Professor Coster says WorkSafe NZ has the mandate and the resources to play its critical role in ensuring workers in New Zealand come home healthy and safe every day.
“For the first time in recent history, the workplace health and safety regulator is properly funded, high on the Government’s agenda, and breaking into the consciousness of more and more Kiwis,” he says.
“It is not our task alone. Every worker, every union, every health and safety advisor, every manager and every employer has a role to play.
“While we are committed to a collaborative approach, WorkSafe NZ as the health and safety regulator will enforce strongly where it has to.
“We have an unprecedented opportunity to make a real difference.”
Several of WorkSafe NZ’s priority areas come together in Canterbury, where the construction and infrastructure-related rebuild is on an unprecedented scale.
“It is critical that the Canterbury rebuild is safe,” says Professor Coster.
WorkSafe’s Canterbury Rebuild Health and Safety Programme has a dedicated team of inspectors focusing on the greatest risk areas for serious harm. These include proactive site assessments on work involving asbestos, excavations, working at height and mobile plant.
Part of the dedicated inspectorate includes a rotation of experienced inspectors from WorkCover New South Wales, who are seconded to WorkSafe NZ for much of 2014. They provide a high level of expertise and are very experienced in health and safety in construction.
The team is also working on a range of initiatives to benefit construction workers, contractors, employers, principals as well as the construction industry nationwide. Initiatives have included trade breakfasts, information sessions, forums and seminars on high-risk health and safety issues. To date, more than 1,800 people have attended these sessions.
“Our people are there to provide guidance, support and advice – as much of a safety net as possible,” says Professor Coster.
WorkSafe NZ is also delighted at the level of industry buy-in to the Canterbury Rebuild Safety Charter, (www.safetycharter.org.nz). This is a joint partnership with industry leaders and government and, as of December 2013, more than 70 organisations – including major construction and insurance companies – have signed or endorsed the Charter.
“It shows a very strong commitment to health and safety,” says Professor Coster.
“The Charter has ten key actions to help raise standards of safety across the rebuild. Everyone knows what is expected of them and what they have to do to keep themselves and others safe.”
For more information about how to ensure safety compliance on your worksite, visit the new website www.worksafe.govt.nz or call the helpline on 0800 030 040.
WorkSafe NZ regulates and enforces workplace health and safety and energy and gas safety.
WorkSafe NZ took over functions of the Health and Safety Group of the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (previously Department of Labour).
WorkSafe NZ’s total inspectorate resource will increase by more than 65% with core inspectors going from 115 to 200, and high hazards and major facilities inspectors increasing from 6 to 29.
WorkSafe NZ’s annual budget is $80 million, up from Health and Safety Group’s $53 million.
WorkSafe NZ’s Board is comprised of Professor Gregor Coster (Chair), Ross Wilson (Deputy Chair), Paula Rose, Dr Patrick Strange, Don Stock, Chris Ellis and Kerry Prendergast.
Acting Chief Executive is Geoffrey Podger, formerly Chief Executive of the UK Health and Safety Executive (HSE). Gordon MacDonald, who has had a 35-year career with HSE, will become permanent Chief Executive on 17 March 2014.
WorkSafe NZ enforces a number of pieces of legislation including: Health and Safety in Employment Act 1992; Electricity Act 1992; Gas Act 1992; Plumbers Gasfitters and Drainlayers Act 2006.
New draft legislation will be introduced to Parliament early in 2014 to replace the Health and Safety in Employment Act. Among the principle proposed changes is a new definition of responsibility in the workplace. It will be the core duty of a ‘PCBU’ (Person in Charge of a Business or Undertaking) to ensure the health and safety of downstream workers, contractors and subcontractors so far as is ‘reasonably practicable’. There will also be a much greater requirement for PCBUs to consult and support their employees in health and safety matters.
As part of the legislation changes, the asbestos regulations are also being reviewed.

The future of training has arrived with the launch of Site Safe’s first virtual reality (VR) health and safety training courses for New Zealand’s construction industry
Site Safe’s Foundation Passport courses – Building Construction and Civil VR – have been developed in collaboration with the Ministry of Social Development (MSD) and SkillsVR. Extensive industry consultation has also been undertaken to ensure that what is being delivered is what the industry wants to see in a foundational health and safety training course.
During this consultation, Site Safe also found that businesses wanted new and innovative ways to train their workers, including technology driven tools such as online learning and virtual reality.
Driving innovation
Compared to traditional classroom learning, VR training is more time-efficient, cost-effective and accommodating to people with different learning styles. It delivers consistent training content and results in high learning outcomes.
Learners will gain the tools and knowledge to keep themselves and others safe in areas such as working at heights, working in trenches, delivering materials, and laying foundations through an interactive, technology-driven virtual experience.
It also eliminates training risks and verifies competency, as learning outcomes are automatically logged through Learning Records.
“As the industry’s leading safety organisation, we are committed to working alongside industry to make sure our training is the gold standard in giving our kaimahi the knowledge they need to stay safe onsite,” said Site Safe Chief Executive Brett Murray.
“ By utilising technology such as VR, Site Safe continues to lead in providing innovative and effective ways of delivering workplace health and safety training.”
VR health and safety training allows for workers to be fully immersed in and engaged with their learning. Using VR headsets and controllers, learners complete interactive tasks, such as hazard and risk identification, PPE selection, and identifying how to keep themselves and others healthy and safe in a construction environment.
Safe introduction to construction
While VR health and safety training is not designed to replace real-life experiences, it is a safe way to introduce a construction environment to someone without prior experience. The virtual ‘on-the-job’ environment means there are no real-life risks to learners.
Since its launch with MSD in September 2022, more than 1,000 job seekers and learners have completed the VR courses, gaining the knowledge and skills required to keep themselves and others safe on site. Learners also receive a digital Site Safety card, which is valid for two years.
Job seeker Jacob Hedley was the first person to complete the VR Foundation Passport training course. In just one-and-a-half hours, he had achieved his digital Site Safety Card and important skills to assist in his job search.
“I was blown away,” said Hedley. “You can actually go [onto the] site, take a video of whatever that site is and say, ‘this is what we do here’.
“[It] will save managers time in getting someone to induct them.”
One way to fight labour shortages
The development of VR health and safety training is an innovative way of getting people ready for work in the construction industry.
“It is important that we are doing all we can to ensure that construction is seen as a safe and attractive sector to work in,” said Murray.
“Training plays a big part in building the competence and confidence of our workforce to produce good work outcomes.”
Site Safe’s Foundation Passport – Building Construction (VR) and Foundation Passport – Civil (VR) courses are now available to book in Auckland, Wellington, and Christchurch. Visit sitesafe.org.nz to learn more and book now.
Site Safe is a not-for-profit, membership-based organisation that supports a culture of health and safety in New Zealand construction. For more information go to: www.sitesafe.org.nz

Pumping concrete is often required in residential builds and, while builders don’t usually carry out the work themselves, ensuring the site remains safe during the process is everyone’s responsibility.
Pumping is an efficient method of moving and placing concrete, used in the manufacture of pre-cast and tilt-up panels, concrete formwork, slab construction, concrete paving and concrete spraying – and, like any process during a build, safety should be front of mind.
Everyone onsite has a responsibility to ensure safety measures are followed, while employers have obligations under the Health and Safety in Employment Act 1992 (the Act) to prevent harm to employees, contractors and others.
This article provides practical guidance about the health and safety issues of concrete pumping, with guidance for principals, employers, contractors and pump operators (employees or contractors) on how to meet their obligations to provide the safest working environment possible.
An employer has a duty to identify and control hazards, including hazardous manual handling tasks. These tasks must be assessed and, if the potential for serious injury is determined, control measures should be put in place to reduce the likelihood that harm will occur.
Overseas research shows that 5%-10% of construction workers may be sensitised, or allergic, to cement. Exposing the skin to cement can cause both irritant and allergic dermatitis.
Irritant dermatitis occurs because the abrasive and drying nature of cement on the skin causes it to become dry, itchy, red and scaly. Allergic dermatitis is caused by a person becoming allergic to a chemical component in the cement, usually chromium salts. This usually occurs upon skin exposure to wet cement. Repeated exposure to cement can lead to allergic contact dermatitis.
The more often the person is exposed, the worse the dermatitis becomes.
Those affected may have to leave the industry, if the condition becomes serious.
The symptoms of dermatitis usually show within 24-48 hours of cement exposure.
” Overseas research shows that 5%-10% of construction workers may be sensitised, or allergic to cement
Depending on the severity of exposure, symptoms include:
A red rash or bumps on the exposed skin.
Itching, sometimes severe.
Dry, cracked, red patches resembling a burn.
Blisters that drain fluid or become crusted.
Pain, tenderness or heat on the exposed skin.
Scaly, raw or thickened lesions.
Some components or additives in the cement are classified as hazardous substances. This means that the cement supplier has to provide the person in charge of the place of work with safety data sheets. Safety data sheets contain useful information on how to keep safe when handling the concrete, what to -do if an emergency occurs or if significant health reactions occur.
Wet cement can cause burns, if trapped against the skin. Personal protective clothing or equipment such as gloves or boots must not allow wet cement to be held against the skin.
However, if this occurs, it is important to immediately wash the area with soap and water to remove cement from the skin.
Wear appropriate protective clothing and equipment: gloves, safety goggles (if splashes to the face could occur), long clothing, waterproof footwear.
Remove footwear/clothing immediately and wash skin with a pH-neutral soap and water if direct contact with concrete occurs.
If the symptoms of dermatitis appear, see a doctor as soon as possible for treatment.
This is an excerpt from MBIE’s Concrete Pumping Health and Safety Guidelines , which provides practical advice about the safe operation and maintenance of concrete pumping equipment. The emphasis is to ensure a safe working environment whenever this equipment is used.
They are not intended to be an all-encompassing design, maintenance and operation manual. This information is available in manufacturers’ operating manuals.
This document is based on the current knowledge of construction methods within the industry, and is not intended to exclude other methods or processes that can be shown to meet the requirements of providing a safe workplace under the Act.
The guidelines were prepared by a committee of representatives from the Concrete Pumping Association of New Zealand (CPANZ) and underwent a public consultation process. This resulted in submissions from a range of affected parties, including the self-employed, employers and employees within the industry.
Consultation with the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment ensured overall compatibility with occupational health and safety legislation and technical alignment with standards.

A recent Employment Relations Authority (ERA) decision highlighted employers’ obligations around providing staff with appropriate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
A dispute over a pair of steelcapped safety shoes cost a Christchurch-based company more than $10,000, after the ERA determined it failed to meet its regulatory obligations to provide a former employee with suitable PPE – making his dismissal unjustifiable.
The employee was told that his safety shoes – which were held together by tape with the steel caps exposed – needed replacing. The company’s policy was for staff to purchase safety shoes worth up to $70 on a company account.
However, the cheapest pair of shoes available exceeded this value and the employee also required a more expensive pair of boots for ankle support as a result of previous injuries. As he couldn’t afford to make up the shortfall, he continued to use his worn-out shoes.
After receiving three separate on-site warnings about his footwear, he was asked to attend a disciplinary meeting, which he did without a support person.
A week later, he received a dismissal letter; the reason given was:
“You are dismissed because you knowingly continued to work on construction sites, installing insulation without adequate PPE…”
While the ERA acknowledged the employee could have done more (reducing his compensation by 20% as a result) to ensure his damaged footwear was replaced, it found ultimately that the company was negligent for not taking direct steps to supply him with new safety shoes.
As a result of this, and for not following correct processes, the ERA ordered the company to pay the former employee $9,600 plus three month’s wages (minus 20%).
What does this mean for me?
The lesson for employers is that it is your responsibility to ensure your staff have the correct PPE for the job, and to provide it for them when they do not.
In its Guidance to the Health and Safety at Work (General Risk and Workplace Management) Regulations 2016, WorkSafe highlights that a person conducting a business or undertaking (PCBU) carrying out work at a workplace must ensure that:
a) They, or another PCBU, have provided workers with PPE appropriate to the job and
b) They, so far as reasonably practicable, ensure that workers use or wear the PPE provided to them.
The following example from the guidance illustrates those duties:
“To prevent eye injuries, the PCBU of a welding workshop provided its welders safety glasses to wear under their welding helmets. However, even after being instructed by the PCBU to always wear the safety glasses while welding, one worker regularly removed them.
“As the PCBU must ensure workers wear PPE so far as is reasonably practicable, the PCBU talked to the worker to find out why he removed his safety glasses. The worker told the PCBU that it was because wearing the safety glasses over the worker’s prescription glasses caused him discomfort. The PCBU then worked with the worker to find safety glasses that the worker could wear without discomfort.”
What else do i need to know?
The PPE provided by employers must be compatible with any other safety equipment or clothing required for the job, fit correctly and comfortably, and be suitable for the nature of the work.
Employers also have a duty to ensure that workers’ PPE is maintained properly and replaced when necessary. Proper training on use and maintenance should also be provided to workers.
On the other side of the equation, workers are responsible for ensuring they use PPE in line with the information and training given to them by the PCBU.
They also must not intentionally damage safety equipment, and they must tell the PCBU when PPE needs to be cleaned, decontaminated or has been damaged.
Are there any exceptions?
The only exception to the provision to providing workers with PPE is when the worker ‘genuinely and voluntarily chooses to provide their own’. In these cases, the PCBU must be satisfied the gear is appropriate and meets all necessary regulations.
It is important to note that workers may change their minds about this at any time; however, they must give appropriate notice if they wish the PCBU to begin supplying their PPE.

Pumping concrete is often required in residential builds and, while builders don’t usually carry out the work themselves, ensuring the site remains safe during the process is everyone’s responsibility.
Pumping is an efficient method of moving and placing concrete, used in the manufacture of pre-cast and tilt-up panels, concrete formwork, slab construction, concrete paving and concrete spraying – and, like any process during a build, safety should be front of mind.
Everyone onsite has a responsibility to ensure safety measures are followed, while employers have obligations under the Health and Safety in Employment Act 1992 (the Act) to prevent harm to employees, contractors and others.
This article provides practical guidance about the health and safety issues of concrete pumping, with guidance for principals, employers, contractors and pump operators (employees or contractors) on how to meet their obligations to provide the safest working environment possible.
If a concrete placing boom is set up near aerial power lines, the principal and concrete pumping contractors should take all practicable steps to ensure workers are not harmed by the significant hazards faced when working near high-voltage electricity.
These include electrocution from direct contact with the lines, or arc flash, where a flashover of electric current leaves its intended path and travels through the air to another conductor or the ground.
All practicable steps should be taken to eliminate the hazard by de-energising the power lines. Please note that the line owner will require a reasonable period of notice for this to be arranged.
If it not practicable to de-energise the power line, principals and concrete pumping contractors must ensure, during all stages of the concrete pumping operation, that no part of the concrete placing boom comes within FOUR METRES of live power lines, unless the operator has received written consent from the line owner allowing a reduced distance.
Reasonable notice should be provided for written applications for consent to work within reduced minimum approach distances or to turn the power off to the area. If approval to work closer to overhead power lines has been obtained in writing, the minimum approach distance between a power line and any mobile plant (in this case, the concrete placing vehicle) shall not be less than specified in Table 1.
Consent from the power line owner shall also include:
The section of power line to which the consent applies.
Any other reasonable conditions to be observed when working in proximity to or above the power line.
If the operator of any mobile plant is a competent person working in, or in the proximity of, an overhead power line, the approach distances may be reduced in accordance with the safety practices determined by the overhead power line owner.
It is recommended in these cases that the mobile plant operator is assisted by a spotter, who can determine the machine’s proximity to the power lines.
“When considering minimum approach distances, take into account the surge action of the concrete pump boom when it is pumping
If concrete placing booms or other mobile plant are likely to be used at any time in the proximity of overhead power lines, the owner or operator of the plant should affix an approved warning notice in a conspicuous place as near as practicable to the operator’s position. The notice shall be maintained in a legible condition and shall state: “WARNING: KEEP CLEAR OF POWER LINES”
When considering minimum approach distances, take into account the surge action of the concrete pump boom when it is pumping. This action has resulted in serious harm and fatal accidents through contact with electrical conductors.
For further information on safe distances when working in the vicinity of overhead power lines, refer to the New Zealand Electrical Code of Practice for Electrical Safe Distances NZECP 34:2001, available from the Energy Safety Service of the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (Economic Development). Website: www.med.govt.nz .
It is recommended that concrete pumping companies engage proactively with the power line companies in order to ensure a viable and efficient working partnership.

Site Safe follows up last month’s article on scissor lifts by looking at some common questions about scaffolding
One of the most common queries Site Safe receives is whether people need training to set up a low-level scaffold under five metres in height.
Everyone involved in the scaffolding process must have the knowledge and skills to perform the work safely, regardless of the height of the scaffold. You’ll also need the right certification, depending on the situation. Anyone involved in setting up, dismantling or changing any scaffold should have:
The ability to make simple calculations (eg, working out a load).
The ability to read and understand suppliers’ information, general site plans, design drawings and scaffold specifications.
Thorough knowledge of the scaffolding equipment they’re using.
Thorough knowledge of the assembly methods and design requirements associated with the scaffolding equipment they’re using.
The ability to identify the common hazards of scaffolding work and take effective precautions to control associated risks.
Competency to visually inspect scaffolding equipment for faults.
The physical skills needed for scaffolding construction.
Competency in manual lifting techniques.
The ability to work safely and confidently at heights.
The ability to use scaffolding tools and equipment correctly.
The ability to erect and dismantle scaffolding in the correct sequence.
Knowledge of the prevention of falling objects.
To set up a scaffold under five metres, you must be a ‘competent person’. Being competent means you have the knowledge and skills to carry out a particular task.
This experience could be gained through training, qualifications, experience or a combination of all of these. Be aware that the five metres is measured from the highest part of the scaffold to the ground.
For putting up scaffold above five metres, you’ll need the appropriate Certificate of Competence for the type of scaffold you’re working on. Certificates of Competence are issued by SARNZ (Scaffolding, Access and Rigging Association of New Zealand) and are valid for four years.
Site Safe is a not-for-profit, membership-based organisation that promotes, inspires and supports a culture of health and safety in New Zealand construction.

When completing and issuing Records of Work (RoWs), Licensed Building Practitioners (LBPs) have certain obligations
T h e Building Practitioners Board (the Board) continues to receive a high number of complaints about LBPs not issuing RoWs when they are required. Not providing an RoW is a poor reason to come before the Board, so please ensure your records are up to date.
You can read more information on how RoWs should be used in ‘ Know your stuff: For the record ’ which was in Codewords 71 from March 2016.
What are the rules?
Each LBP, who carries out or supervises restricted building work (RBW), must, on completion of the RBW, provide an RoW to the homeowner and territorial authority (the local council). This requirement is set out in section 88 of the Building Act. It is also a disciplinary matter for LBPs if an RoW is not provided when one is required – meaning that you could be disciplined by the Board.
What is a RoW for? An RoW is designed to be a documented record of who carried out or supervised RBW under a building consent.
It protects you by listing only what you did, removing future uncertainly in situations where multiple contractors have performed or supervised RBW on one site. For this reason, the accuracy of the record is important, as it will remain with the building records for the life of the building. It serves as an enduring and accurate record of RBW undertaken onsite.
If you were asked today what work you carried out on a project 12 years ago, would you be able to accurately describe that work?
How does this play out in practice?
When you have completed your portion of RBW onsite, you should:
Complete an RoW. If you do not have the RoW template, you may download it from our website HERE.
Ensure the record is sufficiently detailed, so it describes each aspect of the RBW you either carried out or supervised (your role could include a combination of supervision and doing work).
Provide a copy of the RoW to both the homeowner and to the local council.
What if I don’t provide a RoW?
You could face disciplinary action by the Board if you do not provide an RoW when one is required. You must not withhold an RoW for non-payment of work under a building contract or simply because you are in dispute with the client. Failure to provide an RoW is a disciplinary matter for which the Board has zero tolerance.
For a more detailed overview of these requirements, refer to the Board’s decision on the LBP website:
https://www.lbp.govt.nz/complaints-and-past-decisions/past-complaint-decisions/complaint-c2-01170-penalty/
Subcontractors and employed LBPs
Whether an LBP is a subcontractor or is employed, they are still accountable to the Board. The Board does not deal with payment or contractual disputes but determines whether the LBP has met their obligations under the Building Act.
Not knowing the owner’s name is not a defence for failing to provide an RoW, as there are ways of finding out such details. It is also important to remember who the RoW is for. While it might be a common practice to give it to the main contractor, it is a practice that carries the risk that it may not be passed onto those that require it — the owner and the local council.
A recent Board disciplinary decision found that the above are not good reasons for failure to provide an RoW. The respondent was fined $1,000 and ordered to pay costs of $500, even though he had given the RoW to the main contractor, who then failed to pass it on.

The Building Practitioners Board recently concluded an investigation, which demonstrated the limitations of clause 3A of Schedule 1 of the Building Act
T he Board’s investigation looked at whether a building consent should have been obtained for a salon to be constructed at the complainant’s address before building work was carried out. This required the Board to determine whether an exemption under clause 3A of Schedule 1 applied, specifically an exemption for certain standalone buildings up to 30sqm.
The respondent knew that a business was to be conducted from the salon but believed that a building consent was not required because it was an outbuilding between 10 and 30sqm being constructed by a Licensed Building Practitioner (LBP) and came within the provisions of clause 3A of Schedule 1.
Section 40 Building Act 2004
Section 40 requires that all building work must be carried out in accordance with a building consent. The process of issuing a building consent and the subsequent inspections under it ensure independent verification that the works meet the performance requirements of the Building Code. In doing so, the building consent process provides protection for owners of works, and the public.
There are limited exceptions to this requirement, one of which is building work described in Schedule 1 of the Building Act.
Schedule 1, Building Act
Schedule 1 of the Building Act includes a list of building work which is exempted from requiring a building consent. The exception being relied on in this instance was clause 3A.
This clause allows for a detached building exceeding 10sqm but not exceeding 30sqm in floor area and constructed of lightweight building products to be built without a building consent, with some limitations. These limitations include certain requirements in relation to building height and height in relation to a boundary or to another residential building. It is also not allowed to contain sanitary or cooking facilities or facilities for the storage of potable water and cannot include sleeping accommodation unless the building is used in connection with a dwelling. If it is used for sleeping, it must have smoke alarms installed.
The Board investigation
Each element of an exemption must be satisfied for it to apply to the building work. In this case the height, area, and products used were satisfied, and the sleeping accommodation and smoke alarm issues were not relevant as the intended use was a salon.
That left clause 3A (1)(d) – does not contain sanitary facilities or facilities for the storage of potable water. The salon included sanitary facilities, and the respondent was aware of this – his quote included the supply of a shower base, a vanity and a kitchenette unit.
The Council issued a Notice to Fix recording that as a bathroom, along with the associated plumbing and drainage works had been installed, a building consent was necessary. On this basis, the exemption was not available.
The Council also noted in the Notice to Fix that the building was closer than the measure of its own height to the existing residential building (clause 3A (2)). Again, this means that the exemption was not available.
Finally, correspondence from the Council noted that because members of the public would be using the building if it was a salon, under s363 of the Building Act, a building consent was necessary
The respondent’s response
The respondent stated that because he was not going to carry out the plumbing work, he did not have to make sure a building consent was in place before the building work was carried out. In essence, his defence was that a building consent would have to be obtained when plumbing work was carried out.
The finding of the Board
If the respondent’s view was correct, then some form of retrospective building consent would have to be granted for the work that had already been completed. The Building Act does not provide for retrospective building consents. Rather, it provisions for Certificates of Acceptance, which are an alternative to a Code Compliance Certificate, and which note unconsented work without providing an assurance that the building work meets Building Code requirements.
The Board does not accept that an LBP can segment the whole of an intended build and form the view that, if they do some, but not all the work, they need not ensure a building consent is in place.
Further, the Board considers that an LBP should know of and correctly apply the exemptions in Schedule 1, or if there is any doubt, at least seek further professional advice or a written acknowledgment from a Building Consent Authority that an exemption does apply.

T wisted wire ties are one reason many brick veneer houses failed in past earthquakes, such as in Napier in 1931. However, modern clay brick veneer construction on timber-framed and steel-framed houses generally performed well when subjected to earthquake shaking in Canterbury.
These effects were replicated in BRANZ’s research centre and the results indicated that modern construction details performed well.
Even when the building was distorted well beyond this level of earthquake, damage was far less than expected; there was severe cracking occurring, but with only a few bricks falling away.
Most of the damage in Canterbury associated with brick veneer construction was attributable to ground movement/damage, particularly affecting concrete bricks or older veneer construction, or to poor installation.
There have been concerns that mortar properties are not controlled adequately and therefore contribute to poor earthquake performance. NZS 4210 masonry construction has a strength requirement for structural masonry but not for brick veneer, stating only that mortars for veneers shall follow the strength requirements of masonry suppliers.
However, a minimum strength is required to facilitate good structural and durability performance. Research opinion indicates that this should be at least 6MPa and this can be achieved with mortar mixes of 4:1 sand to cement by volume.
In the Canterbury earthquakes brick veneer failures occurred due to lack of bond between the brick and the mortar because the mortar that had been applied was too dry.
NZS 4210 states that the bond between brick and mortar is the most important single factor affecting brick veneer strength. Recent testing at BRANZ has confirmed this to be the case. Refer to BUILD 127 Dec 2011/Jan 2012, “Brick Veneer stands the test” by Stuart Thurston.
The BRANZ test also confirmed practices that improve bond strength, including:
Wetting bricks before they are laid.
Having enough water to get adequate mortar flow.
Pressing and tapping the bricks to firmly embed them in the mortar.
Not dislodging or disturbing the bricks once they are placed.
Minimising the time between spreading mortar, placing the bricks and tooling the mortar joints
Adequately curing the freshly constructed veneer particularly in hot, dry weather.
The BRANZ testing found that the most important factor to ensure good bond performance is that the mixed mortar contains sufficient water and has an adequate flow rate. This means it should have as much water as the bricklayer can easily handle without any free water forming in the mixing barrow.
Modern clay bricks are manufactured with vertical core holes to reduce weight. The dowelling effect of hardened mortar in these vertical core holes increases the strength of veneer walls. Also because the practice of nailing ties to timber framing has been replaced with the modern screw fixing practice, bricks are no longer disturbed in the mortar by hammering.
BRANZ testing has also shown that it is not necessary to wet bed brick veneer ties, as the performance of brick veneer walls where ties have been dry bedded is acceptable.
Mortar mixes for external brick veneer are specified in NZS 4210 for sea spray areas and for other exposures. Those opting for a stronger mortar and a more consistent mortar mix may use proprietary bagged mortar, where the mix proportions are more accurately controlled under factory conditions.

Skills maintenance workshops will help builders navigate the industry’s ongoing changes
With consumer protection measures now in place, PlaceMakers is pleased to announce its eighth round of seminars, which will help builders define their new responsibilities in light of the new legislation.
“The recently released guidance highlighted some specifics that weren’t previously discussed – such as a homeowner’s right to request a disclosure statement, even if the total cost is under $30,000, and the requirement to include materials in the amount. We’ll make sure to identify and discuss those points of difference,” says presenter John Tait.
John will cover all aspects of the consumer protection measures, including contractual agreements, disclosure statements, warranties, guarantees and maintenance information.
The seminars will also look at Building Code Clause B1 Structure. John will run through how load paths are managed in truss design and NZS 3604 .
“There have been numerous situations in New Zealand, where loads weren’t transferred through to the foundations, or where builders have been using incorrect materials or methods to install structural connections which resist forces such as uplift,” says John.
“One of the most important responsibilities for any building contractor at the moment is to stay up to speed, understand the changes happening around them and pass the correct information onto their team members.”
Don’t miss out on the well-researched information presented in these seminars! Contact your local PlaceMakers to register your interest and build on the skills maintenance points you’ve already earned through Under Construction .

Statutory liability insurance is designed to protect businesses from accidental breaches of the law and can provide cover to builders who inadvertently harm the environment
In 2013, thousands of litres of diesel leaked from a faulty storage tank into a nearby stream, contaminating the water supply of the nearby town of Raetihi. Residents were without water for three weeks.
The company responsible was prosecuted by the regional council under the Resource Management Act and under legislation relating to hazardous substances. It was fined $300,000 and had to spend $125,000 on legal bills.
Another business associated with the leak had to pay more than $50,000 in health and safety fines and WorkSafe New Zealand costs.
In the above example, the fines and legal costs were covered by the respective companies’ statutory liability insurance.
This is designed to protect businesses from fines and penalties, and the associated legal costs, for unintentional breaches of most New Zealand legislation (excluding criminal statutes), including the:
Resource Management Act.
Hazardous Substances and New Organisms Act.
Building Act.
Fair Trading Act.
Health & Safety At Work Act*.
*While the law specifically states that you can’t insure against fines under health and safety legislation, you are able to get insurance for the legal costs of defending an action and for any reparation payments that may be awarded.
Construction site risks
Excavations
In 2014, a builder was fined more than $10,000 for breaching the Resource Management Act in relation to the renovation of two Auckland properties. Workers had dug an open trench with no support on the boundary, and excavations had taken place under the house that left it inadequately supported and at risk of collapse.
The judge said the breaches posed significant risks to the environment, the neighbouring property, the people working under the house and its occupants. Further fines of more than $7,000 were imposed for other offences under the Building Act.
Waterway contamination
Construction sites are also a common source of waterway contamination, through uncontained site run off during heavy rain or when pollutants such as paint, sealants, solvents and glues enter storm water systems.
Waste
Dumping of construction waste, land contaminated by seepage, silica dust from concrete-cutting, and other airborne contaminants have the potential to breach both health and safety and environmental protection law and trigger prosecution.
Under the Resource Management Act, which is New Zealand’s primary law for protecting the environment, the most serious offences can incur fines of up to $600,000 for businesses, and up to two years imprisonment or $300,000 in fines for individuals. If the offence continues, a daily fine of up to $10,000 can be imposed.
Examples of offences that could be subject to this level of penalty include:
Using land in contravention of a rule in a district plan.
Subdividing land without a resource consent.
Excavation, reclamation or building without a consent in coastal marine, lake bed or river bed areas.
Discharging contaminants into the environment without a resource consent.
Statutory liability insurance
Builders should have statutory liability insurance to protect them in case of a health and safety prosecution, to cover their own legal bills and any court-ordered reparations awarded to an injured person. It also covers fines imposed for breaching the Building Act.
The same cover will protect builders if they’re found liable for activity at a building site that breaches the Resource Management Act. In this case, it will pay the fines imposed and any associated legal bills.

TITLE   : Tackling tricky flashing

One of the trickiest flashing details to design and construct correctly is a balustrade-to-wall junction flashing. This Codewords article gives a quick overview of this detail and provides some useful tips and other step-by-step information on how to correctly install this type of flashing
The junction where the capping of an enclosed balustrade meets the face of the main exterior wall of a building (typically at the end of a deck) is a high-risk location for weathertightness failure.
Where a metal cap flashing is used along the top of the balustrade, designs to Acceptable Solution E2/AS1 require fabricated metal saddle flashings to make these junctions weathertight.
However, the metal saddle flashings must be positioned correctly to ensure the junctions are weathertight.
Different saddle flashing at front of cavity
Figure 12 of E2/AS1 requires these saddle flashings to be positioned at the front of the cavity (immediately behind the outer cladding) – see NOTE (1) and detail (c) in the drawing. Placing these flashings at the front of the cavity reduces the likelihood of water entering the cavity where the flashing passes through it.
Importantly, this approach is different to most other cavity flashing details provided in E2/AS1 . The narrow width of the balustrade means that only a very small volume of water could enter the cavity of the main wall above, so a different approach is acceptable. Any such water will instead run down to the flexible flashing tape where the sloped packer meets the main wall underlay, then be diverted to the adjacent cavity beside the balustrade, and eventually drain out its base.
Getting it right
E2/AS1 has specific requirements for parapets and enclosed balustrades:
No penetrations are allowed in the top surfaces of parapets and enclosed balustrade walls. Where rails are required on balustrades, they must be side-fixed through the cladding into the framing as per E2/AS1 Figure 19 (on page 58 of the E2/AS1 document).
The sides of cappings must overlap the cladding laps on both sides as per E2/AS1 Table 7 (on page 40) situation 2 or 3:
70mm plus kick-out (or bird’s beak for inside edge of enclosed balustrades as per E2/AS1 Figure 5 on page 38) for low, medium, high and very high wind zones
90mm plus kick-out or bird’s beak for extra high wind zone.
All claddings on parapets and enclosed balustrades must be installed over drained cavities, except vertical corrugated steel
In extra high wind zones, all claddings must be installed over a rigid wall underlay, consisting of minimum 7mm H3 treated plywood or 6mm fibre-cement sheet.
Refer to E2/AS1 for references.
More detail in flashings supplement
BRANZ has published step-by-step diagrams showing the installation sequence for the components to these junctions in their recent Build flashings supplement, which is available on the Build Magazine website.
As with the installation of any flashing, sequencing of installation steps is key to a good outcome. The balustrade-to-wall junction can be found in section 4.5 of BRANZ’s ‘Build flashings supplement’. This key resource provides a comprehensive overview of construction sequencing for most common residential flashing applications, and explains the installation process.

Sometimes LBPs struggle to think of ideas for on-the-job learning, especially if they have been working with the same products and techniques for some time. This article identifies some of the activities that qualify under this category and provides guidance to help determine what else might apply and how best to record it
While learning to use a new product or technique is a great example of on-the job learning, it’s not the only area of knowledge that is relevant.
IDENTIFY ON-THE-JOB LEARNING
LBPs require a range of skills and knowledge to carry out their work effectively. Here are some areas you may wish to consider for skills maintenance:
Regulatory knowledge – knowing your legal responsibilities, applying for building and resource consents, staying up to date with changes to the Building Code, participating in consultations.
Technical knowledge and skills – new products and techniques, putting theoretical knowledge into practice, learning from mistakes, refreshers, looking up standards and other technical guidelines.
Health and safety – learning safer methods of working, participating in site inductions, using new types of PPE or equipment with improved safety features.
Professional skills – managing contracts, liaising with clients, managing resources, supervising workers.
Some LBPs spend less time directly on the tools – for example, if they are undertaking more management or oversight type roles. It is a common misconception that these LBPs will struggle to complete on-the-job learning. LBPs overseeing projects will still need to maintain their regulatory knowledge, manage health and safety on site and hone their professional skills. LBPs working in senior positions often supervise contracts, people and resources on the job. This type of work is relevant to their LBP professional skills and can be used for on-the-job learning examples.
ELECTIVE ACTIVITIES VERSUS ON-THE-JOB LEARNING
Sometimes it is less clear if learning should be classified as an elective activity or on-the-job learning if it was completed while at work. For example, you might take a first aid course as part of your employment. The on-the-job learning component of skills maintenance is designed to capture learning that doesn’t fit under an elective learning activity, as it occurs organically while you are on the job. A good rule of thumb is to consider listing the learning as an elective activity first, and then if it doesn’t fit, consider including it as on-the-job learning. For example, a first aid course is structured training, so it would fit as an elective activity.
RECORD YOUR LEARNING
To record your on-the-job learning, you don’t need to write a whole essay, but you do need more than one sentence. For MBIE to understand the value of what you are recording, you need to briefly cover the following:
Summary of the project or job and your role.
What you learned.
How this will improve your ability to work as an LBP.
You can also attach any relevant documents, such as plans, photos, records of work, specifications and meeting notes. It may be easier to fill in the record when you do the learning, so it is still fresh in your mind rather than waiting until your skills maintenance record is due.
The easiest way to add an example of on-the-job learning to your skills maintenance record is to submit it to MBIE directly via the LBP portal online. Alternatively, you can download the record of on-the-job learning form and send it in the post. There are also industry providers who offer tools to assist LBPs in collating their skills maintenance record, but you need to ensure these records are passed on to MBIE when you apply to renew your LBP license.
To learn more about on-the-job learning, check out the examples provided at www.lbp.govt.nz/skills and our previous article in Build 157 (see www.buildmagazine.org.nz ) and Codewords issue 77 .
This article is an excerpt from Codewords Issue 95. Reading Codewords articles that are relevant to your licence class is a mandatory requirement for Licensed Building Practitioners. These questions can be answered through the LBP portal, online at underconstruction.placemakers.co.nz or recorded on the magazine, then provided at the time of renewal.

This article is the third in a series about the LBP Code of Ethics and what it means to you. So far, we have looked at the first 3 principles of the LBP code of ethics, and now we will cover the final principle – Behave Professionally
The Code of Ethics (COE) applies to all LBPs regardless of whether they are an employer, a contractor, or working for wages. As an LBP carrying out building or alteration work, you risk having a complaint made against you if you do not behave professionally.
The Building Practitioners Board (the Board) noted in a recent complaint decision (CB26224) that the COE differentiates between LBPs who are in business and those who are employed. Employed LBPs are unlikely to be involved in certain affairs, for example pricing work or running a business, and their obligation is limited to the instructions of their employer.
The following seven standards which make up Principle 4 come down to the things most LBPs understand and adhere to, whether they are employed or use as the foundation in their own business.
Behave professionally
When carrying out or supervising building work, you must act professionally and treat the clients and your colleagues with respect.
Act in good faith during dispute resolution
If there is a dispute between you and your client, you should attempt to resolve it and be available to discuss it with them so that all parties can express their views and be heard. You must be respectful and act in a professional manner at all times during the process.
In the Board decision referred to above, the LBP was abusive and threatening towards the clients. The clients were so intimidated that they increased security measures at their home and made a complaint to the police.
You must price work fairly and reasonably
You must not use inappropriate methods to win a contract, including accepting or paying bribes. Do not quote unrealistically low prices just to get the job and then add extras to make up costs once the work is underway.
If any issues arise during the work which will cause additional costs, you need to let the client know and get their agreement before those costs are incurred.
For example, you may find soft ground during foundation excavations that would need an Engineer to investigate. This would lead to additional costs, so you must let the client know so that they can make an informed decision.
Declare and manage actual or potential conflicts of interest appropriately
A conflict of interest exists when you, your whānau, or company have a personal or financial connection which may adversely affect your professional judgement or actions. This is not to say you cannot do the job, but it is important to declare it to an appropriate person, such as the client, and manage those conflicts appropriately.
For example, an LBP has bought materials from a company owned by his brother, knowing he will receive some perks further down the track. However, the quote he provided to his client said he would buy the materials from the company the client stipulated based on their ethical and sustainability standards. He does not tell the client he has done this. The LBP has left himself open to a complaint to the Board.
Maintain confidentiality of client details unless there is good reason for sharing information
If you become aware of a client’s confidential information, you must take all reasonable steps to keep that information confidential, unless you are legally required or authorised to disclose it. This could include seeing a private document which the client inadvertently left in plain view.
Acknowledge and respect the cultural norms and values of your clients and colleagues
Make sure you act in a way that is respectful of the cultures and values of your clients and workmates and make an effort not to intentionally cause offence to others.
Conduct your business in a methodical and responsible manner
If you run your own business, make sure you maintain accurate accounts and records. Ensure the way you operate is honest, fair, and professional.
Charging the client for an item a second time because your records are not up to date will not improve their confidence in your business practices.
Summary
The COE upholds the integrity of the licensing regime to protect the public and maintain their confidence in LBPs.
The COE is not designed to catch people out. It is a plain language document that sets out the level of ethical behaviour expected of LBPs.
Further information on the COE is available on MBIE’s LBP website. This includes resources to support your understanding of the COE. The resources include a detailed guidance document, a poster (including in te reo Māori, Chinese (simplified), Hindi, and Samoan) and an online learning module which can be claimed as a skills maintenance point once completed.

This is the second article in the series looking at the history of the Licensed Building Practitioners Scheme with MBIE’s Bruce Duggan
Starting in the late 1990s and continuing for the next several years, the building industry was in turmoil trying to figure out what was going wrong. The regulator of the day, the Building Industry Authority (BIA), commissioned a report – more about this later – and the Government Administration Select Committee published Weathertightness of buildings in New Zealand in 2003, mainly in response to a recommendation in the BIA-commissioned report.
One of the first signs of the seriousness of the problem was that the BIA excluded face-sealed cladding systems in high-risk areas from the Approved Document E2/AS1 External Moisture .
A new term appeared in the NZ vocabulary, and it quickly became a dirty and loaded phrase…
Leaky buildings
‘Leaky building syndrome’ was a problem where moisture was getting into the wall framing of our houses, and then seeping further.
Unlike a roof leaking due to damage or age, this was about water getting in through the wall claddings – mainly, but not limited to, at penetrations through the cladding. Insufficient clearances below the claddings, and the difference in height between the finished levels outside in relation to the floor level inside, were other critical weathertightness areas.
With the widespread practice of using sheet material claddings to give a monolithic look, there was not enough care around the flashing systems – for example, at the top corners of the exterior joinery.
Level entry areas into houses were also a problem.
Who was to blame?
A subsequent report called the problem a “systemic failure”, meaning that it wasn’t just one section of the industry or a particular product that was at fault – it appeared as though a large part of our thinking hadn’t caught up with the new freedoms that the Building Act 1991 had given us.
House design was tending to be somewhat false – for example a client might want their house to look like something from the Mediterranean. The problem then was that, to keep costs down and make other factors such as insulation possible, the design called for timber framing and a plaster finish – often on a rigid sheet substrate. This is the false design referred to – making a light timber-framed building look like a solid, monolithic structure and the inherent weatherproofing design issues that come with that.
The issues identified included:
A lack of essential detailing and installation practices at critical joints and junctions.
Installers not keeping up with installation instructions from manufacturers, the classic example being the changing of nailing patterns for the fixing of bracing sheets, or how a new product needs to be installed.
Critical flashings being omitted for aesthetic reasons – a window head flashing for instance, which would compromise the monolithic look.
Materials and products being accepted as fit-for-purpose when they hadn’t been tested for that situation, for example the paint coating on a rigid sheet cladding material that required face sealing to make it weathertight.
Councils approving a product shown on the site documents when, in fact, it may not have been approved for use in this situation.
The use of new materials – a prime example would be the 1996 decision to allow untreated pine to be used for the structural framework of a house.
Untreated pine was not a direct cause of water entering a house, but it did create a very significant structural problem once the moisture got to it. The cost of repair of a leaky building was, and still is, greatly increased where this timber – marketed as chemical-free – was used. Remember the collapsed cantilevered deck from the previous article? It turned out the joists were untreated!
Building inspections were still being carried out as they had been for years – the new Building Code didn’t bring about a more thorough regime for inspectors to follow in checking areas critical to the structural and weathertightness integrity of the building.
The BIA commissioned a report into what happened and why, and in the second half of 2002, the Report of the Overview Group on the Weathertightness of Buildings , better known as the Hunn Report – the name of the chairman of the Overview Group – was released.
This is when we knew we had a real problem…
See the next issue for the continuation of this series.

The summer of 2023 has proven to be one of New Zealand’s most challenging, with severe weather hitting most of Te Ika-a-Māui North Island and affecting the lives and livelihoods of thousands of New Zealanders
In the month of January, Tāmaki Makaurau Auckland received 45% of its annual rainfall according to the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric research, with many areas of Te Ika-a-Māui receiving over 400% of normal January rainfall.
In February came ex-tropical Cyclone Gabrielle, bringing widespread flooding and damage to land and buildings across Te Ika-a-Māui, cutting off several communities from the rest of the country.
We know the road to recovery will be long and will bring many challenges. The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) is here to support home and building owners, and those in the building sector, as our communities look to start their journey.
MBIE has developed and updated a number of resources to provide information and guidance to help Licensed Building Practitioners navigate the remediation and recovery of buildings that have been damaged by flooding.
Placard information
If the building you are working on has a rapid building assessment placard, you need to know what this means. MBIE has produced information on what rapid building assessment placards are and what they mean.
You must not start repair work on a building with a red or yellow placard without first contacting your local council to discuss this. The council will, if appropriate, issue authorisation to access the building. In some cases, access may be refused, for instance due to a high risk to life or safety. In the case of a red placard, it is likely that a Detailed Damage Evaluation will need to be undertaken. This may also be recommended for a yellow or white placard.
Flood damaged buildings
This guidance provides advice on what to consider before undertaking repairs and how to minimise future damage.
It includes some helpful information about how to identify potential flood damage to different building elements, and a suggested list of building areas that should be inspected for damage to help you identify what remedial work may be needed.
It also talks about some of the risks associated with such damage, to help you carry out the remedial work safely.
Read the flood damaged buildings guidance HERE .
Damage to plasterboard
Flood damage frequently means that the plasterboard wall linings in a building are damaged. This may be due to direct exposure to water, which could see the lining become mouldy or discoloured, or could also occur if there has been movement of the building due to foundation settlement caused by instability of the land under or around the house. This may lead to cracking at corners or other junctions.
MBIE has produced information to help check for potential damage, clarify why it’s important to repair plasterboard, identify the types of plasterboard you may be working with, and explain the regulations surrounding the use of plasterboard.
Read more about damage to plasterboard HERE .
Slope stability
MBIE has created a quick guide, which provides direction for designers and home and building owners on how to go about remediating any damage done to their buildings or surrounding areas, where the foundations or the ground have been affected by flooding or landslides.
It covers safety issues, what to look for, what to do if the work is urgent, and exemptions that might apply.
Read the slope stability quick guide HERE .
Building consent exemptions
This quick guide provides information on what building work may not require a building consent following a severe weather event or earthquake. It focusses on exemptions that apply when remediating flood damage. The guide covers everything from fences and outdoor structures through to windows and internal walls, including a section on plumbing.
Read more about building consent exemptions HERE .
Helplines and resources
The months ahead will require a lot of tough mahi. If you notice you or people around you are struggling, particularly if you are living or working in areas affected by the January floods or Cyclone Gabrielle, the Ministry of Health has a wealth of free helplines and resources for anyone to use.

MBIE identifies four ‘categories of learning’ for LBPs to focus their activities on.
Just over a year ago, the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) decided to review the Licensed Building Practitioners (LBP) skills maintenance framework. Their intent was to ensure the scheme would help create a credible, innovative and productive sector without becoming overly arduous for those involved in the scheme.
“Ongoing professional development is important for any professional registration body. It’s a way of ensuring members are keeping up with changes and remaining professionally competent,” says LBP registrar Mark Scully.
“Skills maintenance is the Continued Professional Development (CPD) programme for LBPs.”
While the review is not yet complete, MBIE has identified and announced four ‘categories of learning’ it deems relevant to competent LBP practice.
“Ongoing professional development is important for any professional registration body. It’s a way of ensuring members are keeping up with changes and remaining professionally competent – LBP registrar Mark Scully.
LBPs are encouraged to consider activities across these areas:
Technical skills & knowledge.
Regulatory knowledge.
Workplace safety.
Professional development.
Recognition of on-the-job learning is also a key component of the skill maintenance review. LBPs struggling to locate training in their area often already have the resources they need to keep up to date.
Aside from reading educational magazines such as Under Construction, or attending PlaceMakers’ industry seminars, there are various learning opportunities in day-to-day work.
A simple question that LBPs looking for relevant activities might ask themselves is “when I’m on the joband I don’t know something, where do I go to find out?”
Internet reasearching, as well as discussion with building inspectors and other experts, can all contribute to skills maintenance learning.
LBPs are encouraged to record their learning activities online at www.lbp.govt.nz . In case youare selected to have your learning audited, make sure to keep hardcopy proof of your learning, suchas Under Construction’s ‘PROVE YOUR KNOW HOW’ coupons filed away in a safe spot!
Understanding proposed changes to B1 (Structure)
Keeping up to date with new products and application methods
Keeping up to date with building act amendments
Construction Contract Act changes
Knowledge of Resource Management Act process
Understanding edge protection/scaffold requirements
Site hazard management training
Learning how to use a new invoicing system to streamline paperwork
Learning how to better manage your staff

The Board recently handed down a significant sanction against carpenter Henry Rogo. The Board chose to publish the details of the matter due to the seriousness of the offending and the strong penalty
It is important that LBPs are aware of the consequences of negligent and/or incompetent supervision so they can avoid similar outcomes.
Mr Rogo was found to have:
Supervised building work or building inspection work in a negligent and incompetent manner.
Supervised building work or building inspection work that does not comply with a building consent.
Mr Rogo was engaged as a supervisor to complete a new residential build in Wellington. The building work was carried out by unlicensed labourers working as contractors. He did have one experienced builder in Wellington, but that person was engaged on the build of his own house.
Mr Rogo was residing in Auckland during the build and visited the Wellington build once a week. When on site, he did not carry out adequate checks of the building work or ensure that compliance issues were being dealt with. He also displayed a lack of knowledge of what was occurring on site and the issues raised in council inspections.
The Board heard evidence that there were repeated failures of the work carried out under Mr Rogo’s supervision and no real steps taken to ensure compliance was achieved. This was evident in a Notice to Fix issued by the Porirua City Council. The inspections also identified non-compliance with the building consent.
The majority of the issues should not have arisen in the first place. It was clear that the labourers on the site carrying out the work were out of their depth and were not receiving any guidance or direction. As a result, it was falling to the Council Building Control Officers who were carrying out inspections to provide instructions by way of their site notes.
According the Board, the Building Consent Authority’s role is to check that the building work has been carried out in accordance with the building consent, not to instruct builders on how to build. It was clear to the Board that the Respondent was derelict in his duties as a supervisor.
The Board cancelled Mr Rogo’s LBP Carpentry and Site 1 licences with a stand-down period of six months before he can reapply for licensing. The Board also ordered Mr Rogo to pay $5,500 towards the costs of the inquiry and stipulated that this decision would be publicised.
What can be learned from this decision
Inadequate supervision and a lack of knowledge of what was occurring on site led Mr Rogo to be disciplined by the Board. It is clear that Mr Rogo did not apply a sufficient level of supervision given the skills and experience of those on site and the complexity of the work.
LBPs need to understand the skills and knowledge required to supervise building work and to make an informed judgement as to the level of supervision required. Supervisors also need to have adequate quality control processes in place to build right the first time, rather than overly relying on council inspections after the fact.
The LBP Practice Note – Supervision provides guidance on using supervision correctly, as well as risk-based considerations for determining how to supervise a particular job. LBPs are strongly encouraged to read it in detail.
This Practice Note can be found on the LBP website, along with this and other past decisions: https://www.lbp.govt.nz

The recently refreshed LBP handbook is a valuable resource for all current and aspiring LBPs
MBIE recently refreshed the LBP handbook, previously known as ‘Understanding the Regulatory Environment’. The handbook is primarily a resource for building practitioners during the LBP application process, to help them understand the regulatory environment LBPs operate in. However, it is a valuable tool for all LBPs as it provides an easy-to-understand update on the wider building and construction system.
What the handbook covers
Part one sets out general information about the LBP scheme. This section outlines the definitions of restricted building work and supervision.  It also provides information about the minimum standard of licensing, LBP licence classes, skills maintenance and working within your competence.
Part two looks at the roles and responsibilities of LBPs, home owners, registered and non-registered trades, and building consent authorities. This is worth checking out if you engage with clients and other practitioners.
Part three outlines the contractual relationship between contractors and clients. It includes information about obligations: eg, a contractor must provide a residential client with a written contract and other documentation for if the project will cost $30,000 or more (including GST), or if a client requests one.
Part four sets out rights and responsibilities under the Health and Safety at Work Act 2015.
Part five outlines the building regulatory framework including relevant information under the Building Act 2004, the NZ Building Code and relevant building standards.
Part six describes the building and resource consent process, including applying for a building consent and/or variation of a building consent, inspections, obtaining a code compliance certificate and the penalties for building without a consent where one was required. This section will be useful if you regularly advise clients about the consent process.
How the handbook can help you
The handbook can provide anyone with a great summary of the building system and how their role fits in.
It includes self-assessment questions that summarise content and allow you to test your knowledge. Rules do change over time and it is your responsibility to keep up to date with those changes. The handbook can help you meet your responsibilities.
How you can access the handbook and other important information
You can find and download the handbook on the LBP website ( www.lbp.govt.nz ).
The handbook is a great tool for understanding your obligations,  and you can also keep up to date by subscribing to LBP Updates on the LBP website. You can get the latest versions of technical documents and guidance and subscribe to the Codewords e-newsletter on the Building Performance website ( www.building.govt.nz ).

BCITO’s support isn’t limited to just apprentices; it offers a number of opportunities to employers and their staff, allowing them to pursue further training while achieving higher industry standards
Each year, BCITO commits to various incentives that support individuals or businesses into achieving higher qualifications. Chief executive Ruma Karaitiana says the organisation has set aside specific funds for various grants and scholarships.
“While our core function is training apprentices, we’re also interested in ways we can contribute to further developing the industry people we work with,” he says. “This is part of our goal to contribute to improving the building industry’s capability while helping to build the capability of individuals.”
BCITO gives employers within the building industry access to study programmes to help develop and grow their businesses. They are available to employers of current BCITO trainees. This support helps employers to run successful long-term businesses and to provide ongoing investment in training and employment within NZ’s building industry.
Employers can select any training or development assistance which best suits their personal or business development needs, such as:
BCITO courses such as Leading Hand, Site Supervisor or Diploma in Construction Management.
Consultation with a business advisor.
Short courses or seminars on small business management, estimating or contract management.
Higher level business-related qualifications.
See www.bcito.org.nz/employers-and-industry/employers/employer-development-grants for information on how to apply.
BCITO awards five scholarships annually to recently completed (or soon to be completed) graduates, looking to further their career.
These scholarships enable graduates to add to their qualifications and encourage ongoing training as a path to professional success.
BCITO graduate scholarships help set a benchmark for continuing excellence and lifelong learning in the construction industry. To be eligible, applicants need to have graduated, or be graduating from, a BCITO-supported training programme within the year of application.
2014’s Graduate Scholarship recipients were:
Robert Pinder, Downes Decorating Service Ltd, Rolleston.
Campbell Findlay, Isles Construction Ltd, Palmerston North.
Billy Stansfield, Devo Construction, Auckland.
Sol-Jah Tino, Sol Tino Builder, Waitakere.
Ryan Smith-Pilling, Nailing It Ltd, Feilding.
“The BCITO Board has set aside specific funds in its reserves for various grants and scholarships. While our core function is training apprentices, we’re also interested in ways we can contribute to further developing the people we work with in the industry” – chief executive Ruma Karaitiana
They were able to show evidence of their successes in the industry and all expressed a clear commitment to their trade. Each of them clearly demonstrated a drive to succeed and showed solid career planning, detailing the courses and training that they hope to complete during the next 12 months using the scholarship grant.
BCITO graduate scholarships are an ongoing initiative. For more information and to know when to apply, keep an eye out at www.bcito.org.nz/apprentices/bcito-graduate-scholarships
BCITO also offers ten Outward Bound scholarships each year to specialist trade apprentices across all sectors.
Designed to encourage self-confidence, self-awareness, self-motivation and personal responsibility, Outward Bound challenges participants physically and mentally.
Past winners have returned from their adventure happier, fitter, and with increased motivation and confidence. Encouraging tolerance and compassion towards others, this 21-day course can seriously change a life!
Scholarship winners represent BCITO alongside apprentices from across the building and construction industry, as part of the annual joint initiative between Outward Bound and the Built Environment Training Alliance (BETA).
Keep your eyes peeled on BCITO.org.nz in late February/early March for details of how an apprentice can apply to be a part of the 2015 programme.
To be successful in applying for any of the above, applicants will need to show evidence of success in the industry and commitment to their trade. BCITO looks for individuals and businesses with drive and determination to succeed.

Changes to skills maintenance requirements for Licensed Building Practitioners include compulsory activities
At the end of January, the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) completed its review of the LBP skills maintenance scheme. The resulting changes are outlined below and will come into force from 2 November.
“The current scheme requires LBPs to earn a set number of points in order to retain their licence, much of which relies on self-directed learning on the LBP’s part,” says LBP registrar Paul Hobbs. “This system has been in place since the scheme’s inception, albeit with some slight adjustments over time.
“The review found there are some credibility issues with the current scheme, including some LBPs doing activities that are not relevant to their licence class in order to earn the required number of points. The new framework seeks to move away from an entirely points-based system in favour of a new ‘mixed-model’ approach, with the aim of being more meaningful and relevant across all seven licence classes.”
The new scheme was developed in consultation with LBPs, stakeholders and representatives from the Building Practitioners Board. It consists of both compulsory and elective activities – a departure from the current framework, which relies solely on elective activities and gaining enough points to satisfy the respective “two-yearly continued licensing requirement”.
The new compulsory activities, which will account for 50% of an LBP’s skills maintenance points regardless of what licence they hold, include:
Reading LBP news, which is part of MBIE’s Codewords newsletter, and
Identifying two examples of on-the-job learning over the two-year skills cycle.
The ‘LBP News’ articles will focus on legislative and technical changes. LBPs will only have to read articles relevant to their licence class competencies (and underpinning area or areas of practice). They will be required to complete a short quiz to ensure the key points have been understood.
“If you have a trade publication and/or series of seminars or events that have served you well in the past, then it is a great idea to maintain these connections in the elective portion of the scheme.” – LBP registrar Paul Hobbs
The on-the-job learning component recognises that LBPs often learn or upskill as they are working in the design office or on site. To acknowledge this upskilling, the new scheme is designed to harness these naturally occurring learning opportunities. For example, designers should look to exploit occasions where they have used an innovative or new design method, while trade-based LBPs could cite the use of a new construction method or product by capturing this in their respective certificate or record of work (and photocopying it for their skills maintenance file).
LBPs are still expected to complete elective activities, such as reading Under Construction ; however, they will only have to record half the time they previously needed to.
“The total amount of time spent upskilling will remain largely the same as it is currently,” says Paul. “The intent of the new scheme isn’t to decrease skills maintenance time, but to put more of an emphasis on relevant and meaningful learning outcomes.
“If you have a trade publication and/or series of seminars or events that have served you well in the past, then it is a great idea to maintain these connections in the elective portion of the scheme.”
The new scheme can be implemented under the existing LBP Rules, so no legislative change has been necessary. MBIE will road test the new scheme during the first half of this year, so that any issues are resolved before LBPs are required to transition from 2 November.
Further information on the new scheme will be published in upcoming editions of Codewords and Under Construction . MBIE staff will also support the roll-out of the new scheme later in the year, by partnering with building merchants and trade associations.
LBPs will be required to transition into the new scheme on the date of their next two-yearly skills maintenance anniversary that follows 2 November 2015 (for example, if your next skills maintenance submission date is 19 January 2016, then following that you would need to follow the new format).
The new scheme does not introduce any new activities, it simply makes two existing activities compulsory – on-the-job learning and reading LBP News in Codewords .
It is based on other successful skills maintenance models and will prove more meaningful over coming years.
The mixed-model approach means LBPs will no longer be responsible for sourcing all their skills maintenance material.
A 50% elective component still remains in place, so LBPs can still gain points from attending seminars, conferences, reading industry publications and attending workplace safety training and the like, which are relevant or of interest to them.
On-the-job learning will feature as a mandatory requirement, so that upskilling occurring during everyday work activities can be captured and used for skills maintenance.
More information will be provided over the coming months.
“Remember, it’s not all about the points, it’s about quality learning outcomes that will ensure you are up-to-date and current in your building knowledge.” says Paul.
Reading industry publications such as Under Construction is still an essential part of skills maintenance; however, this will now fall under elective activities

BCITO research shows that training apprentices generates profit
B CITO research shows that for every $1.00 spent on training a carpenter, a business will benefit by up to $4.70 over a ten-year period.
This is the first time that in-depth research of this nature has been undertaken in New Zealand.
There’s a misconception, held by some, that training an apprentice costs a business money – with little or no return. This research proves that, in the long run, that’s not true. Investing in industry training is not just a cost to be minimised, it’s an investment that can grow your business.
Obviously the return on investment doesn’t kick in immediately. The break-even point – which is when the cost of training is offset by the extra profit generated by training – is three to four years: about the same time as completion of an apprenticeship. Profit keeps increasing the longer the trained person remains with the firm, making staff retention a factor; the longer an employer keeps trained staff, the more profitable they become.
“During the past two years, BCITO has experienced unprecedented growth in new apprenticeships but the construction industry remains woefully short of skilled tradespeople,” says Greg Durkin, group manager of stakeholder engagement for BCITO. “We need more businesses to come on board and train our young people. With this research, we can clearly prove that training an apprentice is a positive investment for employers.”
As part of the project, carpentry business owners were asked about their firms’ structure, including the number of people working there and what roles they were in. From this information, a model of an average firm in the industry was developed.
While the payback period for both trained and untrained workers appear similar, the positive return from training is sustained well into the future, increasing the cumulative benefit each year.
Other findings show that, when compared with a business that doesn’t invest in industry training, a carpentry firm that trains all staff will:
Grow 6% faster.
Charge $0.44 more per hour per person.
Estimate work 3% more accurately.
Do 2% fewer hours to complete the same task or project.
“It is such a worthwhile expense for every business to invest in training apprentices,” says BCITO chief executive Ruma Karaitiana. “Not only does having skilled workers improve your reputation and benefit your business overall, this research shows that, over time, a business’ bottom line is significantly improved.”
The methodology used in this project works back from a measure of economic return, such as cumulative profits over time. The drivers of profitability were broken down to identify individual attributes of a firm’s performance and evaluate the relative importance of these. The impact of a team’s trade and management proficiencies on these attributes was then considered. Finally, the contribution of training to an individual’s proficiency was weighted relative to the contribution from experience.

Changes to the Building Act will mean building consents won’t be needed for some new or expanded types of low-risk building work, like sleepouts, sheds, carports, outdoor fireplaces and ground-mounted solar panels
New building consent exemptions are being added to the Building Act. These exemptions will save building owners time and money, as they will not have to go to their local council for consent for common low-risk building work. This reduction in building consents will also allow councils to focus on building work that is higher risk, helping to boost productivity.
Changes from late August This package of new exemptions adds to the work that can already be done without a building consent, outlined in Schedule 1 of the Building Act.
Some types of the new exempt building work can be done without the help of a professional, while others require the involvement of a Chartered Professional Engineer or Licensed Building Practitioner (LBP). This is a big win for LBPs, as it will raise their profile and encourage home and building owners to use them.
At the time of print, the new exemptions were expected to commence at the end of August.
Larger single-storey detached buildings Additional exemptions will increase the size of current exemptions for single-storey detached buildings. Kitchen and bathroom facilities are not included in this exemption.
New exemptions include:
kitset or prefab buildings with a maximum floor area of 30m² where a manufacturer or supplier has had the design carried out or reviewed by a Chartered Professional Engineer.
buildings with a maximum floor area of 30m² where an LBP is to carry out or supervise design and construction.
buildings with a maximum floor area of 30m² where only lightweight materials with structural components built in accordance with Acceptable Solution B1/AS1 are used – this work may be done without the help of a professional.
Some exemptions require an LBP There are some other building consent exemptions that must be carried out by a professional. These exemptions will apply if:
the design has been carried out or reviewed by a Chartered Professional Engineer.
an LBP has carried out or supervised design and construction.
The change to the exemption often applies to the size of the works. Using an LBP will allow homeowners to build larger projects than they could under current exemptions without an LBP.
Some examples of exemptions that can be carried out with an LBP include:
carports up to 40m² – up from 20m².
ground floor awnings up to 30m² – up from 20m².
ground floor verandas and porches. up to 30m² – up from 20m².
single-storey pole sheds and hay barns in rural zones with a maximum floor area of 110m².
Others don’t require an LBP Other new building consent exemptions that do not require an LBP include:
outdoor fireplaces or ovens.
flexible water storage bladders.
small pipe supporting structures.
For more information about the new exemptions, including technical requirements, see the building.govt.nz website.
This article is an excerpt from Codewords Issue 96. Reading Codewords articles that are relevant to your licence class is a mandatory requirement for Licensed Building Practitioners. These questions can be answered through the LBP portal, online at underconstruction.placemakers.co.nz or recorded on the magazine, then provided at the time of renewal.

A Christchurch-based Licenced Building Practitioner (LBP) was fined $3,500 and ordered to pay costs of $1,750 after he was found to be negligent and incompetent in the construction of a deck and retaining wall
David Driver, who holds a Bricklaying and Blocklaying Licence, was contracted to construct a timber deck and retaining wall. Upon completion, the client complained about the quality and compliance of the work. However, following the complaint, Immigration New Zealand records show that Driver had left New Zealand and has not since returned.
Poor work unveiled
The Board’s investigation found several issues with the deck, including:
The use of 50x50mm and 75x25mm landscaping pegs and 100x75mm fence posts in place of 125x125mm H5-treated piles.
Undersized bearers with unsupported joins.
An unsupported corner of the deck, relying on a 100×50 joist cantilevering 720mm (at the time of the hearing, it was sagging and at risk of collapse).
Sub-floor framing supported by the underlying ground in places.
Kwila decking timber installed tight rather than the recommended 4 to 6mm ventilation gaps.
The 1.7m high timber retaining wall appeared to have no drainage behind it, which could lead to collapse due to water build-up.
Driver also failed to ensure a consent was obtained for the work on the retaining wall. The Board found he had a duty to assess whether a consent was required before the building work commenced.
“The wall was also supporting the neighbour’s concrete wall. Given the height of the wall and the surcharge, the wall should have been specifically designed and have a building consent for its construction,” said the Board.
“The Engineer’s review noted that the wall was higher than 1.5m and that there was a surcharge. As such, a building consent was required. The Respondent should have turned his mind to this and should have ensured a building consent was in place before the building work was carried out.”
The Board also stated there was “clear evidence of poor-quality building work”, which was not Building Code-compliant, or carried out in accordance with NZS 3604 or any other compliance method.
“Looking at the level of non-compliance and the fundamental nature of the compliance failings, such as the risk of collapse, the use of non-compliant materials and fixings, and timber that was not ground-treated in contact with the ground, the Board decided that the Respondent was incompetent.”
Additionally, Driver was conducting work he did not hold a licence for (carpentry).
As a result, the Board found that Driver conducted himself in an incompetent manner regarding the deck construction and was negligent regarding the failure to obtain a building consent for the retaining wall.  He was ordered to pay a fine of $3,500 and costs of $1,750.

Advice on applying quantity surveying theory to residential building projects
In the past, pricing for a residential project meant writing a few simple calculations on the back of a paper bag – you would have added together subcontractor quotes, a merchant estimate and the cost of having a couple of people onsite for a few months and that would be enough. Add on a percentage for site overheads, multiply the whole lot by 10% and the job is done, right?
These days, to remain competitive and profitable and within contract legislation, it’s a task you should really spend some time thinking about. In addition, as a Licensed Building Practitioner (LBP) you need to ensure that you’re meeting your obligations while being as profitable and competitive as you can.
General quantity surveying (QS) principles can help a lot here. They can be used for any project, even the smallest renovation job. If you consistently apply these principles, along with best practice, you will be able to more accurately price jobs and projects will run more efficiently.
Principle #1 — materials measurement
It is very important to make your materials measurement as accurate as possible. This might sound obvious, but if you win a job with a merchant estimate and find out it was missing key items or under measured, that can cause real issues. You might then need to try to negotiate with the merchant to have the extra goods delivered for free or negotiate a variation with the client so that you can continue with the job.
Avoiding these issues is not the only reason that you want your material measurement to be accurate and detailed. The other reason is specifically aligned to principle #2.
Principle #2 – labour measurement
While measuring labour is a standard tool for quantity surveyors, builders don’t always understand how to do it well when they price their own work.
To measure labour for a job, it is best to use a labour constant, which is a figure based on how long it will take to complete a task on a per-measurement basis, such as per square metre. It is calculated as a constant figure that can easily be multiplied.
You use a labour constant so that regardless of the measurement (or size of the task), it is easy to figure out the amount of labour needed to complete it.
Example: if your project requires 100m2 of plasterboard then you want to know how many m2 of plasterboard can be installed per hour:
1. You know it takes five minutes to put up 1m2 of plasterboard.
2. Divide five minutes by 60 minutes (this will give you a labour constant of 0.08/m2 of plasterboard).
3. Times the measure (100m2) by the constant (0.08/m2) to calculate your labour requirement in hours – 100 x 0.08 = 8 hours.
Materials measurement and labour measurement are the first building blocks for pricing a job effectively. If you have your materials measure correct, and you apply a labour constant to each line item, then your labour amount and costs are likely to be correct too.
Luckily, you don’t have to work out a labour constant for every task (unless you want to) because there are resources to assist you. There are a variety of books and online quantity surveying tools available to help you understand what average labour constants should be. You can also get professional help and advice by hiring a quantity surveyor.

Building inspections are an essential part of the building process, so Under Construction spoke to Auckland Council inspections manager Jeff Fahrensohn to get a view from the other side
The average new house under construction can face up to 12 or more inspections throughout the build process, and Jeff says that, at each stage, missing paperwork is one of the most common reasons for a fail.
“There is a lot of paperwork required now. I’d say it has increased ten-fold compared to several years ago. I think there’s an element of builders relying on the council to point out to them what paperwork is needed and when. We don’t mind that approach, because we do understand that builders and project managers don’t always have time to sift through all the paperwork they need – given the pressure everyone in the industry is under at the moment.
“However, it does slow down the whole process by creating churn at the back end, which can delay the issuance of a Code Compliance Certificate. When a builder or project manager sends in the missing paperwork, it’s not always received by the same inspector. It means whoever receives it has to start from scratch trying to match what was sent in to what was requested.”
Full steam ahead
Jeff says that the past two years have been the busiest he’s seen in Auckland since becoming an inspector in 1996.
“We have a team of around 140 inspectors completing up to 1,000 inspections a day. We used to pride ourselves on offering next-day inspections, but we’re just too busy for that to be practical now.
Our wait times are at around three days at the moment, which I think is still pretty good!”
While the boom continues to apply pressure across all aspects of Auckland’s building industry, Jeff is pleased to note that pass rates are coming back to pre-boom levels.
“The quality is definitely getting better. If you go back to February 2015, probably 40% of all our inspections were failing and now it’s around 25%,” he says. “We’re finding people are taking a lot more time in terms of quality and I think that’s in part thanks to people having adjusted to the amount of work that’s on at the moment and recent industry changes.
“Failure rates consistently increase when new legislation or tweaks to the building code are introduced, which happens constantly.”
The pass rate for follow-up inspections is in the high 90s, which Jeff says is evidence of builders learning from their previous mistakes, which he credits as another reason for improving pass rates.
General tips and tricks
Jeff suggests builders looking to improve their inspection process should:
Ensure they’re ready for an inspection by going through their own checks, which can help pick up little things such as missing bolts or top plate connectors.
Learn from failures, identify knowledge gaps and fill them as soon as they can.
Not be afraid to ask questions and enter into dialogue with inspectors to make the most of their knowledge.
Part 2 of the article will be featured in the next print edition.

TITLE   : Grounds for complaints

Irina Vanags, Investigator for the Occupational Regulation Team at MBIE, covers why an LBP may be subject to a complaint and what to do if you are
The Licensed Building Practitioners scheme (LBP) was introduced in 2012 to improve the construction sector’s performance and hold practitioners to account. While the LBP licence comes with a formal recognition of the builder’s competence and grants the holder a right to carry out or supervise Restricted Building Work (RBW), it also sets up high expectations of the LBP’s performance and behaviour.
The RBW and other work must be completed to a certain standard and be compliant with the Building Code. If standards aren’t met, clients can take their grievances to the Building Practitioners Board (the Board).
Deviation from the expected standards or the building consent, negligent work and failure to provide a Record of Work (RoW) are a few examples of grounds for complaints the Board has received from the affected parties.
Grounds for discipline
There are 11 grounds for discipline as stated in section 317 of the Building Act 2004. Those include:
Being convicted by any court in New Zealand or elsewhere of any offence punishable by imprisonment for a term of six months or more.
Carrying out or supervising negligent or incompetent building work.
Carrying out or supervising building work of a type that the practitioner is not licensed to carry out or supervise.
Carrying out or supervising building work that does not comply with a building consent.
Failure to provide a Certificate of Work about any plans and specifications required to accompany the building consent application (Designers) or a RoW on completion of the RBW (Building Practitioners).
Holding oneself as being licensed to carry out or supervise building work or building inspection work of a type that you are not licensed to carry out.
Making a false declaration or representation, knowing it to be false or misleading.
Breaching the code of ethics for Licensed Building Practitioners.
Conducting oneself in a manner that brings, or is likely to bring, the LBP regime into disrepute.
The most common ground for discipline is negligent work or poor workmanship. This may include anything from using incorrect fixings to any deviation from good trade practice or the Building Code.
It is important to remember that the term ‘negligent work’ covers not only the RBW but any type of building work where the LBP did not demonstrate due diligence in completing the work.
If an LBP does not provide a RoW following the completion of RBW, they may also face a penalty. Remember, if you did not complete the project, or your contract was terminated, you are still required to provide the RoW for work you completed.
It is worthwhile mentioning that the Board does not yet enforce Code of Ethics breaches, simply because the Code of Ethics was only recently developed. There is a one-year transition period until 26 October 2022 for LBPs to familiarise themselves with the expected standards of behaviour in the industry.
Complaints process
What happens if your client/contractor/council makes a complaint against you to the Board under one of the above grounds ? An investigator from the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) will contact you and provide you with a full set of complaint documentation. You will have 20 working days to study the documentation, consult with your lawyer (if necessary), obtain expert opinion (if required) and produce a response.
While the situation may be extremely stressful for you, it is a good idea to provide your response to the investigator, as this is your chance to present your side of the story, explain your actions, and provide evidence to support your statements. Upon receiving your response, the investigator will write a report to the Board summarising the information received from both parties. Consent-related documentation may be requested from the Council as well.
The Board makes a decision on whether to proceed with the hearing. The hearing can be held on papers in some cases, which means that the Board will decide based on written submissions from both parties. The purpose of the hearing is to further investigate and determine if a disciplinary offence has been committed by the LBP. If the Board decides it has, then they will also consider the appropriate penalty, if costs should be imposed, and whether the matters should be published.
Penalties
The penalties may include one or more of the following:
Suspension or cancellation of the LBP licence.
Restrictions on the kind of work LBP can do.
A fine of up to $10,000.
Order the LBP to complete certain training.
A formal reprimand of the person.
Order the LBP to pay costs.
Knowing your rights and responsibilities, fine-tuning your client interaction practices and increasing your level of competence would help you achieve a high level of compliance with the current legislation and avoid going through the stressful disciplinary process.
This article is an excerpt from Codewords Issue 105 . Reading Codewords articles that are relevant to your licence class is a mandatory requirement for Licensed Building Practitioners. These questions can be answered through the LBP portal, online on the Under Construction website or recorded on the magazine, then provided at the time of renewal.

Starting your own business can be a daunting task and often we learn on the job. You’re confident on the tools and know you can do a great job on-site, but ensuring your business practices are up to scratch is just as important for building a successful business
To help you on your journey, business.govt.nz has a series of ‘Tips for Tradies’ videos and resource templates, so you can save time and money and run the admin side of your business as accurately as your tools.
How to price a job
Getting your pricing right is key for your business to be successful. Too high and you can scare clients away. Too low and you could be losing money on every job.
It’s important to make sure you’re quoting accurate prices to potential clients as best as you can.
There are different ways to set your prices, but the three most popular strategies are:
a) Cost-based pricing This is where you work out all the costs involved in providing a service and add a bit extra to make a profit. It works best if your costs are low and your clients are focused on keeping the price low.
b) Competitor-based pricing This is when you look at what other businesses are charging for similar work and set your price around that. You may charge less to beat their price, match them, or charge more and use a different benefit like better customer service, or getting the work done quickest to win the job.
c) Customer-based pricing This is where you work within the budget your clients have available. Usually, this works best if your clients have bigger budgets and value quality over a lower price.
It’s also important you have a markup, because it helps you meet your profit goals. To learn how to set your markup, watch the ‘How to price a job’ video in the series. There’s also a handy pricing workbook you can use to help calculate your markup.
How to prepare a quote
Once you know what you’re charging, prepare a quote that gives you the best chance of landing the job, is realistically priced, and covers your costs. One of the key principles of the Licensed Building Practitioner (LBP) code of ethics is to behave professionally – and that means pricing work fairly and reasonably.
Quotes are a great opportunity to build trust, put your best foot forward, and show your client you understand their needs and will do the job well.
Business.govt.nz shows you how to create a strong construction proposal for your potential clients in the ‘How to prepare a quote’ video. They also give you a free template to use that covers your legal requirements and contract must-haves.
Remember – it’s a legal requirement to have a contract for all building work valued over $30,000, and best practice to have one even when it’s less than that. As an LBP, you’re also bound by our code of ethics.
Variations to contracts
Sometimes when working on a job, the scope can change unexpectedly. You find yourself with more work than you initially planned for, which is taking more time and effort on the job. This is where variations to contracts can help.
Variations can be any proposed change to the original job, but common variations include:
Changes to the terms agreed, such as timeframes and when payments are due.
Changes to the level of quality and finish for the agreed project price.
Changes to the size or complexity of the job, or the products to be used.
Unforeseen circumstances that lead to additional work or delays.
Another key part of the LBP code of ethics applies here – take responsibility for your actions. This means informing and educating your client, advising them of delays as they become apparent and always acting in their best interest.
Variations in contracts must:
Clearly state the specific terms of the contract that are being changed and what the new terms will be.
Consider any changes required to other parts of the contract as a result. This may include changing the amount charged if more work is required.
Be specific on when the variation will come into effect.
Confirm that nothing else in the contract is being amended, other than your proposed changes.
Understand your cashflow
Good cashflow management helps you to stay on top of your business finances and handle unexpected situations like natural disasters or a sudden change in the market. Managing your cashflow means setting time aside to record all your income and expenses on a regular basis, and comparing months, quarters, or years to see how much money came in, when it came in and what it was spent on.
You can also create a cash flow forecast. This will give you a future view of your business’s earnings and expenses, to help you budget.
A good cash flow forecast should show you:
Your current cash in the bank.
Expected cash income from sales or loans and assets.
Expected cash flow – which is a fancy way of showing the highs and dips of your cash reserves over time.
Your closing balance.
Business.govt.nz has a cashflow forecaster tool, which can help visualise all your incomings and outgoings.
How to prepare an invoice – and what to do if you don’t get paid on time
Invoicing can be a struggle for many small businesses. This can lead to not being paid on time, and not having enough cash for really important things – like paying yourself and your employees. Be up front from the beginning, so there are no surprises when it comes to invoice time. For bigger jobs, you may wish a phased approach where invoices are split across the work. Don’t be afraid to talk to your customer about a payment plan that works for you both – before the job starts.
Use the free business.govt.nz invoice template to make sure all the details you need to provide are given to the client in a way that makes it easy to follow, understand and most importantly – action.
If you’ve done everything right and your customer still hasn’t paid, you might need to make a valid payment claim. These have to be in writing and include details about the work you’ve done, how much is owed and a due date.
Reading Codewords articles that are relevant to your licence class is a mandatory requirement for Licensed Building Practitioners. These questions can be answered through the LBP portal, online on the Under Construction website or recorded on the magazine, then provided at the time of renewal.

Quantity surveying practices go hand-in-hand with estimating, quoting and tendering for work. These business practices are essential to operating a construction company, and getting it right is more important than ever during a period of high industry activity
As an LBP, keeping up to date with the latest information is paramount to running a successful business. We are lucky in New Zealand, as there are lots of opportunities and tools to learn and grow your business, as long as you know where to look! This article is the third and final article tying quantity surveying to being an LBP.
We often hear that LBPs are unsure where to start learning about business practices. Here are some tools and tricks for small to medium sized-enterprise (SME) builders from a quantity surveying perspective.
Business practices are relevant to your skills maintenance. Contractors have a range of regulatory obligations alongside LBP obligations, so knowledge in this area is relevant to being able to contract with consumers and participate in our building industry.
TRADE EVENTS
Get along to as many trade events as you can. Hearing from a range of informative speakers, alongside the general camaraderie these events encourage, is something you can’t put a dollar value on. Trade events are often held by different institutions, as well as merchants or other trade suppliers.
Another great place to meet and share your knowledge and listen to a range of speakers is your local Chamber of Commerce. They will generally cover more than just trade information and also give out free information for those interested in HR, business acumen, accounting, and all those other things SME builders need to understand to run their businesses profitably and efficiently.
NZTE – REGIONAL PARTNERSHIP NETWORKS
New Zealand Trade and Enterprise offers learning opportunities and funding to SMEs across New Zealand, and in many cases this includes our local trades. They can offer business mentoring, financial acumen, human resources support and training and marketing. Support is offered by way of courses around the country and one-on-one consulting and training with regional partners.
You can apply for funding for this assistance if you go to the website and become part of the network – it is definitely worth checking out. Suppliers to the NZTE have to be thoroughly vetted to ensure they are going to give value and help businesses, so it is a great place to find real value and help with funding.
You can find information on the NZTE Regional Partnership Networks on the New Zealand Trade and Enterprise website .
ESTIMATING TOOLS
There are lots of online tools – some free and others by subscription – which provide data-based industry averages across the regions for labour constants, built-up rates, and cost-planning information. Quantity surveyors use this information for estimating purposes, but it can also be useful for builders looking for estimating guidance, as it is a fantastic wealth of information.
You can also find old-fashioned paperback books that hold a wealth of information about quantity surveying. These are a common tool quantity surveyors use, alongside online services, to obtain information about labour constants. You’ll often find one within easy reach of a quantity surveyor’s desk.
Using resources to make the process quicker and easier is an added bonus. The information in these resources has been gathered through years of data analysis, and is a good basis to use when completing your own pricing work. A very handy tool to have in the office!

This seventh article in a series based on weathertight remediation workshops run by the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) – Building and Housing group focuses on avoiding leaky home liabilities.
In previous articles, we have mostly looked at pre-start considerations. In this article, we will be looking at some of the things builders need to think about when work is under way.
Re-cladding projects are like renovations on steroids, there are very few aspects of the house that won’t be affected. It is a very stressful time for the homeowner. All they typically get at the end of it is the house they thought they bought in the first place and all they have to show for it is usually a bigger mortgage.
“It is critical to minimise any risks and consequences of future failures – getting the repair done right is simply the best way to achieve this
Also, it is not just the homeowner who is effectively the client. Their funder has a vested interest in restoring value in their collateral. The territorial authority (TA), along with the government, may also be contributing if the client is participating in the Financial Assistance Package scheme. On multi-unit sites, a body corporate will be involved and usually an elected building committee will represent all of the owners.
Whether the building occupants are going or staying can make a significant difference to the operation and efficiency of a project – this should be taken into account when establishing a timeline.
Some owners may not have the desire, or the means, to vacate their home. If they are vacating, will they be taking their chattels, too, as there may be insurance implications for them remaining? It is much more efficient if household items don’t have to be moved or protected during the repair process.
In Canada, where they have been dealing with a similar problem for 20 years, second-generation failures are occurring due to a variety of factors such as inappropriate repair details, limited repair scopes and others. We are now experiencing similar issues in New Zealand.
As we all know, builders carry significant latent liability for their work. Therefore, it is critical to minimise any risks and consequences of future failures – getting the repair done right is simply the best way to achieve this.
“Good record keeping helps variation management and can help resolve potential disputes
To ensure this happens, it’s critical to work with experienced professionals. A builder should expect a designer to provide timely and appropriate details that work. If the builder comes up with his own detail, or builds something that is on the plans that they know will possibly fail, who is liable?
The law is getting much clearer on this. Good record keeping helps variation management and can help resolve potential disputes. In addition, documenting all the damage discovered with location-specific photographs builds a historical record of what was found. Quality control systems and good site supervision can assist in catching even minor errors or omissions in the rebuild process that could otherwise accumulate and contribute to future building failures.
Discovering as much damage, as early as possible, allows budgetary implications and design clarifications to be dealt with right at the start. This is especially important if the damage is worse than initially assessed.
On every project I have been involved with, there is at least some degree of non-compliant work discovered in the original structure. It is good practice to notify and discuss any discovery with the building owner (and potentially the local council) if you identify any such issues in areas you are working on.
You should also consider the temporary bracing that may be required, as the removal of bracing (either external or internal) or removal of cladding to allow for concrete nib installation may affect the integrity of the structure.
A fundamental question for most remediation projects is what timber to leave in, treat in situ or replace. There are many types of timber rot and ways of testing for them. Visual and strand tests, for example, have their uses but also their limitations.
The only way to be absolutely certain of a timber’s type and history is a lab test. Some rots are visually hard to detect and timber sampling of what appears to be sound wood can help prevent the consequences of leaving structurally unsound timber behind.
Having suitably qualified and experienced experts to interpret and instruct helps with compliance and could potentially help narrow a builder’s related latent risks. If builders have doubts about what has been instructed, they can simply get testing carried out themselves as an inexpensive form of insurance.
As with risks on any type of project, understanding the risk is key to managing it.

The New Year is when we like to think about the future. We kick back, share ideas over BBQs, strategise and set business goals. But how can we ensure our plans stay on track?
S ometimes our plans get shot up during the first engagement. Adverse weather, supplier delays, staff mistakes, or any one of hundreds of other things can go wrong, which can threaten the very existence of your business.
It’s not unusual for small businesses to experience sudden disruption. It can be scary, with huge financial implications.
But it need not be the end of the road. When your business plans get derailed, you can take action.
Acknowledge the frustration
Admit your irritation. You need to face your annoyance and anger before diving in to affect change. If you act before surmounting these feelings, you are likely to over-react and maybe even augment the problem. Deal with your frustration, so you don’t say or do something you will regret – particularly if the frustration is directed at a staff member.
Define the mountain
Get a realistic measure of the true size of the ‘mountain’. It’s likely you’ll need to make changes, but first make a shortlist of the things that have gone wrong and what impact they had, thereby ensuring your intervention will be based on reality. Under pressure, it’s easy to make a mountain out of a molehill.
This list should reflect your current situation and hopefully things won’t get any worse. However, plan as if they could, then add those impacts to your list as worst-case scenarios. Writing it all down not only helps you get a better idea of what is actually wrong (the reality), it also helps you see the upper limit of the damage. Once the worst is defined (the mountain), it can’t get any bigger.
Change your viewpoint
Female Beewolves are villainous wasps that sting honeybees with paralyzing venom, then carry them back to their larvae as food. Before leaving on raids, a female Beewolf notes her home-tunnel’s position by proximity to local markers and uses them as reference points to make her return.
If those markers are moved while she is out raiding (as Dr Nicolaas Tinbergen did when studying them), her return plans are frustrated and she ends up at the wrong spot. Rather than giving up, or returning repeatedly to the wrong place, she flies to a higher altitude to locate reference markers that are further away. Then she relocates the position of the tunnel entrance and flies directly to it using this revised plan.
Here’s the lesson:
Revised planning is best done at higher altitude. Before you react, step up and look at the bigger picture. Get a clear picture of the new situation in relation to your long-term plan and hold onto this as you move into ‘fix-it’ mode.
Major or minor?
Changing your perspective will help you determine if it really is a major event in the greater scheme of things. It will give you a better sense of proportion and protect you from over-reaction should it just appear to be a disaster, when it’s not actually that bad.
Ask yourself some questions, such as:
Do I need to make drastic or just temporary changes ?
Is this event threatening to the overall direction of my plan, or just to the timing or the means ?
Do I need to change personnel immediately (eg, replace a foreman), or persevere ?
Before leaping in to fix the problem, do a quick assessment of the critical nature of each element and determine whether they require major or minor intervention.
Concurrent corrections
Disruptions are also a good time to reflect on whether they might be indicative of a major failing which could be repeated, such as mistakes in your pricing method, design or scheduling.
While you need to take responsible action immediately and fix what needs fixing, it’s important that you don’t stop once you have ‘fixed it’. Should you move on without making definite plans for correcting any deeper issues that have arisen, you may set yourself up for similar issues in the future.
In summary
There are times in the year (eg New Year’s Day, beginning of a financial year) when it’s traditional to make plans and dream about what could be. But eventually those plans will be challenged. Don’t be surprised or put off. Few business plans ever go as intended, but success is less about getting the plan right as it is about handling the disruptions that cause them to go wrong.

As a builder, it’s in your best interest to ensure your clients know their rights and obligations
When it comes to building or renovating a house, it is important homeowners understand the consumer protection measures that are in place. Contractors can help champion change across the building and construction industry by encouraging homeowners to make informed decisions about building work.
To help homeowners get a better idea of the building process, as well as their rights and obligations, the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) is running an information and education programme on consumer protection measures relating to building work.
The measures relate to residential building work only and are included in Part4A of the Building Act 2004. They protect not just the homeowner and their investment, but the people doing the work.
“With increased activity, it’s really important that people have a good understanding of the rules around residential building work so they build it right,” says Chris Kane, Manager of MBIE’s Sector Trends and Innovation team.
The programme aims to inform homeowners about their rights and legal obligations and where to find up-to-date information when building, renovating or making home modifications.
“We want to encourage homeowners to adopt good practices from the outset, because this will help the building project run smoother,” says Chris. “The responsibility for building it right doesn’t just sit with the contractor. Homeowners need to have a better understanding of the building process before work starts to avoid unwelcome surprises that could create issues further down the track.”
The programme encourages homeowners to get familiar with the building process, have a written contract, and ask their contractor for a disclosure statement and checklist before signing.
Under the consumer protection measures, homeowners and contractors must have a written contract for building work that will cost $30,000 or more (incl GST). MBIE encourages contractors to provide a written contract for lower valued work too, so that everyone has an understanding of obligations, requirements and expectations.
If the building work is likely to cost $30,000 or more or, the contractor must provide information about their skills, qualifications, licensing status and the insurance or guarantees they provide. This is called a disclosure statement.
It’s good practice for builders to encourage homeowners to check all information carefully, to ensure they are confident in the building contractor’s ability to carry out the project. This pre-qualification can put the homeowner more at ease, which may make interaction throughout the build more pleasant.
The law also requires them to give clients a checklist, which outlines the stages of the build and the steps homeowners can take to protect themselves. If the building work is likely to cost less than $30,000, the contractor must provide a disclosure statement and checklist only if the client requests it.
MBIE has prepared a checklist covering the content required by law. It includes information on how building projects are managed, hiring contractors, what should be covered in a written contract and resolving disputes. To find out more about the checklist and disclosure statement, go to www.building.govt.nz/contracts
When the work is completed, homeowners have an automatic 12-month repair period during which contractors have to fix any defects they’ve been told about in writing. During this time period, if the builder doesn’t agree that a defect exists, the onus is on the builder to prove that is the case.
Homeowners can also take action for up to ten years if warranties in the Building Act have not been met – even if they’re not in the contract (these are called implied warranties). MBIE recommends homeowners address issues as soon as they become known. During this time period, if the builder doesn’t agree that a defect exists, the onus is on the homeowner to prove it does.
“The consumer protection measures are part of a wider programme of work to strengthen our building and construction industry,” says Chris. “They encourage a professional, no-surprises relationship between the homeowner and the contractor to ensure the best possible outcome – safer, healthier, more durable buildings for everyone.”
MBIE provides booklets for homeowners and contractors that outline the different responsibilities. Know your rights – a homeowner’s guide to the consumer protection measures, and Do your homework – a contractor’s guide can be downloaded from the website. You can also order free copies by emailing info@building.govt.nz
MBIE has also created some videos that describe the process. Check it out here .

When conflicts arise between parties involved in a building project, finding the right resolution is crucial. As Licensed Building Practitioners (LBPs), you may encounter disputes that require careful handling. This article covers some methods for resolving these issues
B elow are some methods LBPs can use when conflicts arise between parties involved in a building project. Mediation and self-resolution: Mediation is a common approach in Aotearoa New Zealand. It involves bringing disputing parties together to discuss their concerns and find mutually acceptable solutions. As an LBP, consider suggesting mediation when faced with disagreements related to building work.
Consumer rights: If you’re dealing with consumer-related disputes, understanding consumer rights is essential. Encourage clients to understand and assert their rights and seek fair outcomes.
Formal complaints, arbitration, and adjudication: In more complex cases, formal complaints, arbitration, or adjudication may be necessary. These processes provide structured ways to address disagreements and reach decisions.
Disputes tribunal and courts: When other methods fail, the Disputes Tribunal or courts become relevant. These legal avenues allow parties to present evidence and seek binding resolutions.
Determinations: A determination allows the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) to thoroughly review and consider the facts and make a legally binding decision. As an LBP, you can apply for a determination, and you can participate in someone else’s determination if you were involved in the disputed project.
Remember, choosing the right approach depends on the specific circumstances. Prioritise effective communication and collaboration to achieve satisfactory outcomes in building-related disputes.
Using determinations wisely: when to apply and when not to
Understanding when to use a determination is essential.
Here are some key points to consider:
Disagreements with authorities: You can apply for a determination if you disagree with a decision made by a building consent authority or territorial authority under the Building Act or Building Code.
For instance, if you receive a notice to fix or if the authority refuses to issue a building consent, code compliance certificate, or certificate of acceptance, a determination may be appropriate.
Not a mediation service: While determinations are increasingly sought after due to communication breakdowns, they are not a mediation service. Parties unable to communicate professionally should seek other avenues for resolution.
Limitations of Determinations
Resource Management Act: Determinations cannot address matters related to the Resource Management Act (except under Section 224(f), which pertains to specific subdivisions).
Contractual disputes, damages, and liability: Determinations do not cover contractual disputes, nor do they attribute liability nor award damages.
Council decisions: Determinations are not intended as an alternative pathway for decisions made by councils. However, a determination can confirm, reverse, or modify decisions made by council.
Workmanship Disputes
Determinations are not suitable for disputes related to workmanship. Workmanship disputes may be resolvable under the Construction Contracts Act 2002.
Complex or technical matters: Determinations commonly deal with complex or technical issues. The information given by parties to the dispute is assessed and the relevant regulations applied to the facts. The outcome is a legally binding decision. For example, a determination might uphold, reverse, or modify a council’s decision, such as refusing to issue a building consent, or determine whether building work is compliant.
Remember, choosing the right approach depends on the specifics of each situation. As professionals, you play a crucial role in ensuring fair and effective dispute resolution in the construction industry.
Navigating disputes determinations and effective resolution
Understanding the right steps in dispute resolution is crucial. Here’s what you need to know:
Prioritise practical solutions: Before seeking a formal determination, consider practical approaches to address routine complications and standard issues. Initiate with direct problem-solving methods and consult authoritative resources and precedents that offer guidance on comparable matters.
Check the facts: Gather accurate information.
Effective communication: Engage in clear, respectful communication with everyone involved.
Written agreements: Document any agreements in writing.
Mediation: When communication breaks down, consider mediation. An independent third party will assess the situation and helps people come to an agreement. It’s a constructive way to find common ground.
Code of ethics: As an LBP, adhere to your professional code of ethics. Act in good faith during dispute resolution, maintaining professionalism throughout the process.
Remember, choosing the right path depends on the specifics of each situation. Prioritise effective communication and ethical behaviour
to achieve fair outcomes in building-related disputes.
A determination example
A previous determination addressed an authority’s decision to grant a minor variation for the substitution of external wall cladding. The matter to be determined was whether the change in cladding required a formal amendment to the building consent and a new or amended certificate of design work.
The LBP who designed the plans argued for the necessity of accurate building consent documentation to reflect the actual construction, including any changes to the cladding system. They believed the authority significantly deviated from the approved consent, requiring revised plans and an amended certificate of design work.
The authority processed the cladding change as a minor variation without a formal amendment application, asserting that the designer’s certificate of design work remained applicable for the original consent.
The authority maintained that minor variations could be documented and added to the building file, transferring responsibility for compliance of Restricted Building Work to the authority post-consent.
The determination concluded that the application for a minor variation did not meet the requirements of sections 45 and 45A of the Building Act 2004, as it lacked a new or amended certificate of design work from an LBP with the appropriate design licence. Consequently, the authority’s decision to grant the minor variation was reversed.|
Using previous determinations as a resource
If you are considering a determination, it is worth looking through previous determinations about similar disputes. Finding a previous determination that has considered a similar issue may help you resolve your differences without having to go through the whole process.
However, it is important to note that determinations aren’t bound by decisions made in previous determinations, and two similar cases can have different outcomes as MBIE considers the unique circumstances of each case.
Previous determinations can also be a helpful resource when LBPs are unsure about a specific area of the Building Code or Building Act.

Reading Codewords articles that are relevant to your licence class is a mandatory requirement for Licensed Building Practitioners. These questions can be answered through the LBP portal, online on the Under Construction website or recorded on the magazine, then provided at the time of renewal.

In April 2021 MBIE sought feedback from Licensed Building Practitioners (LBPs) and those who engage with them on potential issues within the LBP scheme
MBIE asked for feedback on potential issues within three main areas of the scheme: LBPs‘ ability to supervise non-LBPs undertaking Restricted Building Work (RBW); licensing classes; and if the minimum standards of competency remain appropriate.
Overall, the feedback affirmed that the potential issues had been accurately identified and showed a high level of support for changes in these areas.
This feedback will be used to further strengthen the scheme to help ensure builders and designers have the right skills, knowledge and experience to do quality building work and increase consumer confidence in the scheme.
While the submissions highlighted instances where poor building work is happening, these instances are minor and the majority of LBPs and tradespeople are performing to high professional standards.
The LBP scheme is an important part of ensuring that building work meets the required standards, but it is also only one part of a wider system that delivers safe, durable and healthy buildings.
Who submitted? The consultation from April to June 2021 received 140 submissions across a wide range of occupations within the building and construction sector. Almost 50% of responses came from LBPs, with the other half from those who interact with them.
Supervision Someone who is not licensed under the LBP scheme may carry out RBW, provided they are supervised by an LBP licensed in that class of work. The supervising LBP is accountable for all work they supervise.
MBIE asked for feedback from LBPs and those who engage with them to determine if supervision is being executed poorly and, if it is, how widespread the problem is and whether improvements can be made.
Submissions confirmed that substandard supervision was happening, but were of the opinion it was not widespread.
The main issues raised were:
A lack of consistency in what good supervision looks like in practice, including perceived issues with remote supervision.
Some LBPs were supervising builders who had more specialist expertise but were not licensed, and were therefore not best placed to determine if the building work they were supervising complied with the building consent.
An LBP could be responsible for supervising non-LBPs doing RBW immediately after becoming licensed, without their ability to do so being tested.
Licence classes The LBP scheme currently has seven licence classes: Brick and Blocklaying, Carpentry, Design, External Plastering, Foundations, Roofing, and Site. These classes reflected the needs of the building sector at the time the scheme was introduced.
The consultation‘s questions on licence classes have been broken down into four main areas: Classes, Areas of Practice, Site Licence, and Licence Structure.
1. Classes Submitters mostly agreed that the licence classes already in the scheme should remain and advocated for additional classes that could be added.
The submissions identified that many problems within the scheme are caused by those who work with it but are not licensed in it, with 60% of submitters agreeing the scheme needed to regulate specialised non-LBPs in some way.
2. Areas of practice Currently, when an LBP becomes licensed in a class, they are required to demonstrate they are competent in one or more areas of practice in that class. They are not required to be competent in all the areas of practice for a class, and are not limited to working within only the areas designated on their licence.
While some respondents agreed that there were instances of LBPs working outside of their competencies, the overall consensus was that this was by a small minority of LBPs.
3. Site licence Most submitters were of the view that the Site licence is still a valuable part of the New Zealand building sector and that, when used as intended, provides a way for ensuring the entire build is being completed to the required standard.
Ideas for improvements were suggested to give the class a greater role in the current scheme:
Allowing only those with Site licences to supervise RBW; or
Modify the Site licence to be more like the Clerk of Works role that was prominent before the introduction of the LBP scheme, which would mean that the licence holder was more hands-on in the management of the site.
4. Licence structure The LBP scheme operates on a flat structure where, once licensed, those within the scheme are licensed at the same level as everyone else, regardless of differences in formal qualifications and length of time working in the trade.
An original objective of the scheme was to raise the overall skill level of those within it. A tiered licence structure could achieve this and would mirror other occupational regulation schemes, such as the Plumbers, Gasfitters and Drainlayers scheme and the Electrical Workers scheme.
Support was overwhelming for a tiered licence structure, with over 70% of submitters saying that the scheme should distinguish those based on experience and ability.
The majority of submitters cited that it would give experienced and capable LBPs an opportunity to separate themselves from those who have just entered the scheme.
Core competencies and minimum standards for entry Applicants to the LBP scheme must meet minimum standards for licensing to become an LBP, and existing LBPs must also meet minimum standards for continued licensing.
The consultation asked whether the core competencies and minimum standards were resulting in low confidence in the LBP scheme and whether they needed to be raised, as well as if qualifications needed to be made mandatory.
The majority of respondents (59%) were in favour of mandatory qualifications, with arguments that it was already overdue. Those who disagreed with mandatory qualifications thought people would miss out on becoming licensed because of this requirement, especially as there is already an avenue for these people to get certified and assessed to join the LBP scheme.
Next steps We will further investigate areas for improvement identified in the submissions, including the potential for a tiered licence structure. MBIE expects to develop proposals based on these submissions in 2022.

While reinforcing concrete foundation walls may not be the most challenging part of a build, it can often be a sticking point at inspection time. This article will provides some tips to get it right, the first time
NZS 3604:2011 Timber-framed buildings describes reinforcing for in-situ concrete and concrete masonry foundation walls with a piled foundation system supporting lightweight timber-framed construction (refer to paragraph 6.11.7 and Figures 6.13, 6.14 and 6.15 of the Standard).
Reinforcing generally consists of 12mm diameter deformed (D12) bars. The use of deformed bars, which have an irregular surface, creates a good bond between the reinforcing and the concrete. They are installed both horizontally and vertically at certain spacings depending on:
The height of the wall.
Whether the wall is in-situ concrete or concrete masonry.
Whether the wall is to support one or two-storey construction.
Whether the wall is cantilevered or not.
The details for reinforcing in-situ concrete and concrete masonry foundation walls are summarised in Table 1 and shown in Figures 1 and 2.
Reinforcing for foundation walls combined with concrete slab-on-ground floors
NZS 3604 contains examples of reinforcing for foundation walls combined with concrete slab-on-ground floors supporting light-weight construction (refer Figures 7.13(B), 7.14(B) and 7.14(C)).
The Standard also contains examples of the reinforcing if the combined foundation/concrete slab-on-ground floor also supports masonry veneer cladding (refer Figures 7.15(B), 7.16(B) and 7.16(C)).
The details for reinforcing combined footing/concrete floor slabs are summarised in Table 2 and shown in Figures 3 and 4.
Note that B1/AS1 Amendment 11 removed the untied slab/footing details in Figures 7.13(A), 7.14(A), 7.15(A) and 7.16(A) of the Acceptable Solution. All concrete slab-on-ground floors must now be reinforced and the slab reinforcing tied into the foundation wall reinforcing.
Laps and changes in direction
Where horizontal reinforcing bars change direction, and in other situations where they must be lapped, the overlaps must be a minimum of 500mm. At corners, the laps must be at least 500mm in each direction as shown in NZS 3604: Figure 6.15(a).
Lapped reinforcing should be tied with 1.6mm black annealed steel wire, which is soft and easily bent, at each end of the lap and at regular spacings in between.
Linking horizontal reinforcing bars
Where pairs of horizontal reinforcing bars are required in the footings of combined foundation wall/concrete slab-on-ground floors, they must be linked by stirrups. The stirrups are formed from the R10 reinforcing bars installed at 400mm centres and tied with steel wire ties at the junctions of the reinforcing and the stirrups (see Figure 4).
The bends in the reinforcing that form a hook or create a right angle must be at least five times the diameter of the bar, eg, the minimum bend diameter for 12mm diameter deformed reinforcing is 60mm.
Other reinforcing requirements
Other reinforcing requirements for foundation walls and footings include:
Stepped footings – these must have additional reinforcing in accordance with NZS 3604: Figure 6.12 (see Figure 5).
Where concrete or concrete masonry is against ground, reinforcing must have a minimum concrete cover of 75mm.
Openings in foundation walls larger than 300mm in any direction must have one D12 trimming bar on each side of the opening. These bars must extend at least 600mm past each corner of the opening. Where a lintel is less than 650mm deep, the jamb trimming bars must be bent over 60mm from the top of the concrete.

As promised, Under Construction will be including all compulsory Codewords articles to help LBPs earn their required points and stay up to speed with changes. This month’s article is required for all LBP licence holders
Under the new skills maintenance scheme, reading Codewords articles relevant to your licence and answering the corresponding questions is a mandatory part of skills maintenance (for those who have renewed their licence since 2 November 2015). Once you’ve read the article, go to the LBP website (under Codewords Issue 76) to answer the associated questions.
Understanding Supervision
The Building Practitioners Board (the Board) recently issued a significant complaint decision relating to supervision of building work provided by LBPs. You can read the decision about complaint number C2-01143 on the LBP website ( www.lbp.govt.nz ). While we have covered supervision in earlier issues of Codewords, this decision provides further important information for LBPs.
In C2-01143, the complaint against the LBP was about the poor level of supervision they provided to others. The Board upheld the complaint and the LBP was disciplined.
While the work involved was not carried out under a building consent, the LBP had undertaken to supervise and control the work of others and the Board decided the LBP could be held accountable for their actions.
As part of the complaint decision, the Board provided a breakdown of some of the major considerations, which LBPs should bear in mind when they are supervising work.
Supervise, in relation to building work, means provide control or direction and oversight of the building work to an extent that is sufficient to ensure that the building work:
(a) is performed competently; and (b) complies with the building consent under which it is carried out.
The boards major considerations are:
1. Supervision applies to all building work supervised by an LBP
LBPs can be held to account for building work done under their supervision. Even if there is no requirement for a building consent, it must be performed competently. If there is a building consent then it must also comply with the building consent.
2. Type and complexity of the building work to be supervised
Some types of work are inherently riskier and more complex than others. Generally, the more complex and risky the work, the more supervision is needed to ensure that work is carried out competently.
For example, you would provide more support to, and supervision of, someone carrying out the construction of a multiplaned roof structure than someone building a standard gable-end roof.
3. Experience of the person being supervised
The degree of supervision required depends on the ability of the person you are supervising.
A first-year apprentice requires more, and closer, supervision than someone who has been working in the trade for many years. You might work on site every day with the apprentice but visit other experienced and skilled or semiskilled staff a few times each week or at key points in the building work.
4. Supervisor’s experience in working with the person being supervised and confidence in their ability
While similar to the previous consideration, this relates more to the supervisor’s confidence in their coworker’s ability. It may be that you have a fourth-year apprentice who has shown they are very cautious and careful compared to a semi-skilled co-worker who rushes their work and doesn’t take time to read plans properly.
Although the apprentice has been working for less time, you might have more confidence in their ability to work without direct supervision and, as a result, spend less time with them. Similarly, if you have observed someone performing a task competently on more than one occasion, then it is more likely they will be able to do this again without direct supervision.
It is always good to take a conservative, risk-based approach until you have developed a good grasp and understanding of the ability of the people you are supervising. It is also important to consider which parts of the job are more complex and will need more supervision.
5. Number of persons or projects being supervised
As is noted above, supervising others means you are directly responsible for ensuring their work is performed competently and to the building consent, if there is one. As a supervisor, you need to be able to provide each worker or each project with a sufficient level of supervision to ensure that the work is carried out competently.
However, there are obvious limits on how much work can be adequately supervised and supervisors need to be aware when they become too busy to provide good support for those they’re supervising.
6. Geographic spread of the work being supervised
Supervision mostly involves direct site contact with co-workers and observation of the building work taking place. There might be occasions where some supervision can be undertaken remotely (by phone for example), but generally a supervisor should have regular direct contact at the site and with the people they are supervising.
Consider the geographical spread of your work – if you have jobs in Auckland, Wellington and Napier, it’s going to be difficult to provide adequate supervision to all these jobs given the physical separation of these sites.
7. The compliance of the building work
Ultimately, most complaints about LBPs include concerns as to whether the building work has been performed competently and meets the requirements of the building consent, if there is one. If there are multiple or serious noncompliance issues, then supervision of that work will come under close scrutiny. The supervising LBP may be disciplined, fined or lose their licence.
Conclusion
If you are supervising someone, ensure you are providing sufficient support for the people you are supervising for the work that they undertake, and that you can be there when needed. You need to have good business practices in place so that those you are supervising are able to reach you when they need support or clarification. If you are not able to provide the required level of supervision to your workers, you may need to engage another LBP to supervise or upskill some of your staff to become LBPs.

Paul Hobbs looks forward to further developing the LBP programme
In July, the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) appointed Paul Hobbs as the new Registrar of Building Practitioner Licensing.
With 20 years’ experience in the building industry, Paul has worked for MBIE, and formerly the Department of Building and Housing, for the past six years. Most recently, he was national manager for the Weathertight Services Group and played a key role in the Canterbury earthquake recovery work for the Building System Performance team, within MBIE.
As Registrar, he will work with the Building Practitioners Board to help recognise, support and promote professional skills and behaviour in the building industry. His experience, regulatory knowledge and technical skills will be particularly relevant to this important statutory role.
Under Construction had the opportunity to ask Paul about his plans going forward:
These four categories broadly represent the core skills or competencies an LBP should strive to uphold in order to maintain current competence in their given license class. However, a review of skills maintenance is currently under way, so things could change slightly. MBIE has been working with LBPs to understand how they are finding the current scheme and to develop a range of possible changes to skills maintenance. A significant amount of work has already been undertaken in this area, some of which includes:
Completing a telephone survey of LBPs and asking them a range of questions about their experiences regarding skills maintenance.
Undertaking workshops with LBPs, to gain a better understanding of their experience of skills maintenance.
Carrying out a web-based survey of LBPs, who have not applied to have their licence renewed, to understand what may have contributed to their decision.
Meeting with a range of sector representative groups to gain their views on skills maintenance in a general sense.
Identification of possible changes to skills maintenance is due to be completed by the end of September 2014. If the changes we want to pursue require legislative change (including changes to the LBP Rules), the Building Practitioners Board, followed by the Minister’s agreement to consult on the changes, will be sought.
The scheme has led to some 23,771 LBPs holding 28,768 licences (as some LBPs hold more than one licence class). Occupational licensing of LBPs has created minimum competency requirements that the sector must meet in order to undertake or supervise Restricted Building Work. The scheme has also seen many trade and other building-related associations lift their game in respect of training and upskilling staff.
The formation of the scheme has also provided a better opportunity to communicate with the various types of practitioners that form the scheme, as we now know who they are and what areas of work they undertake.
I’m passionate about the building sector and, in particular, the technical and legislative aspects of the building control system. My 20-odd years in the sector have seen me develop a strong understanding of the technical and regulatory areas of building control and, as a result, I saw this role as a good fit. I’ve always maintained a strong connection to the core skills due to my experience working as a carpenter, construction manager and building surveyor, and enjoy working with the various groups and individuals who make up the sector.
It promises to be a challenging, but rewarding role.

Have your say on the Building (Earthquake-prone Buildings) Amendment Act 2016 – consultation is now open and submissions due by 15 December
A s reported in Under Construction August, the Building (Earthquake-prone Buildings) Amendment Act 2016 was enacted by Parliament in May 2016. MBIE is now consulting on proposals for regulations and a methodology that will support the new legislation when it takes effect. Read more to find out about the legislation itself and see below to find out what MBIE is looking for submission on.
The Amendment Act addresses problems with the current system for managing earthquake-prone buildings under the Building Act 2004, identified by the Canterbury Earthquakes Royal Commission as part of a comprehensive government review. It also takes account of the views of the many submissions made during the development of the legislation.
The Amendment Act standardises the rules and processes that apply to identifying and remediating earthquake-prone buildings.
It avoids a ‘one size fits all’ approach, prioritising geographical areas and buildings that pose the greatest risk to life. It also ensures the government’s response is proportionate to risk, costs are minimised and New Zealand retains as much of its built heritage as possible.
Under the new legislation:
The threshold for defining an earthquake-prone building remains, with amendments to clarify certain aspects (including that it applies to parts of buildings).
New Zealand is categorised into areas of high, medium and low seismic risk (with timeframes for identifying potentially earthquake-prone buildings of five, ten and 15 years, and timeframes for strengthening earthquake-prone buildings of 15, 25 and 35 years, dependent on the seismic risk of the area).
The new legislation:
Excludes certain buildings (including most residential buildings).
Establishes a new methodology for identifying earthquake-prone buildings (set by the chief executive of MBIE). The EPB methodology will further target buildings that pose the greatest risk, and proposals for which buildings will be targeted are being consulted on.
Prioritises earthquake-prone education buildings, emergency service facilities, certain hospital buildings and buildings located on strategic routes (if identified by territorial authorities), by requiring that in medium and high-seismic risk areas they are identified and remediated in half the standard time. Where sufficient vehicle and pedestrian traffic could be affected, certain parts of unreinforced masonry buildings (such as parapets or verandas) in areas of medium and high-seismic risk will also be prioritised.
Introduces a new requirement to remediate earthquake-prone buildings early, when substantial alterations are undertaken. Proposals for a regulation for substantial alterations are being consulted on.
Provides for an opt-in extension of up to ten years to remediate Category 1 listed heritage buildings and buildings on the National Historic Landmarks List.
Provides for opt-in exemptions from the requirement to remediate for some buildings, on a case-by-case basis. Proposals for a regulation for exemptions are being consulted on.
Provides for a publicly available national register of earthquake-prone buildings and enhanced notices to be issued to help the public better differentiate between such buildings and encourage owners to remediate them. Proposals for regulations to establish earthquake-rating categories and to set the form of EPB notices are being consulted on.
MBIE is consulting on regulations in the following areas:
Defining the meaning of ‘ultimate capacity’. This will clarify the level of seismic performance required to help councils determine whether a building is earthquake-prone.
The criteria for the level of other building work that will trigger the need for early seismic strengthening to be carried out.
Specifying the characteristics earthquake-prone buildings must have to be considered for exemptions from the requirement to undertake remedial work.
Establishing an earthquake rating system that provides a measure of a building’s expected performance during an earthquake.
The appearance of public notices describing an earthquake-prone building’s level of seismic risk.
NEWSFLASH: ASBESTOS BAN
A ban on the import of all products containing asbestos, including building products and materials, came into force on 1 October 2016 under the Imports and Exports (Restrictions) Act 1988.
Under the ban, importers will need to understand and follow the rules and confirm their imports do not contain asbestos.
The ban will bring New Zealand’s regulations into line with many other countries, including Australia and the European Union.
The manufacture and importing of raw asbestos is already banned in New Zealand under the Hazardous Substances and New Organisms Act 1996, although under the Act products containing asbestos were still able to be imported for a range of uses.
A 2014 inventory by the Ministry for the Environment (MFE) showed alternative products are available in most cases. However, from 1 October 2016, if exceptions to the ban are required, for example if there are no suitable alternative products, importers can apply to the Environmental Protection Authority (EPA) for a permit, but only in limited circumstances.

MBIE’s new consumer protection guidance for builders details new regulations
New consumer protection measures, included in the Building Amendment Act 2013, came into force on 1 January 2015.
According to MBIE, the new measures have been adopted in response to consumers having little ability to distinguish between practitioners who have a good business history and repeatedly turn out quality building work, and those who use low-skilled labour, take shortcuts and do not stand behind their work. This type of behaviour creates an imbalance in the sector, as poorly performing practitioners often experience competitive advantage over their better-performing counterparts.
MBIE suggests that this is largely due to consumers often selecting building contractors on the basis of price alone, with little value placed on a practitioner’s overall credentials and in-service track record. The Government seeks to rebalance this lack of transparency through the implementation of the new consumer protection measures.
“When you’re pricing a job, the price should be the total cost of all the building work plus GST, regardless of whether all or part of the work is being done by a subcontractor
To outline the new measures and reiterate other changes that have occurred over the past two years, guidance has been released. It is divided into four parts:
New consumer protection measures
Before building work starts
Once building work finishes
What if things go wrong?
Under Construction will feature this content over the next few editions, as well as the ‘Guide to Tolerances’ when it is released later in the year.
Written contracts are mandatory for higher value work
From 1 January 2015, you must provide a written contract for residential building work costing $30,000 or more (including GST) whenever you have been given the job directly by the homeowner. If you are a subcontractor reporting to a main contractor, the new requirements do not apply to you – no matter the value of your work. MBIE encourages you to provide a written contract even if the building work will cost less than $30,000. Having a written contract helps protect you in case of a payment or quality dispute – it means you have a written and signed record of how much your client has agreed to pay for the building work provided with specific terms and conditions relevant to the project.
Who is responsible for providing a written contract?
Any person or business that contracts directly with the homeowner is responsible for providing a written contract if the building work will cost $30,000 or more. You can be fined $500 for not having a written contract with the homeowner when you are required to.
Calculating the cost
When you’re pricing a job, the price should be the total cost of all the building work (including supplies, fixtures and fittings) plus GST. This is regardless of whether all or part of the work is being done by a subcontractor. The cost of the subcontractors’ work can only be excluded if the subcontractor enters into a separate contract with the client. Attempting to avoid your obligations by splitting work into separate contracts of less than $30,000 will not be to your advantage. A written contract protects you as much as it does the client.
What to do before signing the contract
From 1 January 2015, you must give your client a disclosure statement with information about your business and a standard checklist before agreeing a residential building contract if:
The building work will cost $30,000 or more (including GST) or
The client has asked for these documents.
NOTE: You can be fined $500 per offence for not supplying homeowners with a checklist or disclosure statement if you are required to.
Standard checklist
The standard checklist has been prepared by the Ministry and includes information on how the building project will be structured and managed, having a written contract, and resolving disputes. This is a standard document that you can easily print or email to clients directly from www.doyourhomework.co.nz .
Remember, you must not make any changes to the checklist (ie you cannot add your business logo or contact details) and you must give your client a copy of it.

The Building Practitioners Board continues to suspend and fine LBPs who are not up to standard
The Licensed Building Practitioner (LBP) scheme aims to ensure that people in the building industry are competent and accountable, so that homes and buildings are designed and built right the first time.
To maintain the credibility of the scheme, those who are licensed must uphold that standard. The Building Practitioners Board (BPB) provides a forum to hear complaints about the conduct and quality of building work carried out by LBPs to ensure that happens.
“Having the BPB deal with complaints in a timely and professional manner is essential to instilling and maintaining homeowners’ confidence in the brand,” says LBP registrar Paul Hobbs. “The LBP scheme is still fairly young, compared to other occupational licensing schemes operating in New Zealand, and this forum is important to help it develop and mature.”
The Board recently disciplined two LBPs for not building in accordance with consent and having a general lack of understanding and knowledge.
Shamsher Ali of Auckland appeared before the BPB earlier this year defending a complaint relating to his conduct as an LBP. The Board found that Mr Ali held a cavalier attitude towards Building Code compliance matters and was not accepting of his legal obligation to build in accordance with the approved building consent. As was pointed out in the BPB’s decision, the process of issuing a building consent provides for independent inspection and verification of the consented building work to ensure it meets the performance requirements of the Building Code. The building consent process provides a level of protection for owners and the public; those working outside the rules should take heed of this decision.
“LBPs are personally responsible for keeping up to date with regulatory and technical changes relevant to their area of practice
Mr Ali’s licence was suspended for a period of 12 months and he was ordered to pay costs of $1500.
In a separate case, the Board found that Fangning Ai of Wellington made a number of building-related errors that were disproportionate to what would be expected of an LBP holding a Site 1 Licence. The errors demonstrated a general lack of understanding and knowledge of the regulatory system, the Building Code and applicable technical standards. Given these factors, the Board considered it appropriate to suspend Mr Ai’s licence for a period of six months. Mr Ai was also ordered to pay costs of $1000.
LBPs have a legal obligation to follow plans and specifications that form part of a building consent application. Any significant deviation from the consented documentation should be dealt with through a formal amendment or a minor variation to the consent. LBPs are also personally responsible for keeping up to date with regulatory and technical changes relevant to their area of practice.

Elective learning has been a part of the LBP skills maintenance programme since it was introduced. Learning and retaining skills and knowledge; however, has always been integral to building – even before the LBP scheme began
Some LBPs find the formal process of meeting criteria and submitting a skills maintenance record a daunting task at first, but it’s generally a natural learning process that just needs to be recorded. In this article, we offer tips for maximising the benefit to your professional development.
Start early
Your skills maintenance record is due every two years; however, there is no reason why you can’t start early! Giving yourself time to complete your elective skills maintenance allows you to pick which activities will best suit your needs. Some elective activities are one-off events, have limited numbers, or are run infrequently, so keeping an eye out can be worthwhile.
Core competencies
A good elective activity is one that provides valuable and meaningful content to help you maintain your professional skills and knowledge. When choosing elective activities, consider how they will help you build on your core competencies as an LBP. These competencies include:
Regulatory knowledge – knowledge about the Building Act, the Building Code, and other related regulations.
Technical knowledge and skills – knowledge about relevant construction methods and practice; understanding of Acceptable Solutions and other compliance pathways.
Health and safety – applying safe working practices and managing of hazardous substances and environmental issues on site.
Continued practice – developing skills relevant to your licence class or work.
Professional skills – knowledge of construction management, contract administration and good communication practices; understanding of relevant business training, quality assurance procedures and supervision of staff.
Types of activities
The range of suitable elective learning activities is deliberately broad to give you the flexibility to choose what will be of most value to you. The most important thing is the value of the learning, not necessarily how it is achieved. Types of activities may be:
• Presentations and tutorials. • Reading a trade magazine or other relevant publication. • Courses and other formal studies. • Lecturing and teaching. • Publishing professional articles or research. • Performing a service to the industry. • Learning about workplace safety. • Mentoring.
Choosing a training provider
An elective skills maintenance activity doesn’t have to be run by an accredited training provider or polytechnic. Some providers may advertise that their offering will be worth a certain number of skills maintenance hours. This can be helpful as a guide; however, the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) does not accredit courses as part of the LBP scheme, so it is not an endorsement or guaranteed learning outcome.
It comes down to your judgement whether you think you achieved quality professional development, and how many hours were relevant to your LBP competencies. This will vary from person to person, as some LBPs will have more or less experience in certain areas. It may pay to shop around for elective activities that will deliver the best learning outcomes for you personally, before investing your valuable time and money.
Record as you go
Recording your elective skills maintenance as you complete it is easier in the long run than racing to collate it when it’s due. You are also more likely to remember to add impromptu learning that might occur. Luckily, there are tools to help you do this, such as the online portal on the LBP website.
If you log in to the LBP portal, you can add your skills maintenance activities as you do them. The information is stored directly with MBIE, so it is all there when you are ready to renew your licence.
You may prefer to keep a diary of your skills maintenance activities elsewhere online. This could be on another website or in an app. If so, you can upload an exported PDF or JPEG copy of your completed skills maintenance record to the LBP portal when you wish to renew your licence. You can also scan a paper version of your skills maintenance record and upload it this way.
This article is an excerpt from Codewords Issue 91. Reading Codewords articles that are relevant to your licence class is a mandatory requirement for Licensed Building Practitioners. These questions can be answered through the LBP portal, online on the Under Construction website or recorded on the magazine, then provided at the time of renewal.

Call it cheesy, call it corny, call it what you will – we only have one life, so it’s important to take care of it!
Blue September is all about making the most of life by ensuring you get checked and, if necessary, treated before it’s too late. The Prostate Cancer Foundation’s annual appeal to raise awareness of men’s health is something that PlaceMakers, as principal sponsor, PlaceMakers has been heavily involved with for years.
However, despite all the events we’ve hosted and money we’ve helped raise, the message isn’t reaching as far as we’d like – one or more men are still dying every day from prostate cancer, which can be treated if detected early enough.
If looking after yourself for your own sake isn’t enough of an incentive, think about how illness could affect those you care about and/or your business.
On page 6, every builder we interviewed about their work/life balance touches on the importance of having time for family and friends. On page 26, Builtin looks at how loss of income due to illness is a common issue in this country – in fact, out of every 1,000 builders off work through disability, 900 will be laid up due to illness, not accident.
While there are ACC options to cover you in this instance, the best approach would be to also avoid illness, such as prostate cancer, wherever possible. If you’ve attended one of our Blue September events – which you can read more about on page 10 – you are hopefully aware of the danger, and we consider that a foot in the door. However, do everyone you care about a favour and take it a step further – go get checked!
In other news, we are pleased to announce that our new Under Construction website is live, and that the popular PlaceMakers Apprentice Crew is now open to all building and construction apprentices. Read more on pages 5 and 7.

On average, New Zealanders spend 75% or more of their time at home – yet surveys of New Zealand homes show they are cold and damp, the perfect conditions for mould, which thrives in humidity greater than 70%.
A dry home is all about ventilation, stopping moisture getting in and removing the sources of moisture.
Much of a home’s ventilation depends on its design – how it is oriented and the number and placement of windows.
If you’re the owner’s first point of contact,ensure they’re aware of the importance of ventilation; if the design doesn’t call for it, ask the designer why it’s missing.
Considerable moisture is generated by simple household activities. A shower, for example, can produce 1.5 litres each time it’s used. This moisture evaporates into the air and, if not removed, can contribute to condensation and mould.
“A dry home is all about ventilation, stopping moisture getting in and removing the sources of moisture
The most significant sources of moisture in a home come from the kitchen, bathroom and laundry. All these rooms should have mechanical extract ventilation (extractor fans or range hoods) to remove moisture.
Ensure you vent to the outside and not into the roof space, as that will allow moisture to accumulate and damage the insulation and internal roof structures.
Range hoods should extract to the outside, rather than recycling air, as recycling simply removes food smells but not the moisture from cooking.
Extract ventilation is so straightforward that it’s often not top of mind when thinking of home performance.
However, providing your clients with effective means to extract moist air from their home is a simple way you can contribute to their health and enjoyment in years to come.
Tips for effective extractor fans and range hoods:
Choose the right-sized fan for the job. A fan that’s too small won’t remove enough moist air to keep the home dry. A fan that’s too large can create draughts. Minimum requirements for extractor fan performance are set down under the Building Code.
Install models with automatic controls, such as a timer, which runs for ten minutes after it is turned off.
Combined light/extract units are often not very effective ventilators, as the light unit usually reduces the extract rate – select separate units.
Locate the extract inlet as close as possible to the moisture source – for example, close to the shower if it’s in a bathroom.
Locate the outlet vent away from windows – otherwise the moist air will just blow back in if the window is open.
Pay attention to the ducting – straight ducting is much more effective than ducting which has kinks or goes around a corner.
Ensure the weather grill shuts properly, so that there isn’t too much heat loss when the fan’s not in use.
With range hoods, it’s important that the hood covers the whole stove – and isn’t too far away from the elements. If it’s a smaller size than the stove, or very high above the elements, then it won’t work.
Beacon Pathway is a group committed to transforming New Zealand’s homes and neighbourhoods through research and demonstration projects that show how to make homes more resource efficient, healthier to live in, adaptable, resilient and affordable.

A fter conducting four rounds of PlaceMakers skills maintenance training, presenter Paul Alsford has a positive outlook on where the building industry is headed.
“I firmly believe that licensing and Restricted Building Work changes are being increasingly well understood, and dealt with, by LBPs as part of their business,” says Paul.
“There seems to be a positive relationship between LBPs and local councils, and skills maintenance is becoming an important part of the building industry.”
To sum it up, Paul says the industry is growing in its professionalism and LBPs are showing their willingness and ability to deal with change and new developments. He recommends five areas of focus:
1) Go online: There are so many resources available through the web. Getting information and keeping up to date on everything from regulations to business services to technical information online is now standard.
Use the shortcuts you wrote down at the latest skills maintenance seminar to access those sites more quickly!
2) Your own record keeping: While this isn’t a legal requirement, it’s for your own benefit and worth the effort. If you’re not already, take photos and keep a daily site diary. Back it up with written contracts and, when required, the Record of Work memorandum is a very good way to record building work you’ve done or supervised.
Remind yourself – if in three years I needed to check what happened on a job today, what would I rely on?
3) Business skills: Since so many of you are business owners, keeping your business processes organised is key.
However, don’t try to do everything yourself; use experts – from a tax agent to insurance broker – to help you.
If you have employees or apprentices who may go down the same business track one day, help them out by ensuring they get the ‘business basics’ right up front.
4) Constant change: They say the only constant is change. If you accept that, and realise it’s part of your job to stay up to speed, you will always be ready for whatever is coming next. To do this, use skills maintenance opportunities to your advantage – stay informed and be aware of changes as they come, particularly around compliance and regulations.
5) The ‘good no’: If a job you’ve been asked to quote doesn’t add up, or you’re not happy with how it might pan out, just say no and focus on the next (better) job! The ‘good no’ is better than a bad job.

TITLE   : CCAA retentions update

The government has introduced a bill clarifying that new legislation relating to retention money in construction contacts will not apply to contracts signed before 31 March 2017
T he Construction Contracts Act (CCA) 2002, which covers both commercial and residential construction contracts, provides a process for dealing with payments and disputes under a construction contract.
In December last year, the Construction Contracts Amendment Act (CCAA) 2015 was passed, amending the Act in three areas in a staged process:
Removing the differences between residential and commercial contracts (already in place).
Design, engineering and quantity surveying work to be included in the Act (from 1 September 2016).
Retention money withheld under commercial construction contracts must be held on trust (from 31 March 2017).
Providing more clarity
In late October 2016, the government introduced the Regulatory Systems (Commercial Matters) Amendment Bill, clarifying that the retention money provisions referred to in the CCAA 2015 will apply only to contracts entered into or renewed on or after 31 March 2017.
Under the CCAA 2015, retention money withheld under commercial construction contracts will be required to be held on trust. This will better protect retention money owed to contractors and subcontractors in the event of a business failure.
The Bill addresses concerns that the new law relating to retention money would have applied to existing contracts as well as new contracts – making it clear that the new law does not and will not apply to existing contracts.
This new trust requirement provides greater certainty of payment for contractors and subcontractors owed retention money for work done by ensuring the money held in retentions is responsibly managed.
How will it work?
Where payers withhold retention money under a commercial construction contract, the retention money must be held on trust.
The payer becomes a trustee and the payee becomes the beneficiary.
The obligations of the payee holding retention money on trust end when:
Retention money is paid.
The payee to whom the money is payable agrees to give up their claim.
The money ceases to be payable by law: ie, the money ceases to be payable under the contract.
What can’t you do?
1) Prohibited contract provisions
You cannot include in a contract any terms designed to delay payment of retention money. Any such terms in a contract will be void.
Similarly, you cannot include any conditional payment provisions for retention money in a construction contract (known as pay-when-paid provisions). Conditional payment provisions have been banned since the Act came into force in 2003. The amendments make it clear that this ban also applies to provisions for payment of retention money.
NOTE : Payment of retention money cannot be conditional on anything other than the performance of the payee’s obligations under the contract.
2) Use of retention money
Retention money cannot be used for any purpose other than to remedy a payee’s breach of their obligations under the contract, such as fixing defective work.
What can you do?
Retention money:
Does not need to be held in a separate trust account.
May be mixed with other money: ie, it can be held in the same bank account as other money.
May be held in the form of cash or other liquid assets.
May be invested and interest earned can be kept provided the investment is in accordance with the trustee act 1956.
How must retention money be accounted for to meet the trust requirement?
Proper methods of accounting for retention money are now required. Parties holding retention money must keep proper accounts that correctly record all dealings and transactions in relation to the retention money and must make these records readily available to parties owed the money.
The accounting methods must comply with generally accepted accounting principles and be auditable.
Late payments, interest and fees in relation to retention money
Interest must now be paid on late payments of retentions at the rate agreed under the contract. If a rate has not been agreed, the default rate of interest specified in regulations (yet to be developed) will apply.
In the event of a payer’s insolvency, retention money will be protected. Retention money is not available for the payment of debts of any creditor of a payer and cannot be taken by a court order at the insistence of any creditor of a payer.
Regulations may, if necessary, prescribe:
The minimum amount of retentions that the new trust requirements will apply to.
Methods of accounting for retention money in addition to the requirements in the act.
The default rate of interest for the late payment of retention money that will apply where a contract does not provide a rate. Further information on the Amendment Act and retentions is available on the MBIE website www.business.govt.nz

Like restricted building work (RBW), prescribed electrical work (PEW) is governed by strict licensing regulations – here’s what you and your customers need to know
I n recent years, both LBPs and non-LBPs have been known to undertake prescribed electrical work. It’s important to note that this is illegal – only licensed electrical workers are permitted to carry out prescribed electrical work.
The one exception to this rule is that owner-occupiers of residential premises may carry out some types of electrical work without a licence.
What can homeowners do?
Work that can be done by the owner of the premises is listed in Regulation 57 of the Electricity (Safety) Regulations 2010 and includes:
Removing and replacing fuse links.
Connecting and disconnecting permanently wired appliances.
Moving switches, sockets and lighting outlets if they are wired with tough, plastic-sheathed cables.
Replacing switches, socket outlets, light fittings, ceiling roses, water heater switches, thermostats and elements.
Before a homeowner does any work themselves, however, they need to familiarise themselves with the Electrical Code of Practice 51 (external link).
Other than these exempt tasks, having electrical work undertaken by unlicensed tradespeople is not only unsafe, but illegal and you could be fined (if convicted) up to $10,000 if you:
Do prescribed electrical work while not licensed to do so.
Cause, intend to cause or may reasonably cause any other person to believe that you are licensed to do PEW.
Hold yourself or your company out as being licensed to do PEW.
What can you do on the building site?
If you need to use an electrical worker, you should check that they are licensed. You can check the public register for electrical workers or ask to see the electrical worker’s licence card before work begins. Having a current practising licence means that the electrical worker is up to date on current safety procedures and has access to electrical standards.
When work is finished, ask for a Certificate of Compliance and Electrical Safety Certificate. Electrical workers are required by law to certify particular work. The certification is a public assurance that the work has been carried out by an authorised person and that it complies with the safety requirements.
You can find out if an electrical worker is registered or licensed on the Electrical Workers Registration Board website.

MBIE’s new consumer protection guidance for builders details new regulations
New consumer protection measures, included in the Building Amendment Act 2013, came into force on 1 January 2015.
According to MBIE, the new measures have been adopted in response to consumers having little ability to distinguish between practitioners who have a good business history and repeatedly turn out quality building work, and those who use low-skilled labour, take shortcuts and do not stand behind their work. This type of behaviour creates an imbalance in the sector, as poorly performing practitioners often experience competitive advantage over their better-performing counterparts.
MBIE suggests that this is largely due to consumers often selecting building contractors on the basis of price alone, with little value placed on a practitioner’s overall credentials and in-service track record. The Government seeks to rebalance this lack of transparency through the implementation of the new consumer protection measures.
“It’s a good idea to make a master copy of your disclosure statement and then amend it for each individual job – this can save you time and money
To outline the new measures and reiterate other changes that have occurred over the past two years, guidance has been released. It is divided into four parts:
New consumer protection measures
Before building work starts
Once building work finishes
What if things go wrong?
Under Construction will feature this content over the next few editions, as well as the ‘Guide to Tolerances’ when it is released later in the year.
By law, if you are going to contract directly with the homeowner you must give them a disclosure statement that includes:
Your full legal name; whether you are trading as an individual, partnership or limited liability company; the address of your business and when it was formed; and contact information, including phone numbers and email address.
Information about the key contact person (eg the project manager or site foreman) who will be involved in carrying out or supervising the building work, including: their relevant qualifications, skills and experience; their LBP number (if applicable); and their contact phone numbers.
Information about insurance policies you have, or intend to have, for the building work. This must specify the amount of the cover and any relevant exclusions on policy coverage.
Information about any guarantees or warranties you offer in relation to the building work. This must include the period of time the guarantee or warranty is offered for and any limits or exclusions. If it is a product warranty, you must specify what products are covered. NOTE: If you have been hired by the main contractor, you do not need to provide this information.
Anyone who knowingly provides false or misleading information, or who knowingly leaves out information they are required to provide in the disclosure statement, is liable on conviction to a fine of up to $20,000.
It’s a good idea to make a master copy of your disclosure statement and then amend it for each individual job – this can save you time and money.
You can find a disclosure statement template online at www.doyourhomework.co.nz . You can use this to produce your own disclosure statement covering the requirements. Make sure you give a copy to every new client before the contract is signed if the building work will cost $30,000 or more, or if the client requests it.
If your business is not an individual, partnership or limited liability company, you will need to write ‘none of these’ against the relevant question and provide a description of your entity (eg a trust).
You can’t include other information in the disclosure statement, but you can provide additional information to your client about your business by attaching other documents.
Make sure you haven’t left anything out as this could cause a problem later on. If you provide false or misleading information, or knowingly leaving out information, you could be liable for a fine of up to $20,000.
Contact your insurance company for a copy of your insurance certificate, and then use this information to help complete your disclosure statement.
If you’re a bigger company and you don’t know who the key contact person will be at the quoting stage, provide this information to the best of your knowledge. Make sure you give your client an updated disclosure statement when you sign the contract, if the information has been updated or changed.
You can be fined $500 for not providing the disclosure statement, so make sure you get on to it for each and every client.

PlaceMakers’ cross-country seminars give builders the chance to continue their learning
With PlaceMakers’ seventh round of seminars in full swing, presenter John Tait is delving into a number of topics with builders across the country. From licensing, to consumer protection measures, John is packing plenty of valuable information into each event.
“While some of the content is aimed at the more senior members of building companies, it’s all important information and I strongly encourage business owners to bring their staff along,” says John.
He reviews the skills maintenance programme, how licensed building practitioners are handling its requirements and what can be learned from published complaints.
John will go into detail about the new consumer protection measures – set to come into force on 1 January 2015 – and how you can prepare yourself for the changes.
The seminar will also include information on recent report findings regarding consenting processes, fees and expectations, as well as focus on E3 – internal moisture , the importance of home maintenance and the credibility of producer statements.
“While some of the content is aimed at the more senior members of building companies, it’s all important information and I strongly encourage business owners to bring their staff along” – John Tait
Sika product specialists will also be doing a presentation about waterproofing applications and products.
Keeping up to speed on the industry’s regulatory changes and technical knowledge is an essential part of being a licensed building practitioner, so make sure to come out to the seminar nearest you!

Building consent authorities (BCAs) need to be ‘satisfied on reasonable grounds’ that building work will meet the requirements of the Building Code, before they can issue the building consent. This is not always as simple as comparing the plans with the performance requirements of Building Code
The Building Code is performance-based, meaning it states how a finished building must perform in its intended use, rather than describing how it must be designed or constructed. The Building Act provides several ways to demonstrate compliance:
• Acceptable solutions – specific construction methods that comply with the Building Code. The Building Code clauses generally have one or more acceptable solutions. • Verification methods – methods of testing, calculations, and measurements that comply with the Code. • Alternative solutions – where all or part of the building design differs from either of the above, and other ways are used to show how it complies with the Code.
Acceptable solutions and verification methods, if followed, must be accepted by a BCA as complying with the Building Code provisions. There are other paths that must also be accepted as compliant by a BCA, such as product certification, energy work certificates, and Determinations issued by the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE). However, when the design includes specifically designed or bespoke features (alternative solutions), which could affect how the completed building performs in its intended use, the designer needs to show the BCA how that design will meet the performance requirements of the Code. The BCA needs to use its collective experience to determine compliance.
This is also the case when deciding whether to issue a Code Compliance Certificate (CCC). In fact, the CCC must include the declaration that the BCA is ‘satisfied on reasonable grounds’ that the building work complies with the building consent. Being satisfied on reasonable grounds means having enough evidence or justification to believe something to be true or valid.
If, for any reason, work is carried out differently on-site to what the designer detailed, it is important to involve the designer, so that they have an opportunity to make a new case for compliance. If the inspector finds that the detail on-site differs from that shown, they have no option but to fail the inspection. This could potentially lead to costly delays on-site.
Although the BCA is ultimately responsible for building consent outcomes, other parties play a key role in contributing to whether a BCA can be satisfied on reasonable grounds:
• Owners are responsible for obtaining consents, approvals, and certificates. • Designers are responsible for ensuring the plans and specifications are sufficient to result in the building work complying with the Building Code. • Builders are responsible for ensuring that building work complies with the building consent and the plans and specifications that relate to that consent.
MBIE has developed a guidance document, ‘Satisfied on Reasonable Grounds’. This guidance document aims to help improve understanding of what satisfied on reasonable grounds means and how to apply it. It also provides clarity for BCAs and assists them in achieving a consistent approach in applying the ‘reasonable grounds’ test.
The guidance is primarily for BCAs; however, it also provides helpful information and understanding for designers, builders, and owners in their various roles.

This article is an excerpt from Codewords Issue 121. Reading Codewords articles that are relevant to your licence class is a mandatory requirement for Licensed Building Practitioners. These questions can be answered through the LBP portal, online on the Under Construction website or recorded on the magazine, then provided at the time of renewal.

Two Licensed Building Practitioners (LBPs) can expect to have their names added to Santa Claus’ naughty list after the Building Practitioners Board found them guilty of serious offences in separate cases
A Christchurch-based LBP (Builder 1) had his licence cancelled after constructing habitable structures that contravened several parts of the Building Code on a vacant section he owned.
The buildings he erected did not meet the Building Code in terms of structural integrity, amenity or sanitation. In its decision, the Board referred to a High Court decision and stated:
“The Board considers the Court was envisaging that those who are in an integral positon as regards to building work, such as a Licensed Building Practitioner, have a duty to ensure a building consent is obtained (if required). It follows that failing to do so can fall below the standards of care expected of a LBP.
“The LBP has been found to have committed three offences, all of which are very serious. Moreover, there was a continuing pattern of conduct and a flagrant disregard for the requirements of the Building Act, and contempt for the Council and the Court’s processes when they took action.”
He was ordered to pay costs of $1,500 for what the Board considered a cavalier attitude toward Building Code compliance.
Big city blues
An Auckland LBP (Builder 2) also had his licence cancelled and was ordered to pay $2,000 for making a number of building-related errors disproportionate to what would be expected of someone holding his licence class.
The Board found that his errors demonstrated a general lack of understanding and knowledge of the regulatory system, the Building Code and applicable technical standards.
The complainant, Auckland Council, noted that the work subject to the complaint failed multiple building inspections. The building consent allowed 12 inspections to be undertaken over the course of the consent; however, 28 were booked.
Most of the failed inspections related to the weathertightness of the building’s external envelope. In relation to the compliance of the work undertaken by Builder 2, the Board stated:
‘The evidence provided to the Board showed clear instances of building work that had been carried out in a negligent manner, and the failings were sufficiently serious enough to warrant a disciplinary outcome. The failure to deal with weather tightness in the correct manner was particularly concerning to the Board.
“Ensuring weathertightness in buildings was one of the reasons why the LBP regime was brought into being.”
LBPs should not treat the building consent authority as their quality assurer, compliance verifier or overseer.
Regularly failing inspections is not a good look and LBPs might have to explain why the work they undertook or supervised did not pass a building consent authority’s inspection process.
Key points to take from these decisions
The above cases demonstrate that the Board will hold LBPs to account where they fail to meet the standards expected of them. They also highlight that a reasonable level of care, attention to detail and respect for the rules are required when carrying out building work, to ensure a quality finished product.
Consistently undertaking building work in a non-compliant manner is not a responsible, lawful, or acceptable position to take.
Knowingly undertaking building work that requires a building consent without obtaining one is viewed as a serious offence.

TITLE   : LBP Code of Ethics

Facebook

In October 2021, the Ministry of Business, Innovation & Employment (MBIE) introduced a Code of Ethics for Licensed Building Practitioners (LBPs), with a twelve-month transition period before they become enforceable
The Code of Ethics, which comes into force on 25 October 2022, sets behavioural standards for LBPs to give both the industry and consumers clarity on what is expected from LBPs, and to hold them to account.
Why have a Code of Ethics?
The Code of Ethics will ensure high standards are maintained in the industry, while giving the public more confidence that LBPs are reputable and operate ethically.
The majority of LBPs already work to the highest professional and ethical standards. Formalising this into a Code of Ethics aligns the LBP scheme with international best practice and provides clear grounds for the Building Practitioners Board (the Board) to take disciplinary action against practitioners who behave unprofessionally. The Board is able to issue fines or revoke licences where necessary.
Homeowners will be able to have greater confidence that, where they choose an LBP to undertake building work, those people are doing so in a safe, legal, and professional way, and that they will take responsibility for their work.
What does the Code of Ethics include?
The Code of Ethics is made up of nineteen standards, which sit under the following four key principles:
1. Work safely
Take responsibility for health and safety.
Report unsafe behaviour by others on a building site.
Avoid harming the environment.
2. Act within the law
Comply with the law.
Report breaches of the law.
3. Take responsibility for your actions
Know what building work you are allowed to do.
Explain risks to your client.
Inform and educate your client.
Be accountable for building work carried out by you, or someone under your supervision.
Advise clients of any delays as soon as they become apparent.
Act in your client’s interests.
Generally, you should follow your client’s instructions unless the instructions are dangerous, are contrary to contracts or consents, or would mean you would not be acting within the law.
4. Behave professionally
Behave professionally.
Act in good faith during dispute resolution.
Price work fairly and reasonably.
Declare and manage actual or potential conflicts of interest appropriately.
Maintain confidentiality of client details, unless there is good reason for sharing information.
Acknowledge and respect the cultural norms and values of your clients and colleagues.
Conduct your business in a methodical and responsible manner.
How was the Code of Ethics developed?
In April 2019, MBIE began work on the Code of Ethics as part of the Building System Legislative Reform Programme. In December 2019, the Minister for Building and Construction agreed to introduce a Code of Ethics, alongside other work to strengthen the LBP scheme.
In September 2020, MBIE consulted with key stakeholders and all LBPs on the proposals for the Code of Ethics. The consultation ran for eight weeks and reached out to approximately 26,000 stakeholders.
Over the course of the consultation period, MBIE received 79 written submissions, and engaged with 277 webinar attendees. MBIE took this feedback onboard and made changes to ensure the Code of Ethics met the Reform Programmes aims and the needs of the sector.
In mid-2021, MBIE made final adjustments to the Code of Ethics to make sure it would work in practice. The Code of Ethics was made by Order in Council on 26 October 2021.
What happens if the Code of Ethics are breached?
If an LBP does not comply with their obligations, a complaint can be made against them, which may result in disciplinary action by the Building Practitioners Board.
The Code of Ethics is not enforceable by the Building Practitioners Board until 25 October 2022. This means that complaints about someone breaching the Code of Ethics can only be made if the breach took place on or after 25 October 2022.

MBIE’s consumer protection guidance for builders details new regulations
New consumer protection measures, included in the Building Amendment Act 2013, came into force on 1 January this year.
According to MBIE, the new measures have been adopted in response to consumers having little ability to distinguish between practitioners who have a good business history and repeatedly turn out quality building work, and those who use low-skilled labour, take shortcuts and do not stand behind their work. This type of behaviour creates an imbalance in the sector, as poorly performing practitioners often experience competitive advantage over their better-performing counterparts.
MBIE suggests that this is largely due to consumers often selecting building contractors on the basis of price alone, with little value placed on a practitioner’s overall credentials and in-service track record. The government seeks to rebalance this lack of transparency through the implementation of the new consumer protection measures.
“A ‘contractor’ is any person or business contracted directly by the client to do residential building work (the construction, alteration, demolition or removal of a building), whether they are doing all or part of this work
To outline the new measures and reiterate other changes that have occurred over the past two years, guidance has been released. It is divided into four parts:
New consumer protection measures
Before building work starts
Once building work finishes
What if things go wrong?
Under Construction will feature this content over the next few editions, as well as the Acceptable Workmanship guide when it is released later in the year.
Provide a written contract for residential building work costing $30,000 or more (including GST) whenever you are given the job directly by the homeowner.
Provide a standard checklist to potential clients if they request it, or if the building work is likely to cost $30,000 or more (before signing a contract).
Give your clients a disclosure statement, including information about your skills, qualifications, licence status and the insurance or guarantees you provide in a disclosure statement before you sign a contract. You must provide this if the work will cost $30,000 or more, or if the client requests it.
Give your clients information about any ongoing maintenance requirements, insurance policies and guarantees or warranties once the building work has been completed.
An automatic 12-month defect repair period starts when the work has been completed. The contracting party must arrange to fix any defects they’ve been told about in writing.
The homeowner has new ways to take action when implied warranties in the Building Act have not been met.
You can be fined if you don’t comply with the law.
A ‘contractor’ is any person or business contracted directly by the client to do residential building work (the construction, alteration, demolition or removal of a building), whether they are doing all or part of this work.
‘Building work’ covers many different trades and is any work for, or in connection with, the construction, alteration, demolition or removal of a residential building. Note that ‘buildings’ include structures that are not occupied by people, such as fences and retaining walls.
Remember, all building work must comply with the Building Code, even if the work does not require a building consent. Check out updated guidance on work that does not require a consent at www.mbie.govt.nz .
The consumer protection measures are included in a new part of the Building Act 2004 (Part 4A) which comes into force on 1 January 2015.
Other changes came into effect in November 2013, including an updated list of work on homes and outbuildings that do not require a building consent (in Schedule 1 of the Building Act). More low-risk work has been exempted, but there are limits on who can do some potentially higher-risk work; for example, certain plumbing and drainlaying work can be done without a consent but only by authorised people (as defined in the Plumbers, Gasfitters and Drainlayers Act 2006).
NOTE: These changes relate to residential building work only.

The Government has announced there will be a public consultation in the coming months on a range of options to increase the uptake of remote inspections
Remote inspections are when building inspection activities are conducted remotely, using digital tools and technologies. Instead of visiting the site in-person, inspectors may, at their discretion, use live video streaming or review photographic evidence to assess the building work from their office, with the builder following their instructions onsite.
The use of remote inspections increased during the Covid-19 pandemic and has also been utilised when factors such as extreme weather has caused road closures, when heavy traffic can disrupt appointment times, or when the building site is in a remote location.
Remote inspections have been gaining further acceptance, with Building Consent Authorities (BCAs) using them to save inspectors
time on the road and reduce travel costs, provide business continuity and to ensure a timelier service to applicants.
Roles and responsibilities for inspections
The Building Act outlines the responsibilities of different parties involved in the building process under this Act, which includes:
The owner has overall responsibility for ensuring the building work complies. with the building consent and must ensure that they or their nominated representative enable inspections to be completed as required by the BCA.
The designer is responsible for ensuring that the plans and specifications or advice they give on compliance are sufficient, if followed onsite, to result in the building work complying with the Building Code.
The builder is responsible for ensuring that the building work is carried out in accordance with the approved plans and specifications.
The BCA is responsible for checking that an application for a building consent complies with the Building Code and that the building work has been carried out in accordance with that consent.
Benefits of the remote inspection process
Remote inspections benefit everybody involved in the inspection process.
Building consent authorities will be able to increase the number of inspections they carry out by eliminating travel time. This will also create cost savings in vehicle and travel expenses, minimise exposure to safety hazards onsite, help upskill inspectors, improve record management through high- quality digital records which are geographically stamped, and make it easier to share of resources with other BCAs.
Builders will get more timely inspections that are undertaken at a time that suits them, rather than relying on the inspector’s availability. They will also see cost savings in not having subbies being paid while waiting for an inspection, a shorter build process through reducing down-time waiting for an inspection, a better understanding of the building code requirements through gaining an in-depth understanding of what’s required for the inspection, and, of course, safety – fewer people onsite reduces the likelihood of accidents.
The wider building industry benefits through a collaborative approach, which assists in building trust and reduced environmental impact through reduced travel- related carbon emissions. Remote inspections also provide for business continuity and resilience for the whole building and construction industry.
New tools and considerations
The industry has developed a variety of tools to undertake remote inspections, which support the user to capture the information and evidence the inspector needs to check that the building work complies with the consent.
There are a number of considerations BCAs need to keep in mind with its remote inspection approach, including the building complexity and inspection types. They may use their data on inspection failures to determine which inspections and building types it would consider for the early stages of adopting remote inspections. It may be that builders that are known to have higher inspection pass rates would be preferred as early adopters for the BCA’s approach.
Another consideration is the skillset of both the inspector and the builder. The inspector will need to be proficient in the remote inspection tool the BCA adopts, particularly for the livestream inspections.
Similarly, the builder will need to be competent in using the chosen software and technology and have a good understanding of an inspector’s expectations. BCAs could use existing relationships to identify suitable builders for early remote inspection adoption.
More information about remote inspections can be found on building. govt.nz . Talk to your local council to find out if they are looking to remote inspection for the future if they are not already using this technology.
Further guidance from MBIE
MBIE has just released a guidance document for BCAs on the adopting and growing the uptake of remote inspections. Although this guidance is aimed at BCAs, it is also particularly relevant to Licensed Building Practitioners and other tradespeople, who participate in the inspection process. You can see the guidance document at building.govt. nz .
Learning how to use the particular tools the BCA adopt for remote inspections is also a relevant on- the-job learning activity for skills maintenance.

What if I said to you that people working on building sites up and down New Zealand are only able to identify up to 45% of the hazards that they are working amongst?
How about if I said that 35% of hazards are missed because of limitations in the way our brains process what we see, and 20% are missed because work is often unpredictable?
A recent US study measured hazard recognition in data collected from 4,800 worker-hours of field observations from 12 different construction trades and that’s exactly what they found.
Hazard recognition
Hazard recognition is vital for nearly every safety activity, including pre-task safety briefings, safety observations, risk assessments, and design reviews.
Most safety practices are built on the assumption that workers can see hazards that are there and can anticipate those that may arise from work.
In fact, inadequate hazard recognition appears as a contributory factor in around 50% of workplace incidents.
Because they appear so obvious after an event, people have often been wrongly blamed for being complacent or negligent.
Why some hazards are easy to identify while others are often overlooked
Let’s start with an example. There are 2 scenarios on the right hand page:
Scenario A
An unprotected exposure to a fall hazard over 5m.
An individual is placed at the edge and is asked to look down at the ground below.
Scenario B
An unprotected exposure to a 3m deep, clear-cut excavation wall of sandy-clayey soil.
An individual walks to the bottom of the excavation and is asked to reach out and touch the soil wall opposite the roller.
In scenario A, nearly anyone would identify that they are in a dangerous situation, and many would experience fear, anxiety, elevated heart rate, weakness in the legs, or even feel sick.
In scenario B, although the scenario is potentially fatal if the soil wall were to collapse, an individual may fail to understand the seriousness of the hazard.
Even well-trained workers are unlikely to experience the same intense emotional and physiological response as in Scenario A.
So why do we tend to have a physiological and emotional response to one but not the other?
The answer lies with our brain and how it processes information.
When we look at hazards that involve energy, such as gravity or motion, the instinctive part of our brain fires up.
That’s because human brains have evolved short cuts over very long periods of time to quickly recognise things in our environment that are a potential danger to us.
That same part of our brain also is responsible for our ‘fight or flight response’, which is why when we instinctively see such hazards, we tend to feel something.
Alternatively, hazards that are most commonly missed (eg, mechanical, pressure, chemical, biological) are processed in more advanced locations of the brain and require much greater effort to process the information.
What can we do about it?
As every injury is the result of the unwanted release of, and contact with, 1 or more energy sources, we can use energy categories to prompt our thinking.
To do this, we use the energy wheel: Each of the 10 icons in the energy wheel represent a different type of energy. See page 18.
Although not strictly scientific, the icons represent the most common ways that energy is present at work.
Examples of energy Hazards
Gravity: Force caused by the attraction of all masses to the mass of the earth.
Uneven work surface
Work at height
Unsecure materials
Motion: Change in position of objects or substances.
Traffic
Mobile equipment
Projectiles
Mechanical: Rotation, vibration, tension, or compression.
Augers
Cables
Grinder wheels
Electrical: The presence of an electrical charge or current.
Wires
Power lines
Power tools
Pressure: Liquid or gas compressed or under a vacuum.
Vehicle tyres
Piping systems
Hydraulic lines
Sound: Audible vibrations caused from the contact of 2 or more objects .
Heavy machinery
Power tools
Nail guns
Radiation: Elements that emit ions or atomic particles .
Welding
Sun exposure
X-ray testing
Biological: Living organisms that pose health or safety risks.
Bites and stings from animals
People (violence or aggression)
Toilets
Chemical: Reactive elements in the environment.
Cleaning products.
Engine exhaust
Silica dust
Temperature: Differences in thermal energy with the human body.
Friction
Engines
Steam
How do I use the energy wheel?
You can use this simple 2 step process:
To start, put the energy wheel away and recognize hazards using your instinct.
Then go around the energy wheel to see if you missed any hazards.
Points to note:
The energy wheel helps us to do what we already do better.
Do not identify hazards then try to classify them.
The name of an energy source (eg gravity) is not a hazard.
The energy wheel adds structure and strategy to pre-job safety briefs.
The energy wheel can help
provide clearer understanding of hazards and when change is a factor.
The energy wheel can support meaningful conversations and the sharing of knowledge experienced people gain over time, that isn’t normally written down.

In an industry that’s committed to building safer, healthier and more durable buildings, it’s inevitable that the regulations surrounding it continue to evolve in line with construction techniques and products.
T o support its customers in navigating these changes, PlaceMakers continues to offer opportunities for upskilling. This spring, PlaceMakers will once again be providing its builders the opportunity to get up to speed with industry changes – and earn elective skills maintenance points – by attending its next round of seminars.
“Ensuring that our customers can earn all their required elective skills maintenance points through PlaceMakers initiatives is a key focus for us,” says general manager operations and marketing Gary Woodhouse. “We want to support our builders’ professional development and, in turn, the industry’s professionalism and competency as a whole.”
Health and safety focus
The new Health and Safety at Work Act continues to be very topical for our builders, so we’ll spend a bit of time on this. We are doing our best to provide our builders with relatable examples of the Act in practice; covering the key areas including collaboration, overlapping duties, PCBU’s, hazards vs risk management and myth busting.
In-depth look at LBP issues
While touching on the latest board complaints (e.g. number of complaints, outcomes and what the majority of the complaints are about compared to previous years), we will spend some time on one of the most common LBP complaints, namely “poor understanding and application of site supervision”.
This recently prompted the Building Practitioners Board to extend the definition of supervision for LBPs. During the seminar, we will run through various scenarios with attendees to ensure everyone is on the same page about what is and isn’t considered supervision.
Regulatory Updates
The seminars will also include reminders about recent regulatory changes, including the government’s response to the ‘loopy rules’ report, Residential Tenancy Act changes, the recent ban on retrofitting foil insulation and more.

The Health and Safety at Work Act 2015 requires everyone to play their part T he new Health and Safety at Work Act (HSWA) is now in effect. Whether you’re a business owner, employee or director, the information and tools you need are on the WorkSafe website and will be featured in Under Construction over the coming months.
Your ‘go to’ guide WorkSafe has prepared a guide to understanding the new health and safety law and how it will be regulated. It will be updated regularly, so visit the website to get the latest information.
Notifiable events As of 4 April, employers must notify WorkSafe when certain serious work-related injuries, illnesses or incidents (notifiable events) occur. Worksafe’s new online tool explains what’s notifiable under HSWA and makes understanding the process easier.
Worker engagement and participation Ensuring workers’ views on health and safety matters are asked for and taken into account is a significant aspect of the new way of thinking under HSWA. Having clear, effective and ongoing ways for workers to suggest improvements or raise concerns on a regular basis can benefit a business and workers in many different ways.
The latest guidance, titled Worker Engagement, Participation and Representation Good Practice Guidelines is now available on the WorkSafe website.
In context So, what will the new law mean in practice for builders and tradies ?
Check out WorkSafe’s description of how it might apply to your typical residential build below:
Just about the first job on any new building site is to put up a safety fence, do the foundation work and lay the slab. Once the slab is ready, it can get pretty hectic – with any number of tradies from any number of companies on site at any one time.
From the outside, to an untrained eye, it can look chaotic. But it needs to be organised chaos. All the parts need to work together to pull the project together.
It’s the same with health and safety. You need strong foundations and everyone needs to work as a team.
Take that typical new house build. There are lots of players involved – the client, maybe an architect, a lead contractor and all the subbies. Under the new Health and Safety at Work Act, they will all have a role to play in keeping not only their own workers safe on site, but others as well.
It’s called ‘overlapping duties’, but in practice what it means is that the person or business that is best placed to manage a risk that affects more than just their own workers has primary responsibility to do so. However, everyone has to play their part.
For example, on a house build, the company that’s contracted to dig the drains has a duty to ensure the excavator is operated safely – with proper measures in place to keep workers on foot away from the digger. But if the lead builder (let’s call them ABC Construction) has workers in the area too, they also have a duty to ensure their people are kept safe. So, there needs to be discussion and agreement between ABC and the drain layer about how the risks associated with the digger are being managed.
The law is designed to encourage cooperation on site. For example, all workers will need access to first aid gear. Given that ABC Construction is going to be there for the duration of the project, it’s likely they will provide first aid facilities.
The tiler that’s working on the bathroom for a couple of days needs to ensure they have access to first aid as well. But they don’t necessarily have to bring their own; they could do that by confirming they can use ABC’s gear if needed.
Whenever a new subbie turns up, there should be an induction process which includes discussion about current site hazards as well as any new hazards they might introduce. In fact, health and safety should be a feature of the tender process for work and there should be an exchange of any relevant information before subbies even arrive on site.
Many building sites already start the day with a tailgate or toolbox talk. Having open lines of communication between workers, supervisors and managers has always been a good idea. The new Act specifically encourages that sort of approach by introducing a duty to engage with workers that applies to all workplaces. It doesn’t set down in stone what form that engagement should take, but a quick daily chat about safety and hazards on site each day is a good place to start.
There are some new worker engagement rules for larger workplaces (with more than 20 workers) and those in high-risk industries, such as construction. These businesses are required to hold an election for a Health and Safety Representative (HSR) if requested by a worker.
They must also consider forming a Health and Safety Committee (HSC) if an HSR or five workers request one. You can read more about the role of HSRs and HSCs at the WorkSafe website.
Health and safety doesn’t have to be difficult and require a lot of paperwork. It’s about identifying risks, talking about them with everyone on site who might be affected, and finding appropriate ways to manage them.
Of course, not all risks can be eliminated – risk is part of life and will always be part of construction work. However, the key is doing what is ‘reasonably practicable’ to control and minimise those risks.
To do so, identify onsite risks, the likelihood of an incident and the consequences of them. Then introduce control measures that reflect the seriousness of the risk.
The introduction of the new law is a great opportunity to review your current approach to health and safety. Think of it as a core part of your business and any project. It’s not something you do once and file away on a shelf – make sure it is part of your daily routine.

As New Zealand’s population grows, our district plans and long-term planning rules change to ensure we build enough homes for our residents. In many areas of the country, these changes have resulted in a move away from the traditional standalone dwelling to higher density residential construction such as townhouses, terraced housing or apartments.
Sound insulation is a building element’s ability to reduce the
sound that goes through it. It is generally given in a single unit number as a
guide to its effectiveness at limiting sound transmission for example Sound
Transmission Class (STC) 55 and Impact Insulation Class (IIC) 55).
This single unit number is a summary of the element’s sound
insulation performance over a range of frequencies. It’s important to note that
the single unit doesn’t give you a full picture at all frequencies. For example,
an STC 55 timber wall won’t have exactly the same performance at all
frequencies as a STC 55 concrete wall.
There are generally two types of sound transmission to consider for buildings:
Airborne sound – noise originating in air, for example
voices, music, motor traffic, wind.
Impact sound – noise originating directly on a structure
by blows or vibration, for example footsteps above, furniture being moved,
drilling and hammering the structure.
For wall assemblies, sound insulation should also be thought of in two ways:
External sound insulation – limiting noise from outside the
building. This is generally provided by the building envelope.
Internal sound insulation – limiting sound transmission from within
the building, for example, inter-tenancy sound insulation or plumbing sound
insulation.
The minimum requirements for preventing sound transmission
through building elements are given in New Zealand Building Code Clause G6 Airborne and impact sound . Remember that
if you undertake building work, it must comply with the Building Code
regardless of whether it requires a building consent.
You can find Building Code Clause G6 on MBIE’s Building Performance website .
As a general rule, reducing sound transmission requires more mass or a separation of elements. Mass can be increased by using a thicker version of the same material or by using a denser material.
A range of factors need to be considered when selecting, installing or detailing noise control in wall, floor or ceiling assemblies (see the below table). Always keep to the design specification for building elements that contribute to the sound insulation, particularly around inter-tenancy walls.

Young people today; they don’t know what hard work really means! Ever thought this about your apprentices? Chances are, your boss thought the same when you were starting out in the job
Imagine waking up to a workday in the 1960s – it would be completely different to a regular working day in 2014. Just as the work environment has evolved, so have the attitudes and behaviours of the generations.
Most of the negative perceptions associated with Generation Y (those born 1980-2000) are caused by misunderstandings, rather than them simply being “no good”. Below we look at some Gen Y traits. Many employers with new apprentices will recognise these traits, but it’s important they also understand them.
Perception: This is a bid for attention, or a lack of know-how that irritates supervisors.
Reality: Eager to please, young people want to know they’re doing a good job. They want frequent feedback and guidance from their mentor.
Perception: They are over-confident and expecting fast promotion. They’re unwilling to pay their dues and think they know it all.
Reality: They want a meaningful, important job that pays the bills and gives them a sense of purpose. In regard to technology, they are up with the play.
Perception: They’re disrespectful and unable to show respect to authority.
Reality: They are data-driven and less concerned with emotion. They’re all about equal rights at every level.
Perception: Young people have a short attention span and are unwilling to put in the required time and effort.
Reality: Gen Y individuals are open to change and willing to work any time on their own schedule. They want and expect the freedom to choose.
Perception: This impatience, bordering on arrogance, shows they think they are more accomplished than they are.
Reality: In fact they are action-oriented, self-motivated and eager to achieve goals. They’re motivated by their own ideas, making an impact and are satisfied when their ideas have a quick impact.
Perception: Young people are coddled, unable to make decisions for themselves.
Reality: Gen Y is family-oriented; most individuals long to remain connected and think about the community at large, rather than just themselves.
Perception: They are narcissistic and self-obsessed, particularly online.
Reality: Instagram, Facebook, Twitter – these days everyone markets themselves and their personal ‘brand’ in order to stand above the competition. Gen Y has no choice but to invest in and develop an online presence.
Perception: They are disloyal and unable to stick with one thing for any length of time.
Reality: Gen Y is concerned with the work environment and doesn’t want to be taken advantage of. Individuals will put in the hours and work hard, but it’s important it’s in the right environment.
“Most of the negative perceptions associated with Generation Y (those born 1980-2000) are caused by misunderstandings, rather than them simply being ‘no good’
It’s important you understand these traits, because Gen Y employees will compose the majority of the construction workforce by 2025.
If you’re taking on a young apprentice or worker, assign them a mentor, provide ongoing training and give specific feedback, and give them a stake in your company’s outcomes by encouraging their ideas and questions.
On one worksite alone, there may be at least three different generations all working together. To ensure a harmonious environment, all generations need to understand one another, so that everyone’s ideas and opinions benefit the business, and the industry, as a whole.
In order to properly mentor the next generation of construction professionals, today’s industry leaders need to understand the Gen Y mindset to help groom the leaders of the future.

BCITO recently recognised a number of trades at its ‘Apprentice of the Year’ awards – acknowledging the valuable contribution required to build the houses Kiwis own and love
The top performer and overall winner was Hona Spratt, who worked his way up through the ranks at Braddock Decorators. He began his career during the school holidays working for pocket money. Now he’s a project manager with the company, is in charge of eight painters and responsible for delivering jobs on time and to a high standard.
“My painting apprenticeship has changed my life so much for the better,” said Hona. “I’m passionate about what I do and see a great future in this business for me.”
Coromandel flooring apprentice Stafford Moody, of Fagans’ NZ Ltd, Whitianga, won the Supreme Flooring Apprentice of the Year Award and was named BCITO Stage Three Flooring Apprentice of the Year.
The award was based on his performance at the Allied Trades Institute, while undertaking off-job training. Principal tutor Jeff Henry said: “Stafford worked tirelessly to hone his finishing skills and always showed good logic with his decisions.”
“It was a bit unexpected,” said Stafford. “There were two other classes and so you never know who is there and how good they are, but I’m very happy.”
David Irvine of Barrett Joinery Ltd, Timaru, received BCITO’s Ernie Jelinek Cup for the Most Promising Joinery Apprentice.
Anthony Bergman of Metro Performance Glass, Christchurch, was named the Most Promising Glass & Glazing Apprentice. Also presented at this event was the award for the Most Promising Architectural Aluminium Joinery Apprentice, won by Ashley Hooker of Frankton Aluminium Ltd.
Gillian Flynn of Kitchen Inspirations in Pukekohe was presented with the Judy Bark Cup and awarded the title of New Zealand’s Most Promising Design Student 2015.
BCITO values the opportunity to share in celebrating all high-achieving apprentices who aspire to be industries’ leaders of the future. These events are also a wonderful opportunity for BCITO people to catch up with employers and stakeholders around the country.

The new skills maintenance scheme seeks to help LBPs make the most of information acquired on the job
F ollowing the announcement of the new ‘mixed-model’ skills maintenance scheme in December 2015, a number of Under Construction readers made it clear they wanted more detail around on-the-job learning, which is one of two compulsory activities under the new approach.
Examples
LBPs will need to show at least two examples of on-the-job learning for their licence class over the two-year period. Each example can be a project where you have learned something new on the job that is relevant to your licence class. Examples include:
Design and/or installation of a new cladding.
Learning how to use a product or material you haven’t used before.
Describing how you did a job that was complicated by a particular terrain, wind zone, elevation, etc.
MBIE has developed an online Record of Work and Certificate of Work form, which LBPs can use to record their learnings as they happen. LBPs will also need to include completed work on the job, and/or problems or issues identified, and/or lessons learned, and/or new skills acquired and/or other relevant information.
What about me?
Despite the occupational licensing team’s attempts to explain on-the-job learning in detail, some readers are still unclear about how to apply it to their own work. Under Construction reader Wayne, who is a construction manager/ property developer, asked us to provide examples of what would qualify as on-the-job learning in his position.
Assuming Wayne holds a site licence, LBP senior technical advisor Stanil Stanilov advised the following:
“Select two projects over the two-year period and briefly describe how he managed the construction process on those. It doesn’t have to be a very detailed description, just the basic stages of construction and how Wayne carried out his site management role on the project examples.
“If applicable, he may also want to include any new learning he has acquired in the process related to regulatory and/or technical knowledge, health and safety or any other professional skills.”
If you’re unsure about how to identify and record your on-the-job learning, check out the more detailed completed example below.
Other examples are available at http://www.business.govt.nz/lbp

PlaceMakers’ sixth round of skills maintenance seminars encourages builder interaction.
PlaceMakers presenter John Tait had everyone involved in the discussion at PlaceMakers’ skills maintenance seminar in Petone, where he quizzed them on the building code, the importance of ROW detail and much more.
“Don’t lift a hammer until you’ve read all the documentation!” and “If it’s not written down, it didn’t happen!” were two key points John reiterated through a number of personal examples from his building inspector experience.
John says it’s particularly important to have a good look at the plans before getting stuck into the work.
“Sometimes there might be parts of the design that lack detail, or just plain won’t work,” says John. “It’s much more useful to realise that up front than have to delay your build when it gets to that part – by then it might not be such an easy fix.”
Given the number of legislation changes in the industry, and the disconnect that sometimes occurs between designers, homeowners, councils and builders, John said the best advice builders can take on board is to document everything, ask questions and trust your instincts.
“If your gut tells you something doesn’t seem right, don’t just ignore it and carry on with the work – ask someone who can alleviate your concerns,” says John.
A number of builders recounted situations of that nature that they’d encountered, and John shed light on why it might have occurred and the best course of action to take.
Licensed Building Practitioners (LBPs) Kent Slobbé and Andrew Rouse-Wyeth, who work for Ezra Enterprises in Wellington, said the seminar provided great insight into their responsibilities.
“While we’re not business owners, we’re LBPs and it’s important that we know what we’re responsible for and what we’re not,” said Kent. “A lot of these projects run on pretty tight timelines, but this serves as a good reminder that saving a few minutes isn’t worth compromising our licence or our reputation.”

As promised, Under Construction will be including all compulsory Codewords articles to help LBPs earn their required points and stay up to speed with changes. This month’s article is required for those who hold a Carpentry or Foundations licence
U nder the new skills maintenance scheme, reading Codewords articles relevant to your licence and answering the corresponding questions is a mandatory part of skills maintenance (for those who have renewed their licence since 2 November 2015). Once you’ve read the article, go to the LBP website (under Codewords Issue 74) to answer the associated questions.
Doing it right with jack and pack
In mid-2015, MBIE carried out a survey of earthquake-damaged and repaired homes in Canterbury (CEDAR survey). While the topic of the report was earthquake repairs, the information that came out of the survey is useful for anyone undertaking foundation repair. This article looks at what we learned about the jack and pack repair method.
Assessing the situation
The first step is to assess whether to repair the damaged section of foundations or replace it. This will depend on the extent of the damage. For example if you are:
Relevelling a timber framed floor by more than 100mm then the subfloor may need to be rebuilt rather than repaired.
Assessing a pile that is more than 15mm out of plumb, you should look at replacing it.
Going to relevel a concrete slab foundation and it is more than 150mm out of level, a rebuild is the suggested option.
You should also identify if the work needs a building consent. A significant repair to the structure (including the foundation) of a home will likely need a building consent. A minor repair to a few piles may not need one, but it pays to check with the local Building Consent Authority, or read MBIE’s guidance on Schedule 1 of the Building Act.
Doing the job The general steps to relevelling include:
Making the area safe and ready for the work.
Identifying the relevelling heights.
Detaching the connections and services from the subfloor.
Applying the relevelling methodology.
Reattaching connections and services.
Reinstating disturbed ground and tidying up.
For a jack and pack repair on a timber subfloor, if you are lifting the bearers to pack them up, a single H3.2 treated timber packer or folding wedges fixed in place are suggested.
Remember, if you need to pack a pile more than 100mm, you should replace the pile instead.
You should also replace the piles that are out of alignment or are leaning too far over.
Once you have packed the piles, you need to ensure the pile, packer and bearer are aligned and fixed together well.
Unsure of what to do?
If you are unsure of the methodology or whether the work should have a building consent, it is a good idea to speak to the local building consent authority.
For expert advice you could consult with an engineer, or direct the home owner to get some advice.

The new medium density residential standards may require designers to add a further LBP area of practice. Even if you don‘t strictly need the licence, you must be able to show you have the skills and competency to design buildings over 10m in height
Recently a colleague posed this question: ‘Currently, I have a Design Area of Practice (AoP) 2 licence. Do I need to apply for a Design AoP 3 licence to be able to carry out design work under the new medium density residential standards ? ’
The answer is that you may need an AoP 2 licence if the design work comes within the definition of Restricted Building Work (RBW), but not a Design AoP 3.
The reason the answer is ‘may’ and not ‘must’ relates to differences in the height limits in the definition of RBW in the Building (Definition of Restricted Building Work) Order 2011 compared to those in the medium density residential standards (MDRS).
Clause 6 of the Building (Definition of Restricted Building Work) Order 2011 stipulates:
Certain design work relating to primary structure or external moisture-management systems of residential buildings to be restricted building work
The kinds of design work described in subclause (2) are restricted building work for the purposes of the Act.
The design work referred to in subclause (1) is the preparation of any drawing, specification, or other document, according to which—
the primary structure of a house or a small-to-medium apartment building is proposed to be constructed or altered; or any external moisture-management system attached to or forming part of a house or a small-to-medium apartment building is proposed to be constructed or altered.
the primary structure of a house or a small-to-medium apartment building is proposed to be constructed or altered; or
any external moisture-management system attached to or forming part of a house or a small-to-medium apartment building is proposed to be constructed or altered.
The terms ‘house’ and ‘small-to-medium apartment building’ are defined in clause 3 of the Order as:
A house means ‘a free-standing, fully detached building consisting of a single residential unit – or a single residential unit and one or more residential facilities’.
A small-to-medium apartment building means ‘a building that:
Contains two or more residential units or residential facilities.
Does not contain parts that are neither residential units nor residential facilities.
Has a maximum calculated height of less than 10m.’
It is in the last part of the definition of small-to-medium apartment building that the differences with MDRS arise.
Clause 3 of the Order provides the following further definition: ‘maximum calculated height, in relation to a building, means the vertical distance between the highest point of its roof (excluding structures such as aerials, chimneys, flagpoles, and vents) and the lowest point of the ground’.
The MDRS, however, allow for a maximum building height of 11m plus 1m for a pitched roof. This exceeds the maximum calculated height provided in the Order.
Given this, a designer will have to be licensed and hold a Design AoP 2 Licence (based on the categories of buildings as defined in the Building (Designation of Building Work Licensing Classes) Order 2010) if the design work comes within the RBW definition.
However, if the building is a small-to-medium apartment building which exceeds 10m from its highest to lowest points, then it would fall outside of the RBW definition. The design work would not have to be carried out by an LBP.
Caution is, however, still advised even if the design work is not restricted building work.
Firstly, when it comes to disciplinary liability, LBP designers can be responsible and accountable for their work, even if it is not restricted building work. This is because the broadest disciplinary charge under the Building Act is negligence and/or incompetence. The specific charge (section 317(1)(b) of the Building Act) relates to building work, not restricted building work. Building work is defined in section 7 of the Act, and it is much wider than restricted building work, and it would include design work relating to an MDRS structure that was higher than 10m.
Secondly, the disciplinary regime focuses on competence. One way of assessing a LBP designer’s competence is by reference to the Area of Practice that they hold as defined in the Designation of Building Work Licensing Classes) Order 2010. Generally, Design AoP 1 licence holders are restricted to Category 1 Buildings, AoP 2 to Category 1 and 2 Buildings, and AoP 3 to Category 1, 2 and 3 Buildings. Interestingly, if you look at the Building (Designation of Building Work Licensing Classes) Order 2010 and compare the height limits in it to the RBW Order you will note that Category 3 Buildings fall outside of the definition of RBW. There may, in this difference, have been an element of future proofing should the definitions of RBW be extended at any time in the future.
Given the above, if a designer was developing a building consent for an MDRS building that had a high risk-matrix score or was nearing the upper limits in the MDRS allowable height, and they only held a Design AoP 1 licence, for example, then it may follow that they have carried out building work that is outside of their competence. This is another disciplinary charge under the Act (section 314 and 317(1)(h) of the Building Act) and another reason for caution.
It’s also worth noting that a designer who works outside of their personal competency may run into issues with their professional indemnity cover and their civil liability to their clients.
Finally, remember, the LBP scheme and Areas of Practice are designed to recognise the competence of designers so that consumers can choose the right person for the job. The scheme relies on designers using their licence responsibly to ensure quality compliant homes are built.

Updated and detailed Schedule 1 guidance for exempt building work has been released, following the November 2013 Building Act amendment – here’s the lowdown.
Did you know some plumbing and drainlaying work must be carried out by an ‘authorised person’, such as a registered certified plumber or drainlayer, before it can be considered exempt building work? Or that, if you are removing a building element such as a chimney, roof or cladding from a building three storeys or less, there is a new exemption which may mean you do not require a building consent?
These changes were made when Schedule 1 of the Building Act 2004 (the Act) was amended in November 2013.
In March this year, The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) published new guidance to help keep you up to date with the changes.
The guidance concentrates on the 43 exemptions of Schedule 1 and is full of information and practical examples, with photos. It clarifies the type of work that is exempt and who can carry out this work.
It’s important that builders are aware of building work that is exempt from a building consent, as your clients will often rely on you to advise them.
Carrying out building work that is not exempt, without a building consent, is an offence and can incur a fine of up to $200,000 and a further fine of up to $10,000 per day if work continues.
Councils continue to have discretionary powers to grant exemptions for any proposed building work under exemption 2. However, they must be satisfied that the completed work is likely to comply with the Building Code, or there is minimal risk of it endangering people or property. If you want any work to be considered under this exemption, it is important to start discussions early with the local council.
A new section, relating to Schedule 1, has been added to the Act, while Schedule 1 itself has been amended to make the exemptions easier to use.
This is a new section, which imposes some general conditions and limits on Schedule 1 exemptions and clarifies:
What type of building work is exempt from requiring a building consent.
Who can carry it out.
What other conditions apply.
The scope of building work covered by Schedule 1 does not vary much from the previous version, which was introduced in December 2010. However, it has a new numbering system and has been divided into three parts, depending on who can carry out the work:
Part 1: Exempted building work lists work that anyone can carry out. It includes exemption 2, formerly Schedule 1(k), which gives territorial and regional authorities the discretion to exempt any building work from requiring a building consent.
Part 2: Sanitary plumbing and drainlaying carried out by person authorised under Plumbers, Gasfitters, and Drainlayers Act 2006 .
Part 3: Building work for which design is carried out or reviewed by a chartered professional engineer.
To find out more, read the guidance Building work that does not require a building consent – Building Act 2004 at www.dbh.govt.nz/bc-no-consent .
Once the regulations have been written, the new consumer protection measures will come into effect and  builders will be required to provide clients with information about their credentials and enter into written contracts for work over a specified amount. These changes will make it easier for builders and homeowners to understand their rights and responsibilities. For a summary of the changes, go to www.dbh.govt.nz/bcupdate-149.
Building work in connection with a retaining wall that:
(a) retains not more than 1.5 metres depth of ground; and
(b) does not support any surcharge or any load additional to the load of that ground (for example, the load of vehicles).
This exemption allows you to build a retaining wall (which is any wall constructed to retain or support the surrounding ground) without needing to get a building consent as long as it does not retain more than 1.5 metres (vertically) of ground and it includes ground water drainage in relation to retaining walls.
This exemption does not apply to retaining walls that are subject to any additional load or surcharge, such as:
• vehicle driveways
• parking spaces
• buildings, or
• sloping ground above the top of the retaining wall.
Also refer to exemption 41 (retaining walls): this exemption covers building work relating to some retaining walls in rural zones as long as the design is carried out or reviewed by a chartered professional engineer.
If the ground above the top of the retaining wall is only gently sloping, this may not be considered as ‘surcharge’. To determine the impact of the sloping ground and its pressure on the stability of the proposed retaining wall, you may wish to seek professional advice; for example, from a chartered professional engineer.
If there is a fall of 1 metre or more from the retaining wall, you may be required to install a safety barrier (under Building Code clause F4 – Safety from falling).
Factors to consider include the purpose/use of the retaining wall, how accessible it is, and whether it is frequented by young children.
A builder plans to reconstruct an earthquake-damaged timber retaining wall that is less than 1.5 metres high. There is no surcharge on the retaining wall.
A motel owner decides to terrace the motel’s uphill sloping section by building three 1.2 metre high concrete crib retaining walls to create three level platforms, each of which will be planted. As there will be sufficient horizontal separation between each of the retaining walls so that no surcharge load will be imposed on a lower wall, no building consent will be needed.
An owner wishes to form a level platform for a garden below a neighbour’s driveway. To do this, she intends to construct a 1.2 metre high retaining wall. As the proposed retaining wall is subject to a surcharge from the neighbour’s vehicle driveway, it will require a building consent.
A retaining wall ranges in height from 900 mm to 1.8 metres. The part of the retaining wall that exceeds the maximum allowable height of 1.5 metres will require a building consent.

A warm winter home is no good if it is stiflingly hot in summer – good design and simple changes can make homes much more comfortable in the summer heat.
At the same time as homes are designed and built to be warm and healthy over winter, they also need to be kept cool during the summer. Overheating, especially in today’s well-insulated, airtight homes, is becoming an increasing problem.
Homes are often shut up during the day, allowing them to heat up. Once the house has become too hot, it’s much harder to cool down without using electricity. The key is designing the home to prevent overheating in the first place, by keeping the sun out during the hot parts of a summer’s day and creating air movement through the house.
If you’re the owner’s first point of contact, ensure they’re aware of the importance of this; if the design doesn’t include these features, ask the designer why they’re missing.
Keeping the sun out during summer is all about angles and orientation. You want the lower winter sun to come inside north-facing rooms but to keep the higher summer sun out at its peak. Later in the day, the summer sun will be lower and will shine in western windows – west-facing rooms often overheat in summer.
Design solutions which keep the summer sun out include:
Deep eaves on the northern side – carefully calculated to avoid summer overheating, but allowing winter sun to penetrate and warm the house.
Minimise western windows, because the low angle of the summer afternoon sun means eaves won’t stop the home from overheating.
Shade western windows – this is ideal if west-facing windows are required (eg to access views or outdoor living spaces). Consider deep verandas, awnings, movable shades or tinted glass.
Simple changes to make:
Plant deciduous trees near the house to shade northern or western windows. Deciduous trees will shade the windows in summer, but with no leaves in winter, will then let the sun in.
If it’s not possible to shade from the outside, the next best option is for the homeowner to install thick, lined curtains or blinds – as well as keeping the home warm in winter, they help to stop the sun getting in and overheating the house.
Air movement increases cooling by raising evaporation rates. It can be created through cross and stack ventilation. Cross ventilation happens when cool air from outside enters a building and forces warm air out through an opening such as a window or door. Stack ventilation happens when inside air warms, rises and escapes through any gaps at the top of the house, drawing in cool air from gaps at the bottom of the house. This pull is called the stack effect because it is the same process that draws smoke up a chimney. Using the stack effect to ventilate homes is the most effective way of keeping a house cool in summer.
Design solutions to create air movement include:
Larger windows opening to the breeze and smaller, higher windows (eg clerestory windows) on the opposite side of the house, which can be left open during summer to take advantage of the stack effect.
Ensuring windows can be opened on all sides of the house and that there are no barriers to airflow within the house. This could mean including an air grill above internal doors, so that cross ventilation can still occur even if doors are shut. Bedrooms with only one window are frequent victims of overheating – once the bedroom door is shut, there is no pressure gradient to pull cool air through the room.
Use of side-opening windows rather than awning-opening windows. Side-opening windows are much better at pulling breezes into the house. In-window passive vent systems, such as louvres and trickle vents. These are secure and can be left open when the house is unoccupied. BRANZ recommends 600 mm width of trickle vent for each average-sized room.
Solar or wind-powered ventilation systems – these are roof-located ventilation systems, which can either run all the time, or be manually controlled. They are best located at a high point in a home, combined with lower opening windows.
“More and more building companies are providing design-build options and, even if you aren’t it’s useful to know why you’re building the way you are
Simple changes to make:
One of the most effective ways to cool a home in summer is to leave windows open overnight. If there are concerns about security, easy-to-install security stays are available from your local PlaceMakers store.
One of the most energy-efficient options for air movement is to use fans – either ceiling-mounted or portable fans that can be moved around the house as needed. Running a fan makes the air feel three degrees cooler.
Design is the key to summer cooling, as it is much easier to prevent overheating at an early stage than to rectify it later. More and more building companies are providing design-build options and, even if you aren’t, it’s useful to know why you’re building the way you are. Remember, with good design, homes can be winter warm and summer cool!

An essential element for maintaining the credibility of the Licensed Building Practitioners (LBP) scheme is ongoing skills maintenance. Its overarching goal is to ensure that the sector undertakes professional development in line with changing regulations, technology and construction practices, health and safety and running a business.
LBPs are required to keep a record of learning to be submitted by their licence renewal date. As part of the renewal process, applicants, selected at random, will have their record of learning audited – LBP scheme registrar Mark Scully says this process is catching some by surprise.
It’s fair to say that while many participants have kept reasonable records there are also some who have only basic notes and others who have little or no record at all.
“We are currently in a pilot phase for the audit process. The minimum expectation of an LBP around skills maintenance is to gather a record of learning with evidence of the activities undertaken.
“It’s fair to say that while many participants have kept reasonable records, there are also some who have only basic notes and others who have little or no record at all.
“Lack of record keeping has caused difficulty for some of those audited. It is not uncommon for auditors to receive a running tally from the back of a builder’s diary as a record of learning.
“To make an accurate assessment, auditors need as much evidence of skills maintenance as an LBP can provide; if they can detail what they learned, that’s even better – a list written down once or twice a year doesn’t show much about what the LBP has done or what they have learned,” says Mr Scully
“As the audit pilot has progressed, it has become evident that there is a need to better assess actual learning and how it was applied to the job, rather than just evidence of participation. It is likely that over the next few years, we will develop processes to improve our assessment of what an LBP learned. We need to ensure the validity of the scheme to give consumers confidence in our industry,” he says.
As the development of the skills maintenance assessment continues, PlaceMakers will continue to support its builders with informative seminars and the ongoing publication of Under Construction. Keep an eye out for our next round of skills maintenance seminars – the industry keeps changing and we aim to keep you across it!

If you’re looking for an apprentice, or have one already, Got a Trade week is an opportunity for you to find one or help entice others into the industry by showing them around your worksite
The biggest showcase of New Zealand tradespeople in the country’s history is coming soon. Got a Trade week, running 21-28 August, is part of a nationwide campaign to raise awareness of workplace qualifications among jobseekers, their teachers and parents. If you have an apprentice, bring them along so they can share their experience with aspiring ones.
New Zealand needs skilled tradespeople. The 2014 Talent Shortage Survey , produced by Manpower Group, shows that engineers, technicians and skilled trades feature among ‘the top five jobs employers have difficulty filling’ across the Asia-Pacific region. Globally, skilled trades are the highest in demand.
As part of a recent BRANZ  survey about what a career map for the industry should look like, secondary and post-secondary students and trainees were surveyed to understand their information requirements and their biggest influences in making career decisions. The key findings showed that most students want real information and practical examples from talking to people already working in the industry they’re considering. That’s where the concept for Got a Trade week was born.
It aims to enhance public perception of training and career prospects in New Zealand’s service and trade industries, by getting up close and personal with modern-day apprentices, trainees and the companies that employ them. Their stories will inspire and seed conversations in homes, schools and workplaces, while showing the sense of pride that comes from acquiring new skills and qualifications on the job.
Launched at the 2014 Careers Expo , the GOT A TRADE? GOT IT MADE campaign is the collaborative brainchild of seven industry training organisations:
BCITO
Competenz
Connexis
HITO
MITO
Service IQ
The Skills Organisation
BCITO will give students the chance to see the building and construction industry in action and the opportunity to meet real people involved in it.
The BCITO Got a Trade Day is happening on Thursday 27 August, when BCITO’s 14 regional teams will be joining with local industry, employers and apprentices to host career seekers at a number of construction-related facilities and locations.
In all regions, BCITO is looking for employers and apprentices who would welcome the opportunity to invite a group of students/career seekers onto their worksite, so you can share why you’ve got it made.
If you’re interested in being involved in the BCITO Got a Trade Day, please contact Daniel Jone at BCITO on 0800 4BCITO (422 486). Visit gotatradegotitmade.co.nz to find out more.

Keep up to speed with implied warranties and what changes are on the way
As building industry regulations continue to change, PlaceMakers is doing its best to keep its builders in the know through reading Under Construction and offering skills maintenance seminars across the country.
During PlaceMakers’ three-month seminar tour, presented by John Tait, there were several questions raised around implied warranties – and what they actually implied. To ensure everyone is in the know, we’ve re-capped the information below.
On 30 November 2004, mandatory warranties to protect homeowners took effect; these apply to builders, specialist tradespeople and developers. These warranties apply whether you write them in the contract or not, and you can’t change your contract so they don’t apply. If you are the main contractor on the job, and have employed the subcontractors, warranties for their workmanship are covered in your contract.
The building work will be done properly, competently and in accordance with the plans and specifications.
All the materials used will be suitable and, unless otherwise stated in the contract, new.
The building work will comply with all laws including the Building Act and the Building Code.
The building work will be carried out with reasonable care and skill and completed within the time specified, or a reasonable time if no time is stated.
The household unit will be suitable for occupation at the end of the work.
If the contract states any particular outcome and the owner relies on the skill and judgement of the contractor to achieve it, the building work and the materials will be fit for purpose and be of a nature and quality suitable to achieve that result.
The Building Amendment Bill (No.4) was passed into law on 20 November and is now the Building Amendment Act 2013. While the changes to implied warranties regime referred to in this Act have not yet come into effect, it’s worth being aware of the changes it will incur – it expands the implied warranties regime for residential building contracts so that they are also implied into every sale and purchase contract entered into by an on-seller.
As before, these warranties are mandatory – it is not possible to contract out of them. They apply to all residential contracts entered into after the Act comes into force by Order in Council (probably later in 2014).
At the moment, the Building Act doesn’t specify a defect notification period, though it is found in every standard form contract and the period typically ranges from 30 days to three months from when the work was completed.
A key change to the current implied warranties regime will be that, if there is notification of a defect in the building work within one year of the work being completed, the building contractor is required to fix the defect within a reasonable time.
During this period, the onus of proof is on the building contractor – that is, the client merely needs to claim a defect exists and does not need to prove a breach. It will be for the building contractor to prove their innocence if they dispute this.
To avoid problems with implied warranties, you should:
Include in your contract a clear mechanism for determining when the building work is completed, in order to determine when the one-year defect notification period starts.
Provide clients with documentation, setting out detailed maintenance requirements for the building work. This will assist in excluding your liability, where the defect relates to lack of maintenance.*
Ensure your arrangements with subcontractors enable you to claim against them, if their actions cause a breach of these implied warranties.
Check your insurance policies to ensure that you are covered for these implied warranties.
Ensure your business is properly structured, to take account of this potential liability.
Don’t attempt to contract out of these implied warranties or advise a client that they don’t apply – that will be a breach of the Fair Trading Act.

To support its customers in navigating the industry’s changes, PlaceMakers continues to offer opportunities for upskilling.
H ere’s an overview of what you can expect by attending your local session.
Health and safety focus – how are others handling it?
Presenter John Tait will relay information from WorkSafe’s most recent guidance on ‘working at height’, ‘working on roofs’ and ‘safe use of safety nets’. He will highlight the areas where good planning and monitoring can make all the difference.
The seminars will shed light on some of the common myths that have surfaced since the new health and safety reform became law – from ladders being outlawed to scaffolding being mandatory.
John also shares some insights arising from a case study conducted by WorkSafe, with some key messages around worker participation.
LBP update
There will be useful information from the LBP registrar’s on the most common themes relating to LBP complaints, as well as other observations.
One of the most common LBP complaints is centered round “poor understanding and application of site supervision”, which recently prompted the Building Practitioners Board to clarify the definition of supervision for LBPs. The Registrar draws attention to factors the Board took into account in a recent decision about negligent or incompetent supervision.
Regulatory updates
The seminars will include reminders about recent regulatory changes, such as the Construction Contracts Act, Residential Tenancy Act changes, the recent ban on retrofitting foil insulation and more.
John will also provide advice on how to avoid inspection failures. Having spoken to team leaders at several councils around the country, he will cover a few non-compliance issues which often lead to a failed inspection.
Additionally, attendees can learn more about a recent MBIE determination that could have far-reaching implications.
“Builders will be surprised when they hear about this one,” says John. “It highlights the importance of establishing for sure and in advance whether a change is considered minor, or requires an amendment to the consent.”

Recent board decision prompts review of RoW guidelines The requirement to provide a record of work (RoW) has been in place since March 2012; however, there have been a number of complaints against LBPs around when the form is required to be completed, who it should be provided to and what LBPs’ key obligations are in respect to this record.
A recent Building Practitioners Board decision ( C2-01170 ), which involved a situation in which one party asked another party to sign off work the other said wasn’t accurate, prompted the Board to revisit and review the RoW guidelines as part of its considerations. The questions below cover the main points from that decision.
Who must provide an RoW? Each and every LBP must provide an RoW on the completion of Restricted Building Work (RBW) they have undertaken. Even if someone else is in charge, if you’re an LBP you must provide an RoW for your work if it is RBW.
What is an RoW for? An RoW ensures people involved with work can be identified by the owner and the council, but it does not create any liability other than what already existed without an RoW.
On completion of RBW Even if the overall job is not complete, if you’ve finished your work onsite or will not be going back, you still need to provide an RoW. The Board suggests that “sooner rather than later” is a good approach; even if you’re in a dispute with another party, you still have to provide an RoW.
How soon after completion of RBW? The Board decided that you need to provide the RoW “a short time” after you complete your work.
There’s no exact rule, but “sooner rather than later” is a great approach. You don’t need to wait until someone asks you to provide one, and you can complete these forms online at the LBP portal www.lbp.govt.nz.
How much detail is required? Enough detail is needed that if someone else picked it up, they would understand what work you did. It is also good to be able to show what work you did not do, in case a dispute were to arise.
Who must an RoW be provided to? The law says you must provide it to the property owner and local council. If the owner has appointed an agent (such as a designer or architect), you could give it to them unless the owner asks for it directly. However, it is an LBP’s responsibility to ensure both parties receive a copy on completion of RBW.
Good reasons for not providing an RoW There has only been one case where the Board agreed there was a good reason for not providing an RoW, and that was where the LBP’s boss was trying to get him to provide RoW for work he did not do or supervise. To read details about that decision, see decision number C1129 . So, in conclusion it is pretty rare that someone has a “good excuse” and the Board has said many times that payment disputes are not good reasons.

As promised, Under Construction will be including all compulsory Codewords articles to help LBPs earn their required points. This month’s article is only required if you hold a Design licence, but it’s worth knowing anyway!
U nder the new skills maintenance scheme, reading Codewords articles relevant to your licence and answering the corresponding questions is a mandatory part of skills maintenance (for those who have renewed their licence since 2 November 2015).
Once you’ve read the article, go to the LBP website (under Codewords Issue 73) to answer the associated questions.
Glass barrier back-up
Designers should note a recent amendment to glass barrier requirements, intended to create a ‘second line of defence’.
The amendment means that Acceptable Solution B1/AS1 now cites the glass barrier requirements in section 22 of NZS 4223.3:2016 Glazing in buildings – Part 3: ‘Human impact safety requirements’.
The 1999 version of Part 3 gave thicknesses for glass in barriers but no details of the construction of the whole barrier.
The changes came into effect on 1 June 2016 by way of Amendment 13 to B1/AS1 .
The figure below shows an example barrier from NZS4223.3:2016 .
NZS 4223.3:2016 has diagrams for nine different barrier configurations that incorporate glass. It also provides the necessary glass thicknesses for different types of safety glass.
Where these barriers have an unsupported glass top edge, there must be an interlinking rail of some type. It must be strong enough to provide reasonable support for a person impacting the barrier should a glass pane fail. The interlinking rail needs to be either:
At the top edge (1m or 1100mm height); or
Alongside it.
The objective is to provide a ‘second line of defence’ because, while glass barriers can be very strong, glass is a brittle material and does not break or fail in a ductile way.
The interlinking rail needs significant bending strength as it must be able to span the gap that would result from any individual pane failing or being broken. The frame itself, as well as any necessary interlinking rail, will still require specific structural design.
What standard you need to adhere to will depend on when your building consent was accepted. Building consent applications for glass barriers:
Accepted before 1 June 2016 may use the old version of B1/AS1 (Amendment 12).
Made on or after 1 June 2016 must comply with the new barrier requirements in Amendment 13 if B1/AS1 is used, or achieve an equivalent level of performance using an alternative solution.
Should include appropriate documentation, showing compliance with the barrier requirements in B1/AS1 Amendment 13, and sourced from barrier suppliers or suitably qualified engineers.
Existing glass barriers do not need to be upgraded to comply with the new requirements, although it may be possible to retrofit structural glass barriers to comply with NZS 4223.3:2016.
Only section 22 of NZS 4223.3:2016 came into force in B1/AS1 on 1 June 2016.
Other sections of NZS 4223.3:2016 are not part of B1/AS1 Amendment 13, but may be used as part of an alternative solution.

Good ventilation is key to ensuring the home you build for your clients is one they can be happy and healthy in.
O n average, New Zealanders spend 75% or more of their time at home – yet surveys of New Zealand homes show they are cold and damp, the perfect conditions for mould, which thrives in humidity greater than 70%.
A dry home is all about ventilation, stopping moisture getting in and removing the sources of moisture.
Much of a home’s ventilation depends on its design – how it is oriented and the number and placement of windows.
If you’re the owner’s first point of contact,ensure they’re aware of the importance of ventilation; if the design doesn’t call for it, ask the designer why it’s missing.
Considerable moisture is generated by simple household activities. A shower, for example, can produce 1.5 litres each time it’s used. This moisture evaporates into the air and, if not removed, can contribute to condensation and mould.
The most significant sources of moisture in a home come from the kitchen, bathroom and laundry. All these rooms should have mechanical extract ventilation (extractor fans or range hoods) to remove moisture.
Ensure you vent to the outside and not into the roof space, as that will allow moisture to accumulate and damage the insulation and internal roof structures.
Range hoods should extract to the outside, rather than recycling air, as recycling simply removes food smells but not the moisture from cooking.
Extract ventilation is so straightforward that it’s often not top of mind when thinking of home performance.
A dry home is all about ventilation, stopping moisture getting in and removing the sources of moisture
However, providing your clients with effective means to extract moist air from their home is a simple way you can contribute to their health and enjoyment in years to come.
Choose the right-sized fan for the job. A fan that’s too small won’t remove enough moist air to keep the home dry. A fan that’s too large can create draughts. Minimum requirements for extractor fan performance are set down under the Building Code.
Install models with automatic controls, such as a timer, which runs for ten minutes after it is turned off.
Combined light/extract units are often not very effective ventilators, as the light unit usually reduces the extract rate – select separate units.
Locate the extract inlet as close as possible to the moisture source – for example, close to the shower if it’s in a bathroom.
Locate the outlet vent away from windows – otherwise the moist air will just blow back in if the window is open.
Pay attention to the ducting – straight ducting is much more effective than ducting which has kinks or goes around a corner
Ensure the weather grill shuts properly, so that there isn’t too much heat loss when the fan’s not in use.
With range hoods, it’s important that the hood covers the whole stove – and isn’t too far away from the elements. If it’s a smaller size than the stove, or very high above the elements, then it won’t work.

If you are doing plumbing and drainage work as part of a kitchen or bathroom home renovation, you may not need a building consent for certain projects if an authorised person completes the work. This article by Auckland Council covers when you may or may not require a consent
A n authorised person must be employed to carry out the plumbing and drainage building work for it to have building consent exemption. If an authorised person does not complete the work, then it is not exempt.
The term ‘authorised person’ covers:
Registered certified plumbers and drainlayers.
Plumbers and drainlayers with a provisional licence working under supervision.
Trainee plumbers and drainlayers working under supervision.
You must make sure the plumber or drainlayer you are using for your building work has current authorisation from the Plumbers, Gasfitters, and Drainlayers Board.
Work by an owner-builder
If you are an owner-builder, you can carry out the low-risk work on a kitchen or bathroom renovation if you:
Meet the requirements of the Building Code.
Obtain any necessary building consent or permits before starting work.
Owner-builder exemptions do not cover electrical, gas, plumbing or drainage work unless the owner-builder holds the appropriate licence.
Plumbing and drainage work exemptions
You are unlikely to need a building consent for plumbing and drainage work involving the repair or replacement of an existing sanitary fixture such as a sink or toilet pan. You are required to obtain a building consent if the work involves adding an additional sanitary fixture to your house – eg, a new bath – where there was not one previously.
A building consent is not required to repair or maintain an existing water heater, if it is carried out by an authorised person. More information on work that is exempted under the Schedule 1 of the Building Act 2004 is available on the MBIE Building Performance website.
Check if you need a consent
You don’t need a building consent for work listed as exempted under Schedule 1 of the Building Act 2004.
You are unlikely to require a building consent to:
Re-position or replace sanitary fixtures (eg, a bath, bidet, wash hand basin, shower or toilet pan) within an existing home bathroom.
Move a toilet pan from a toilet compartment into an adjacent existing bathroom.
Remodel an existing kitchen within the same space, leaving the kitchen sink in the same position.
Move an existing home laundry tub to a new location to an adjacent room.
Relocate or remove an existing hose tap.
Remove a bath with a shower over it and replace it with a new proprietary shower enclosure and a new bath within the existing bathroom space.
You will need a building consent to:
Install a tiled wet area shower – as it involves critical building work that is not sanitary plumbing, such as carpentry and installing waterproof membranes.
Move a vanity, bath, and shower within an apartment of a multi-level building, as it may involve new penetrations through a fire separation.
Add a shower, hand basin, and toilet to an ensuite, as these sanitary fixtures are additional to those already existing in the building.
Where sanitary plumbing work could adversely affect the performance of structural elements, such as floor joists or wall framing, this work may require a building consent.
All work must comply with the Building Code.
If you are not sure, get professional advice.

On 26 October 2021 a Code of Ethics was introduced by Government for Licensed Building Practitioners (LBPs), with a one-year transition period before it becomes enforceable
According to MBIE, the Code of Ethics will ensure high standards are maintained in the industry, while giving the public more confidence that Licensed Building Practitioners (LBPs) are reputable and operate ethically. The majority of LBPs already meet these standards, but the Code of Ethics will hold those who do not to account.
From 26 October 2022, the Code of Ethics becomes enforceable by the Building Practitioners Board.
This provides LBPs a year to understand their obligations. MBIE has developed guidance which includes explanations and practical examples of how the Code of Ethics can be applied. Additional resources will become available over the next year.
What are the principles of the Code of Ethics? From 26 October 2022, LBPs will have the following obligations:
1. Work safely
Take responsibility for health and safety.
Report unsafe behaviour by others on a building site.
Avoid harming the environment.
2. Act within the law
Comply with the law.
Report breaches of the law.
3. Take responsibility for your actions
Know what building work you are allowed to do.
Explain risks to your client.
Inform and educate your client.
Be accountable for building work carried out by you, or someone under your supervision.
Advise clients of any delays as soon as they become apparent.
Act in your client’s interests.
Follow your client’s instructions.
4. Behave professionally
Behave professionally.
Act in good faith during dispute resolution.
Price work fairly and reasonably.
Declare and manage actual or potential conflicts of interest appropriately.
Maintain confidentiality of client details unless there is good reason for sharing information.
Acknowledge and respect the cultural norms and values of your clients and colleagues.
Conduct your business in a methodical and responsible manner.
Code of Ethics guidance The guidance document helps to navigate the Code of Ethics by providing explanations and practical examples of how an LBP’s behaviour can align with their obligations. This can be found under ‘assets’ on lbp.govt.nz .
More resources to come MBIE will develop additional educational resources to help ensure everyone understands what they will need to do. These are expected to be available from December 2021 onwards.
Breaching the Code of Ethics If LBPs do not comply with their obligations, a complaint can be made against them which may result in disciplinary action by the Building Practitioners Board. Details on these grounds and a complaint form can be found under ‘complaints and past decisions’ on lbp.govt.nz .
The Code of Ethics is not enforceable by the Building Practitioners Board until 26 October 2022. This means that complaints about someone breaching the Code of Ethics can only be made if the breach takes place from 26 October 2022.

MBIE discusses liability versus accountability when it comes to labour-only contracts
In the first of a two-part series highlighting common misunderstandings about the responsibilities of a Licensed Building Practitioner (LBP) under a labour-only contract, we discuss liability as opposed to accountability and building consents.
There has been an increase in complaints made to the Building Practitioners Board about LBPs not fulfilling their obligations under  labour-only contracts.
LBPs have responsibilities and obligations
There is a myth that LBPs’ responsibilities are lessened in labour-only contracts.
This is not true. You cannot contract out of your responsibilities and obligations as an LBP – they are set regardless of the type of contract you are working under.
The Board has acknowledged that a power imbalance may exist between an employer and employee; however, as an LBP, you are still responsible for your own conduct.
This means that, even if your employer has instructed you to do something, you are personally accountable to the Board for your actions as an LBP. Your licence could be put at risk if you act dishonestly to benefit your employer.
Liability vs accountability
When a homeowner signs a contract with a contractor, there will be a contractual liability between the two parties. This means the contractor must provide the goods and services as agreed, and the client must pay for them. Failure by either party could lead to court action, where the party in breach may be found liable for their role in the contract.
You might not have a contractual arrangement with the client, but rather with another contractor while under a labour-only contract. In this situation, you are probably only liable to the contractor who engaged you for the work you do for them.
However, as an LBP, you are always accountable to the Board for your conduct. If you fail to maintain standards, the homeowner can lay a complaint to the Board.
The Board can then discipline you, regardless of who you are contracted to. This is because the Board does not deal with payment or contractual disputes and instead determines whether the LBP has met their obligations specified in the Act.
Comply with building consents
In many cases, as an LBP on a labour only contract, you will not be directly responsible for managing the building consent application. All LBPs, however, have a responsibility to ensure that a building consent is obtained (if one is required) before commencing work and to build to the agreed consent. The Board expects LBPs to understand the building consent process and to hold themselves to a high standard throughout the compliance process.
Complaints show main problems
The Board’s Annual Report 2018 noted numerous complaints relating to LBPs not complying with the consenting processes. The complaints highlighted the following failures:
Carrying out building work without first checking that a building consent has been issued.
Deviating from the building consent.
Failing to obtain confirmation for a minor variation or amendment before continuing work.
If something isn’t right with the building consent, alert the homeowner and refrain from starting or continuing work until the issue is resolved. While it may not be your responsibility to obtain the building consent, you will be responsible if you do any building work that does not comply with a building consent, if one is required.
You are the expert so use your judgment
Homeowners are not experts in the building process and may sometimes fail to fully understand their obligations regarding building consents. LBPs are in a better position to identify a lack of adherence to the consenting process.
Use your own judgement, rather than trusting that the homeowner has it right or that you won’t be held accountable for any non-compliant work.
In the next issue, we will look at your responsibility to produce quality work and an accurate Record of Work.

PlaceMakers seminars help builders get ready for consumer protection measures
Having a contract for every job may seem like a mission – but when it comes to a dispute, it can be your lifesaver.
PlaceMakers’ seventh round of seminars finished at the end of November and those who attended said they enjoyed the variety of content and learned a great deal.
While the main focus was on how to prepare for and deal with the impending consumer protection measures, the presentation also addressed homeowners’ expectations, consent fees, E3 – internal moisture , and featured a presentation from Sika product specialists about waterproofing applications and products (see the BRANZ article on Page 8 for more details on waterproofing).
Presenter John Tait fielded a number of questions about new regulations and reiterated that, while compulsory contracts for work worth $30,000 or more may seem unnecessary in some instances, it was a smart move overall.
“When a dispute arises in the absence of a contract, the homeowner almost always wins,” says John. “Having a solid contract is a huge advantage to builders and some of the other requirements, such as stipulating how variations will be handled, can work in our favour as well.”
However, John said increased accountability shouldn’t be limited to builders. He said formalities between builders and homeowners should be mirrored between builders and subcontractors, and that designers should be accountable for their specifications.
“While it might seem excessive to have contracts with your subbies, remember that if the project is delayed due to their actions, and you don’t have a contract, the onus falls on you. You need to protect yourself,” says John.
“When a dispute arises in the absence of a contract, the homeowner almost always wins” – John Tait
“It’s the same with some designers. If you receive the consent documentation and feel their specifications are too vague, go back to them or ask the council how it got past them. You have to price on these plans remember, so a lack of information on the plans could prove very frustrating when it comes time to order materials and build.”
John said builders across the board are going to need to consider increasing their rates, or charge separately for time spent on compliance paperwork and project management.
“It’s hard at the beginning, as builders might not all raise their rates simultaneously, but this is important. People will need to accommodate the increased workload at some point,” says John.
PlaceMakers will run its next round of seminars early next year. In the meantime, keep reading Under Construction to stay up to speed with regulatory updates and industry news.
There were plenty of questions being asked at the PlaceMakers’ session in Petone, which more than 150 builders attended

TITLE   : Altering an existing building

In November 2021, the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) released the biggest energy efficiency updates in more than a decade
The changes included an increase to the number of climate zones from three to six and increased insulation requirements for roofs, walls, floors, windows, doors and skylights.
They also provided a new compliance pathway for heating, ventilating and air conditioning (HVAC) systems in commercial buildings.
These changes will deliver warmer, drier and healthier buildings that cost significantly less to heat and will also generate carbon savings through improved energy efficiency.
The H1 Energy Efficiency acceptable solutions and verification methods provide ways to comply with the Building Code, and are straightforward to use when dealing with a brand new building. However, things get a little more complicated when you want to make an alteration or addition to an existing building.
The Building Act 2004 requires all new building work to comply with the Building Code, both when a building consent is required or if the work is exempt. However, if you are carrying out building work to alter an existing building, sections 42A and 112 of the Building Act make provisions for the building to comply with the energy efficiency requirements of the Building Code to at least the same extent as it did immediately before the building work began. In a nutshell, the performance of the building needs to be at least as good as it was before you altered it.
So, how can you confirm that an alteration to a building will comply with the energy efficiency requirements of the Building Code ?
When determining what thermal resistance is required for repaired or replaced building elements, you should consider the existing performance of the building, the extent of the element being replaced, and how the element contributes to the overall performance of the building. You can then use judgment to ensure that the replacement will perform to at least the same extent. The extent of the building envelope that is altered or replaced will influence how closely the repair/replacement should match the R-values specified for new buildings in the acceptable solutions.
Adding an extension or making a large alteration
For an addition or larger alteration to an existing building, all new construction must meet the requirements of clause H1, but the rest of the building that is not being altered does not have to be upgraded to comply with the current requirements. The altered building as a whole must comply with clause H1 to at least the same extent as it did before the alteration. In other words, all new work must comply fully with current Code requirements, and the energy efficiency of the building as a whole must not be made worse by the alteration.
A simple way to achieve this is to ensure that the new construction complies with the acceptable solution or verification method, and any parts of the existing building that are affected by the alteration do not achieve lower thermal performance than they did before the alteration.
If the energy efficiency performance of the building is reduced because of the addition or extension, some existing parts of the building may need to be upgraded. However, the upgrade is not required to meet the levels set in the relevant H1 acceptable solution but should ensure that the building as a whole continues to achieve the level of thermal performance it enjoyed before the addition or extension.
If the building was originally constructed to exceed the minimum performance levels specified in the Building Code, and the alteration will not lower the performance to below the Code requirements, then you would not need to upgrade the envelope, as it will still comply with the current requirements.
An example of this is an alteration where a new skylight is installed in an insulated roof. The R-value of the skylight is likely to be less than that of the existing roof structure that it replaces. To ensure that the overall performance of the building is not reduced, you will need to add sufficient insulation elsewhere in the thermal envelope to offset the loss in thermal resistance at the new skylight, such as installing additional roof insulation in other areas.
Smaller repairs or replacements
For repairs or replacement of a small part of the building envelope, you should simply ensure the overall thermal resistance of a building is not diminished.
An example of this is the replacement of an older, single glazed window or door. The replacement joinery will need to perform to at least the same extent as the one being removed but will not be required to comply fully with the current Code requirements.
For any work that alters an existing building, the main thing to remember is that the building’s overall compliance with the energy efficiency requirements of the Building Code must not be less than it was prior to the alteration taking place.
You can find more information about how to comply with the H1 Energy efficiency requirements when altering an existing building on our website.
Don’t miss opportunities to improve building performance
Renovations and alterations oftentimes provide once-in-a-generation opportunities to significantly improve the performance of existing buildings cost effectively. Examples are retrofitting insulation to building elements that are otherwise inaccessible, or choosing high-performance, double-glazing when single-glazed windows need replacing. In such situations, it makes sense to go beyond what the Building Act requires.
Key dates for H1 Energy efficiency updates
On 1 May 2023, there was an increase to the insulation performance requirements for walls, floors, roofs, windows and doors in new housing. This was the next step in the staged transition for insulation requirements in housing.
The staged requirements are set out in tables within the H1 acceptable solution and verification method documents, and are summarised in a news story previously published at: building.govt.nz/about-building-performance/all-news-and-updates/transition-dates-for-the-building-code-updates-programme .

To he lp builders get to grips with ongoing regulatory changes across the industry, PlaceMakers aims to provide ongoing support to its customers “It’s about doing our bit to help Licensed Building Practitioners (LBPs)  earn the necessary skills maintenance points,” says PlaceMakers general manager operations and marketing Gary Woodhouse.
“We ensure our customers can earn all their required elective points through PlaceMakers initiatives, such as reading our monthly Under Construction magazine and attending our seminars. Dispelling skills maintenance myths
PlaceMakers representatives have recently fielded some questions about the points gained by attending seminars and reading trade publications such as Under Construction, in light of recent changes to the LBP scheme.
In short, the answer is yes – both of these activities are still relevant and earn Licensed Building Practitioners skills maintenance points.
However, what has changed is the number of points LBPs can earn through these mediums, which are now considered elective activities. Whereas previously an LBP carpenter could earn all of his required 24 skills maintenance points over two years in this manner, now he can only earn 12. This is because the new scheme is not entirely points-based; it includes both compulsory and elective activities.
The compulsory activities – reading Codewords and recording on-the-job learning – equate to half of the required points. The remaining points still need to be earned through elective activities, such as reading Under Construction or attending skills maintenance seminars. Seminars under way
To help keep LBPs up to speed with the newest legislation changes, PlaceMakers tenth round of skills maintenance seminars is now under way. Presenter John Tait will  be looking at the new WorkSafe licensing requirements for working with asbestos, focusing on what builders can and can’t ‘touch’ without a licence.
The seminars will help builders get to grips with MBIE’s recent ‘Quick Guide to Product Substitution’.
John will also be discussing Building Code clause F2 – Hazardous Building Materials, with a particular focus on safety glass in bathrooms and deck barriers, as well as an update on LBP complaints and the lessons that can be drawn from them.

The Code of Ethics, which came into force on 25 October 2022, sets behavioural standards for Licensed Building Practitioners (LBPs). These give both the industry and the public clarity on what is expected from LBPs, and hold them to account
T he Code of Ethics ensures high standards are maintained in the industry, while giving the public more confidence that LBPs are undertaking building work in a safe, legal, and professional way.
It also provides people, such as homeowners, with an avenue to complain should an LBP breach the standards. Most LBPs already work to the highest professional and ethical standards.
The Code of Ethics will hold those who do not meet these standards to account, by providing clear grounds for the Building Practitioners Board to take disciplinary action against LBPs who behave unprofessionally.
What the Code of Ethics includes
The Code of Ethics is made up of 19 standards, which sit under the following four key principles:
1.Work safely
Take responsibility for health and safety.
Report unsafe behaviour by others on a building site.
Avoid harming the environment.
2.Act within the law
Comply with the law.
Report breaches of the law.
3.Take responsibility for your actions
Know what building work you are allowed to do.
Explain risks to your client.
Inform and educate your client.
Be accountable for building work carried out by you, or someone under your supervision.
Advise clients of any delays as soon as they become apparent.
Act in your client’s interests.
Generally, you should follow your client’s instructions unless the instructions are dangerous, are contrary to contracts or consents, or would mean you would not be acting within the law.
4.Behave professionally
Behave professionally.
Act in good faith during dispute resolution.
Price work fairly and reasonably.
Declare and manage actual or potential conflicts of interest appropriately.
Maintain confidentiality of client details, unless there is good reason for sharing information.
Acknowledge and respect the cultural norms and values of your clients and colleagues.
Conduct your business in a methodical and responsible manner.
Where to find more information
The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) has developed information and education resources to help LBPs and the public learn more about the Code of Ethics.
These are available on the LBP website and include a detailed guidance document and an interactive online learning module. The module takes 20 to 30 minutes to complete and can count towards an LBP’s skills maintenance activities (LBPs must log in to the module for it to count towards skills maintenance).
This article is an excerpt from Codewords Issue 111. Reading Codewords articles that are relevant to your licence class is a mandatory requirement for Licensed Building Practitioners. These questions can be answered through the LBP portal, online on the Under Construction website or recorded on the magazine, then provided at the time of renewal.

We’re pleased to announce that our new website is now online and packed with features designed to make life a little bit easier
One of the biggest improvements is that LBPs will now be able to record, track and share their learning through the new ‘My LBP’ section. Here, LBPs can fill in their profile, see how they’re tracking in the ‘My Progress’ section, and view an overview of completed activities in the ‘My LBP Record’ section.
The ‘My Progress’ section is divided into two quiz categories – mandatory and elective. The percentage-complete graph is a great way to ensure you’re up to date on completing both types of quizzes. However, just because your graph says 100% doesn’t mean you can kick back until it’s time for your licence renewal. It’s updated as more quizzes become available, so make sure to keep logging in and completing the quiz sections!
The ‘My LBP Record’ section allows you to upload any extracurricular activities – such as attending a PlaceMakers seminar – to your record and provides a summary of all your skills maintenance. When it comes time to reapply for your licence, you can simply email, download or print off your ‘LBP Skills Summary’ and include it with your application as proof of skills maintenance activities.
Having the majority of your skills maintenance requirements in one place is even easier now that Codewords articles and quizzes, which account for 50% of the mandatory portion of the LBP scheme, are included in Under Construction. When you print out your learning record, completed Codewords quizzes will be separated out and clearly marked.
If you check your record and find you’ve fallen behind, don’t panic! The new website features six years’ worth of educational content and quizzes, which can be completed and recorded against your LBP Record at any time. The website is now also home to the past 12 issues of Under Construction, and we’ll continue uploading future issues to create an online library.

Updated and detailed Schedule 1 guidance for exempt building work was released following the November 2013 Building Act amendment – here is some further information on the exemptions and what it means for you.
As discussed in last month’s issue of Under Construction, a number of changes were made when Schedule 1 of the Building Act 2004 (the Act) was amended in November 2013.
In March this year, The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) published new guidance to help keep you up to date with the changes.
The guidance concentrates on the 43 exemptions of Schedule 1 and is full of practical examples and photos.
It’s important that builders are aware of building work that is exempt from a building consent, as your clients will often rely on you to advise them.
Carrying out building work that is not exempt, without a building consent, is an offence and can incur a fine of up to $200,000 and a further fine of up to $10,000 per day if work continues.
To find out more, read the guidance Building work that does not require a building consent – Building Act 2004 at www.dbh.govt.nz/bc-no-consent
Remember – all building work must comply with the Building Code, regardless of whether it needs a building consent. However, just because it doesn’t require a building consent doesn’t mean you have to go it alone.
If you’re unsure whether the building work is exempt, ask for advice from someone with the appropriate building knowledge and expertise such as:
Building consent authorities (typically district and city councils).
Registered architects.
Chartered professional engineers.
Registered building surveyors.
Building consultants.
Licensed building practitioners.
Registered certifying plumbers and/or drainlayers.
Talk to your council to see if it is prepared to exercise its discretion as to whether or not it requires a building consent (i.e. exemption 2). If the council does not require a consent, you may still need to apply in writing for an exemption from the council.
Apply for a building consent.
All building work, whether or not exempt, must still comply with the Building Code and all other relevant legislation, such as the Resource Management Act (RMA) 1991.
Always check with your local council for its District Plan rules (eg maximum site coverage, yard/setback requirements, sunlight access planes or permitted activities) set under the Resource Management Act 1991, as there are some discrepancies between Schedule 1 and local council requirements. If you need resource consent for the proposed building work, it’s important you get this before starting.
Find out more about the relationship between resource and building consents, how they may affect your project, and what you need to do to have your consents approved at: www.dbh.govt.nz/rma-guide-index
In the new guidance, each exemption is described in detail with examples, photos and, in some cases, diagrams. It also highlights any concerns to be aware of and clarifies the type of work that is exempt and who can carry it out. Below is an excerpt from the guidance regarding one of the exemptions.
1. The repair and maintenance of any component or assembly incorporated in or associated with a building, provided that comparable materials are used.
2. Replacement of any component or assembly incorporated in or associated with a building, provided that: (a) a comparable component or assembly is used; and (b) the replacement is in the same position.
3. However, subclauses (1) and (2) do not include the following building work: (a) complete or substantial replacement of a specified system; or (b) complete or substantial replacement of any component or assembly contributing to the building’s structural behaviour or fire-safety properties; or (c) repair or replacement (other than maintenance) of any component or assembly that has failed to satisfy the provisions of the building code for durability, for example, through a failure to comply with the external moisture requirements of the building code; or (d) sanitary plumbing or drainlaying under the Plumbers, Gasfitters, and Drainlayers Act 2006.
This exemption enables building owners to maintain their buildings, including carrying out any repairs or replacement, without having to get a building consent.
For further guidance on this exemption, we suggest you refer to the Ministry’s regular building controls newsletter Codewords, which often contains relevant examples.
The Ministry has also issued relevant determinations under the Building Act (eg Determinations 2013/058 and 2013/071) that include discussion about what is considered complete or substantial replacement and what is meant by comparable materials, components or assemblies.
Replacing a 20-year-old profile metal roof cladding (eg, corrugated iron or pressed metal tiles), where that cladding has achieved its Building Code durability requirement (ie, it lasted more than 15 years) and the replacement cladding is a comparable component or assembly (eg, profiled metal roofing).
Replacing old rotten wooden piles under a house with new treated timber piles in the same positions, as long as the work is not complete or substantial replacement.
Replacing a damaged fire sprinkler head in the same position in a commercial building. This work is not considered substantial, as only one fire sprinkler head is being replaced rather than the whole specified system.
Repairing and repainting damaged solid plaster exterior wall cladding, where the damage was not due to a durability failure (eg, it was caused by a motor vehicle backing into the wall).
Maintaining a weatherproofing membrane (eg, a fibreglass and painted surface system on an existing deck that forms the roof over a habitable room) by applying a new coat of fibreglass and paint in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions.
Replacing a damaged inner stainless steel flue for an existing solid fuel heater (eg, a wood burner) in the same position. As the undamaged outer flue liner is remaining and will continue to protect the building against the possible spread of fire, the scope of work is not considered to be complete or substantial replacement of a component that contributes to the building’s fire safety.
Replacing, in the same position, any number of existing non fire-rated wooden doors and windows (joinery and glazing) with new aluminium doors and windows.
Carrying out repairs or replacement work to a damaged brick chimney of a functioning open fireplace following an earthquake. The repair involves using comparable materials and the scope of work is not considered to be complete or substantial replacement of any components that contribute to the building’s structural behaviour or the fire safety of the building.
Repairing or replacing masonry veneer wall cladding (eg, brick or stone) which has been damaged, for example, by a large earthquake.
Replacing exterior wall cladding that has failed within 15 years of the cladding being installed, resulting in damage to the wall framing.
Rebuilding a house that has been significantly damaged by fire or earthquake. Although the building may have met its durability requirements under the Building Code, the proposed building work would involve complete and substantial replacement of structural components. Therefore, a building consent is required.
Repairing an exterior wall following vehicle impact damage where the repairs require complete replacement of wall framing and integral bracing elements.
Replacing an earthquake or fire damaged roof to a warehouse where the work includes the complete replacement of roof trusses that affect the building’s Examples where building consent is required.
Replacing old corrugated iron roofing with new concrete tiles. The new heavier tiles will impose an increased load on the existing structure which is likely to substantially affect the building’s structural behaviour.
Repositioning a solid-fuel heater (eg, a wood burner) by shifting it from one end of a living room to the other.
Replacing an existing solid-fuel heater with a comparable appliance in the same location. This will require a building consent as the installation will affect the building’s fire safety properties.

Updated and detailed Schedule 1 guidance for exempt building work has been released, following the November 2013 Building Act amendment – here’s the lowdown.
As discussed in last month’s issue of Under Construction, a number of changes were made when Schedule 1 of the Building Act 2004 (the Act) was amended in November 2013.
In March this year, The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) published new guidance to help keep you up to date with the changes.

To find out more, read the guidance Building work that does not require a building consent – Building Act 2004 at www.dbh.govt.nz/bc-no-consent
Remember – all building work must comply with the Building Code, regardless of whether it needs a building consent. However, just because it doesn’t require a building consent doesn’t mean you have to go it alone.
1. Does the proposed building work clearly fall within the scope of one or more of the exemptions (excluding exemption 2)? If you’re unsure whether the building work is exempt, ask for advice from someone with the appropriate building knowledge and expertise such as:
Building consent authorities (typically district and city councils).
Registered architects.
Chartered professional engineers.
Registered building surveyors.
Building consultants.
Licensed building practitioners.
Registered certifying plumbers and/or drainlayers.
2. If, after seeking advice, you decide the building work is outside exemptions 1, 3 to 43, what should you do?
Talk to your council to see if it is prepared to exercise its discretion as to whether or not it requires a building consent (i.e. exemption 2). If the council does not require a consent, you may still need to apply in writing for an exemption from the council.
3. If the council will not approve an exemption 2, what should you do?
Apply for a building consent.
All building work, whether or not exempt, must still comply with the Building Code and all other relevant legislation, such as the Resource Management Act (RMA) 1991.
Always check with your local council for its District Plan rules (eg maximum site coverage, yard/setback requirements, sunlight access planes or permitted activities) set under the Resource Management Act 1991, as there are some discrepancies between Schedule 1 and local council requirements.

In the new guidance, each exemption is described in detail with examples, photos and, in some cases, diagrams. It also highlights any concerns to be aware of and clarifies the type of work that is exempt and who can carry it out. Below is an excerpt from the guidance regarding one of the exemptions. All exemptions are described in similar detail, so make sure to take a close look.
Building work in connection with a window (including a roof window), or an exterior doorway, in an existing dwelling that is not more than two storeys, or in an existing outbuilding that is not more than two storeys, except:
(a) in the case of replacement, if the window or doorway being replaced has failed to satisfy the provisions of the building code for durability – for example, through a failure to comply with the external moisture requirements of the building code; or
(b) if the building work modifies or affects any specified system. This exemption allows you to carry out any building work in connection with a window (including a roof window, whether it is fixed or opening) or an exterior doorway without needing a building consent where it is an existing dwelling or outbuilding. That is as long as the original doorway or window has not failed prematurely and replacing it will not modify or affect any specified system (eg sprinklers or fire alarms).
If you are replacing a window, roof window or door, it is important to consider whether it originally met the durability requirements of the Building Code. In most cases, doors and windows in an external wall are required to last at least 15 years. Most windows and doors should achieve this requirement with regular maintenance.
If the door or window is older than 15 years and you are replacing it because it has rotted out, then this work will not require a building consent.
However, if you are replacing a window, roof window or door that has been installed within the last 15 years and it has failed (eg it has rotted out), this work will require a building consent. This recognises that replacing a window or door that has failed its durability requirements with a similar window or door could result in the replacement also failing.
All new building work must comply with the Building Code, including the structural performance requirements. Also note that, on completion of the building work, the altered building must comply with the Building Code to at least the same extent as it did before the building work was undertaken.
If you are considering building work that is close to or involves potentially load-bearing walls, it is important to get professional advice (eg from a chartered professional engineer, registered architect, building consultant or registered building surveyor).
Installing a roof window to an upper level apartment of a two-storey multi-unit dwelling (ie an apartment building). The skylight will be installed between the existing roof trusses without altering any specified systems.
A homeowner decides to replace a damaged, non fire-rated window that is 500 mm from the boundary. As the replacement window is within a metre of the boundary and as the new building work must comply with the Building Code, the window must provide adequate protection to the boundary (it could either be a fire-rated window or a non fire-rated window which is suitably protected; eg by a drencher system). The existing windows (which are non fire-rated) in the same wall can remain because the house still complies to the same extent as it did before the alteration (refer to section 42A(2)(b)(ii) of the Building Act).
Removing a dwelling’s lounge window and covering the opening with external cladding and internal linings to form a wall with no opening. Note that minimum Building Code requirements will still need to be met for ventilation, natural light and visual awareness of the outside environment.
Following earthquake damage, a builder decides to install a bi-fold door to replace a pair of French doors leading from the ground floor dining room of a two-storey dwelling. As the wall opening for the new joinery is wider than the existing opening, he needs to install a new lintel to span the opening.
To gain more sunlight, a home owner decides to install a window in an external fire-rated bedroom wall which contains no other openings. As the window will be less than 1 metre from the boundary, the owner instructs the builder to install a fire-rated window to meet the Building Code requirements.
A window installed in an existing outbuilding only six years ago needs to be replaced because of a rotten timber window frame. Replacing this window requires a building consent because it has failed its 15-year durability requirement.
The owner of a commercial building wants to install a roof window into an existing roof and ceiling to a top floor office. As this building is not a dwelling or outbuilding and as the roof window installation will affect the existing sprinkler system, a building consent is required.

As the Government has sought to introduce measures to make building easier and more affordable, it has also decided to investigate strengthening legislation to hold negligent builders accountable
Building and Construction Minister Chris Penk has proposed a range of measures designed to make building cheaper and faster, including reforming the consent process, removing barriers to overseas building products, making remote inspections standard procedure and reducing oversight for low-risk work – which will be offset by strengthened requirements for building professionals.
“For this to succeed, we must ensure that we have qualified tradespeople doing the work, standing by it and being accountable if things go wrong,” said Penk.
“The current registration and licensing regimes are not working as well as they could and, while the vast majority of tradespeople are competent, highly skilled professionals, a small minority are holding the sector back.”
Current deterrents aren’t working
Currently, penalties prescribed under the Building Act are not proportionate to the cost of remediating defect work and don’t do enough to deter tradies from cutting corners, said Penk.
“This lack of robust requirements also has an enormous flow-on effect, which means councils are more likely to be overly risk-averse out of fear that their ratepayers will be liable for paying the bill as the last man standing.”
Penk said the Government is looking at four ways to strengthen registration and licensing regimes:
Lifting the competence and accountability requirements for building professionals.
Improving consumer protection measures in the Building Act to provide the right support for consumers.
Ensuring regulators have the right powers to hold people to account with a focus on licensing, complaints, and disciplinary processes.
Introducing new penalties to deter bad behaviour. The Government is currently consulting on creating a new offence to deter deceptive behaviour during a remote inspection with a $50,000 penalty for individuals and $150,000 for businesses.

On 2 November 2023, the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) published updates to a series of acceptable solutions and verification methods
T his article details what has changed as a result of the latest updates and highlights important information that all Licensed Building Practitioners (LBPs) need to know. The changes included:
Plumbing and drainage.
Protection from fire.
Structural stability of hollow-core floors.
What has changed and how is it important to you?
The most important changes affecting LBPs are the updates to protection from fire for low-rise residential buildings in Acceptable Solution C/AS1 . This acceptable solution now requires interconnected smoke alarms throughout new residential buildings.
This change will significantly improve life safety without a big increase in construction costs. This update provides clarity on requirements for door lock devices, external safe paths and measuring travel distances to a final exit.
Interconnected smoke alarms
Following the feedback MBIE received during consultation, we have introduced interconnected smoke alarms as the minimum fire safety system in household units.
Interconnected smoke alarms work by sending a signal between the smoke detectors. If one smoke alarm detects a fire, all the smoke alarms in the home will sound an alarm. This update aims to bring New Zealand in line with the latest industry standards. We have cited NZS 4514:2021 , which sets out the requirements for the installation, maintenance and commissioning of interconnected smoke alarms. Smoke detectors will need to be installed in all bedrooms, living spaces, hallways and landings and, in multi-level dwellings, there must be at least one smoke alarm on each level. The standard provides recommendations on different types of detectors that can be used in different areas of a house to avoid nuisance alarms (such as in a kitchen).
The standard also provides options for different power supplies and includes wired smoke alarms or wireless smoke alarms with long-life batteries. A hard-wired interconnected smoke alarm system can be installed during construction while the house is being wired.
The new Acceptable Solution can be used today and has a one-year transition period ending in November 2024. Until then, the previous Acceptable Solution can be used for new building work. Homes or buildings which are renovated or have a change in use will also have to consider compliance with new requirements. For existing buildings, battery-operated interconnected smoke alarms can be installed without the need to rewire the home. This is a cost-effective solution that saves lives.
Means of escape
We have updated Part 3 of C/AS1 relating to means of escape and escape routes.
In C/AS1 escape routes include open paths, safe paths and final exits. There are limits on the height, width and length of escape routes in Sections 3.2 and 3.3. Open paths are generally the portion of the escape route inside the house or unit where occupants may be exposed to fire or smoke while making their escape.
There is a simplified method for measuring the length of open paths in paragraph 3.3.2.1. This generally occurs with multi-unit dwellings or sites with multiple buildings on them where occupants may have to travel past other units or buildings while making their escape. There are different ways an external safe path can be protected as these are given in subsection 3.3.5 and figure 3.3.5.3. Final exits are located at the end of open paths or at the end of the external safe path when people can safely disperse, such as onto a public street.
It is important to identify where the final exit is to ensure that open path lengths are not exceeded and that external safe paths are adequately protected along their entire length.
Door lock devices
As part of the update for C/AS1 we have issued clarification regarding door locks on escape routes. This means the door must be able to be opened from the inside without a key. This is something to consider when carrying out a renovation as there are a lot of modern locking devices on the market.
Plumbing and drainage
We have made changes to E1 Surface Water, G12 Water Supplies and G13 Foul Water . All plumbing work should be carried out by a qualified plumber, however it is important to be aware of these changes if you are managing a project.
Changes to Acceptable Solution G12/AS1 include measures to lower the maximum hot water temperature delivered at the tap for most buildings from 55°C to 50°C, and the introduction of additional temperature control devices to give plumbers more ways to limit hot water temperatures.
These changes do not apply to the hot water used for kitchen or laundries, nor do they apply to the temperature of hot water in the storage tank. The changes apply only to personal hygiene taps and baths in new buildings and new plumbing work.
The G12/AS1 update also includes reducing the lead content in plumbing products.
New documents
The update acceptable solutions and verification methods can be found on Building Performance website, along with further information on the 2022 Building Code update: building.govt.nz/building-code-compliance/annual-building-code-updates/2022-building-code-update
This article is an excerpt from Codewords Issue 116 and has been published verbatim. As such, neither PlaceMakers nor Under Construction magazine’s publishers take responsibility for the accuracy of the article or its corresponding questions.
Reading Codewords articles that are relevant to your licence class is a mandatory requirement for Licensed Building Practitioners. These questions can be answered through the LBP portal, online on the Under Construction website or recorded on the magazine, then provided at the time of renewal.

When completing and issuing records of work (RoWs), Licensed Building Practitioners (LBPs) have certain obligations
The Building Practitioners Board (the Board) continues to receive a high number of complaints about LBPs not issuing RoWs when they are required. Not providing a RoW is a poor reason to come before the Board, so ensure your records are up to date.
You can read more information on how RoWs should be used in Codewords Issue 71.
What are the rules?
Each LBP who carries out or supervises Restricted Building Work (RBW) must, on completion of the RBW, provide a RoW to the home owner and territorial authority (the local council). This requirement is set out in section 88 of the Building Act. It is also a disciplinary matter for LBPs if a RoW is not provided when one is required – meaning that you could be disciplined by the Board.
The record of work process.
What is a RoW for?
A RoW is designed to be a documented record of who carried out or supervised RBW under a building consent.
It protects you by listing only what you did, removing future uncertainty in situations where multiple contractors have performed or supervised RBW on one site. For this reason, the accuracy of the record is important as it will remain with the building records for the life of the building. It serves as an enduring and accurate record of RBW undertaken on-site.
How does this play out in practice?
When you have completed your portion of RBW on-site you should:
• Complete a RoW, either in the LBP portal or by using another valid method, such as the standard RoW form available on building.govt.nz. • Ensure the record is sufficiently detailed, so it describes each aspect of the RBW you either carried out or supervised (your role could include a combination of supervision and doing work). • Provide a copy of the RoW to both the home owner and to the local council.
What if you don’t provide a RoW?
You could face disciplinary action by the Board if you do not provide a RoW when one is required. You must not withhold a RoW for non-payment of work under a building contract, or simply because you are in dispute with the client.
Failure to provide a RoW is a disciplinary matter for which the Board has zero tolerance. For a more detailed overview of these requirements, please refer to the Board’s decision in C2 01170 .

Dishonesty convictions unearthed during LBP investigation lead to Building Practioner Board ordering longest licence cancellation to date
W airarapa builder Cecil Sinclair lost his status as an LBP after the Building Practitioners Board learnt of his convictions on 91 charges of tax evasion. These were uncovered during the investigation process, which took place after a complaint was received against Mr Sinclair.
The Board heard that Mr Sinclair’s tax evasion spanned a ten-year period, from 2001 to 2011. Mr Sinclair has a further 11 convictions in his criminal and traffic history going back as far as 1967, including five dishonesty offences.
The Board considered that Mr Sinclair’s convictions reflected adversely on his fitness to carry out and supervise building work, which often involves handling client funds or entering into credit arrangements.
Registrar of Building Practitioner Licensing Paul Hobbs says the Board’s decision should send a clear message that dishonest or fraudulent behaviour is not acceptable in today’s building industry.
“It’s important consumers are able to feel confident in the integrity of their licensed builder, and decisions such as this one help protect the strength and reputation of the industry as it grows,” he said.
Without LBP status, Mr Sinclair can no longer do or supervise restricted building work. This is work that is critical to the structure and durability of a residential building.
As part of the ruling, Mr Sinclair cannot apply to be relicensed as an LBP for at least three years – the longest cancellation period the Board has imposed to date. His name has been removed from the LBP register and he has been ordered to pay costs.
The LBP approval process currently includes a number of checks and balances, but not criminal record checks which is why Mr Sinclair’s convictions weren’t picked up when he acquired his licence.
Hobbs says that some other licensing schemes do carry out a criminal record check, and the LBP team is currently considering whether or not it should be part of the LBP application process.
This decision follows other significant Board decisions in 2015, where the Board took similar steps to discipline LBPs. Details of these decisions can be found on the MBIE Corporate website.
To read about the complaint and decision in full, see BPB Complaint No. C2-01244.

As part of our commitment to helping Licensed Building Practitioners earn their required skills maintenance points, we’ll be including all required Codewords articles in Under Construction
U nder the new skills maintenance scheme, reading Codewords articles and answering the corresponding questions is a compulsory part of skills maintenance – for those who have renewed their licence since 2 November 2015. Once you’ve read the article, found on the LBP website (under Codewords Issue 72), make sure to answer the associated questions.
Resource consents and what you need to know
You need to have a good working knowledge of the ‘rules’ that apply to any land you are working on, including the requirements of any resource consent.
A resource consent is authorisation from your local council to undertake certain works or activities on a piece of land. These works may affect the environment and natural surroundings (bush, land, water, sky and animals), or the people and community nearby (including streetscapes, light and noise aspects, and heritage considerations).
On a construction site, these activities may include:
Large-scale earthworks.
A building footprint larger or closer to a boundary than the district plan allows.
A new dwelling located in a flood-prone or contaminated area.
Works in close proximity to a watercourse, on a steep gradient, in a natural heritage area and/or in a coastal environment.
Resource consents come with a set of conditions that reduce the risks to the environment and community. Common conditions for a residential new build may include:
Sediment controls, such as silt fences and stabilised entrances.
Limiting on-site hours of work to prevent excessive noise in the community.
Certificates from trades such as engineers, surveyors and drainlayers.
Construction and traffic management plans.
Although you may not be the holder of the resource consent, you and your subcontractors are required to comply with its conditions while undertaking activities on site.
Failure to comply with the conditions can result in your site being shut down, fines or court action, or both.
Before you start working, obtain a copy of all consents from whoever engaged you to do the works, and ensure you understand the conditions. Contact your local council if you have any questions.
When you finish a project, make sure you review both the resource consent and building consent, and submit any required documents to council. These may include geotechnical reports, survey certificates, drainage plans or any report required under the consent.

Parts 1 and 2 of this MBIE series covered off several examples of exempt building work and some of the measurable exemptions. This part, the third and final in the Codewords series, will look at exemption 1.
Exemption 1 can be challenging for builders to navigate, because it often comes down to interpretation as opposed to an exact measurement.
As a brief recap from our previous articles, all building work requires a building consent, except for work covered by Schedule 1 of the Building Act 2004. MBIE has issued guidance on Schedule 1 with helpful and practical examples, which can be found under ‘Schedule 1 Guidance’ on www.building.govt.nz.
To avoid having to pay fines from councils or penalties from the Building Practitioners Board (the Board), it’s important to check whether you need a building consent before commencing any work by reading the guidance and contacting your local building consent authority (BCA).
The Board has considered a number of complaints that relate to work undertaken using Schedule 1 and has offered up the following advice:
Licensed Building Practitioners (LBPs) have to be cautious when making enquiries as to whether a building consent is required or not. It is recommended that, if they plan to rely on advice given by a BCA representative, LBPs should:
Disclose the full extent of the building work to be undertaken.
Seek to obtain the advice in writing so that they have a means of verifying it or, if written advice cannot be obtained, that they make a contemporaneous record of the enquiry and verbal response received.
If in doubt, seek professional advice as well from an engineer or similarly qualified person.
Exemption 1 – general repair, maintenance and replacement
Exemption 1 allows you to repair, maintain or replace building elements without needing to obtain a building consent provided a series of conditions is met. You cannot use this exemption on work that is sanitary plumbing work as this is covered by exemptions 32–38.
Condition 1
The repair and maintenance of any element incorporated in or associated with a building is exempt building work provided that comparable materials are used. This covers general repair and maintenance but does not cover repair or replacement of an element that has failed its durability requirement under the Building Code. This may include a failure to comply with the external moisture requirements of the Building Code (such as in a leaky building).
At a very high level, the Building Code Clause B2 durability requirements are:
Easy to access and replace elements such as coatings (paint) and light fittings must last a minimum of five years.
Moderately difficult to access and replace elements such as interior wall linings, claddings or windows must last a minimum of 15 years.
Difficult to access and replace elements, or critical components of a building, such as structural wall framing or foundations must last a minimum of 50 years.
The Building Code Clause B2 Durability document, which can be found on the www.building.govt.nz website, has further information.
Condition 2
Replacement of any element incorporated in or associated with a building is exempt building work, provided that a comparable element is used and the replacement is in the same position.
This is commonly referred to as a ‘like-for-like’ replacement, but this is not technically correct. You are able to use a comparable element (not necessarily the same type of element) provided it is in the same position.
Some older products might meet the ‘comparable’ test, but may not comply with the current Building Code. For example, you would not replace asbestos cladding with asbestos cladding, as you would breach Clause F2 Hazardous Building Materials.
The modern-day substitute is fibre-cement based sheet. If you are in any doubt, a useful test is provided in Verification Method B2/AS1. The assessment of comparability is about the level of performance for a product or element.
You cannot use this exemption if you are replacing an element contributing to the structural behaviour or fire safety properties, or most or all of a specified system (such as emergency lighting). You are also not able to use this exemption for replacement work that has failed its durability test as discussed above.
What does this actually mean?
This means that you can do a lot of repair, replacement or maintenance work without needing to obtain a building consent. It is a judgement call sometimes on whether your material is comparable, or whether the element you are replacing has failed its durability requirements under the Building Code. You’ll need to do some thinking before you use this exemption.
If you have any questions about using this exemption onsite – because it can be a little tough to come to a clear decision – we recommend that you either seek an ‘exemption 2’ from the council or you apply for a building consent rather than risk it. You can also check out the helpful examples in MBIE’s guidance document.
Real world learnings
It is important to remember that even if work doesn’t require a building consent, it still needs to be compliant with the Building Code. A good example is a roof replacement that was recently brought to MBIE’s attention. In this instance, the roofer in question elected to re-roof over an existing roof cladding. He did not obtain a building consent because he decided that Exemption 1 in Schedule 1 applied. This was not an issue.
However, he did not do a Building Code compliant or quality job, so the building work failed to meet the performance requirements of the Building Code. As a result, the LBP was disciplined by the Building Practitioners Board and had his licence cancelled – not because he used Exemption 1 of Schedule 1 when he shouldn’t have, but because the work was not up to standard.

Undertaking supervision is an important role and it is important all LBPs consider the practical and legal implications of performing this function
The Building Act 2004 in section 7, defines what it means to ‘supervise’ building work:
Supervise, in relation to building work, means provide control or direction and oversight of the building work to an extent that is sufficient to ensure that the building work:
is performed competently; and
complies with the building consent under which it is carried out.
Only Licensed Building Practitioners (LBPs) can supervise Restricted Building Work (RBW), and only that which they are licensed to carry out themselves. For example, an LBP with a carpentry licence can supervise non-LBPs doing carpentry RBW but cannot supervise a non-LBP doing blocklaying RBW.
Can an LBP supervise another LBP?
An LBP cannot supervise another LBP undertaking work in the same licence class. LBPs are legally entitled to carry out RBW and are always individually accountable for the work they themselves produce. The LBP who completes RBW must also be the one who completes a Record of Work afterwards.
Different types of supervision
There are three different types of supervision – direct, general and remote. The supervising LBP needs to consider both the work being done and who is carrying it out to be able to gauge the level of direction and control necessary – it is important to remember that the LBP supervising RBW is accountable for that work and must complete a Record of Work.
Complex tasks involving risky details being undertaken by low or semi-skilled workers require direct supervision or working one-on-one with them. An example of this might be an apprentice installing weatherboards for the first time.
However, if the person doing the work has previously demonstrated the ability to perform the task with limited supervision, then general supervision may be adopted – with the supervising LBP working in a different area on the same site but periodically checking the work as it proceeds.
Remote supervision could be used when an LBP knows that the non- licensed workers carrying out RBW on a different site are highly skilled. It is important the LBP identifies specific tasks when he or she needs to be onsite to provide direction or oversight even when they can’t be there constantly due to running more than one job at that time. With remote supervision, good lines of communication must be available so that advice and assistance can be offered when and where required.
Design supervision
When a new graduate is undertaking Design RBW, direct or general supervision would probably be used when the design LBP is working in the same office.
Where a competent but unlicensed designer who is well known to the supervising LBP works in a different office, remote supervision would be appropriate and would be provided primarily by phone or email. As the supervising LBP is going to be providing a statement about the Building Code in their certificate of work (CoW), dialogue with the non- LBP throughout the design process is essential.
Records and certificates of work
It is crucial that the LBP accurately completes their Record of Work or CoW, outlining what work was carried out or supervised – there is plenty of space to do this on the form. These forms will be held at the council for the life of the building they relate to, therefore having an accurate record is in the best interests of the LBP. You are unlikely to remember what you did on a particular job years from now, so accuracy is important.
Site licences
Though not directly linked to carrying out or supervising RBW, the Site licence is a critical part of the overall scheme. Holders of a Site licence are practitioners, who are recognised as possessing specific skills that relate to coordination, oversight, organisation and managing building projects. The Site licence is an indicator that you have the skills to manage personnel and provide technical site supervision within the scope of your licence. The
Site licence holder undertakes supervision of general building work, rather than the supervision of unlicensed people undertaking RBW.
What does poor supervision look like?
Poor supervision can involve poor onsite health and safety records, disorganised and untidy sites, little or no quality assurance, poor sequencing resulting in rescheduling of work, missed milestones or handover targets, or disgruntled staff or clients. It can result in failed building inspections, poor quality workmanship, and re-work – all of which are going to reflect badly on the supervising LBP. It is an offence to supervise in a negligent or incompetent manner, and you could be held to account.
Good supervision
Good supervision requires a solid understanding of your co-workers’ skills and the complexity of work being performed, alongside the right mix of control, direction and oversight.
Just being licensed does not mean you are capable of supervising non-LBPs carrying out RBW. It may be difficult for newly licensed practitioner with only a few years’ experience to supervise a non- licensed tradesperson with 40 years’ experience.
It all comes down to competence and not being afraid to say: “I need more experience before I can competently do that”.
The above is taken from the Practice Note on supervision.
This article is an excerpt from Codewords Issue 115 and has been published verbatim. As such, neither PlaceMakers nor Under Construction magazine’s publishers take responsibility for the accuracy of the article or its corresponding questions.
Reading Codewords articles that are relevant to your licence class is a mandatory requirement for Licensed Building Practitioners. These questions can be answered through the LBP portal, online on the Under Construction website or recorded on the magazine, then provided at the time of renewal.

Landlords will soon have to comply with healthy homes standards. If you are asked to carry out work to help with compliance, there are several information sources you will find useful
Cold, damp and mouldy houses are bad for our health – especially for people with asthma and heart conditions. The healthy homes standards, which were made law in 2019, aim to ensure that all people in rental properties live in a warm, dry home.
Changes kick in on 1 July 2021
The standards establish minimum requirements for heating, moisture ingress and drainage, insulation, ventilation and draught stopping.
Compliance deadlines for the standards start from 1 July 2021, only one month away. The responsibility for complying with the healthy homes standards sits with landlords. Landlords should be acting now to ensure they comply. Staying informed about the standards enables you to assist landlords in making the right decisions on the work they need done to get their properties to comply.
Know about the insulation standard
The insulation standard is one of the areas covered by the healthy homes standards, and it is important to be aware of it. New Zealand already has minimum insulation requirements, and the healthy homes standards build on these, so some existing insulation may need to be topped up or replaced.
All existing insulation must be in reasonable condition to meet the requirements. This means there should be no mould, dampness, damage or gaps, and all insulation must be installed in accordance with NZS 4246:2016 Energy efficiency – Installing bulk thermal insulation in residential buildings .
Where to direct landlords
If landlords ask you questions about the standards, you can point them to the Tenancy Services website, which has plenty of information. There is an insulation tool available at www.tenancy.govt.nz/maintenance-and-inspections/insulation that can help landlords find out if they need to upgrade or replace the insulation to meet the healthy homes standard.
There is also an online guidance document, Healthy homes standards – Insulation , available at www.tenancy.govt.nz/healthy-homes/insulation-standard/ to help assess whether a property is compliant. It may be useful for you to look at the guidance document as it has details about the technical requirements that need to be met to ensure compliance.
Be aware of other requirements
It can also pay to be aware of the healthy homes standards outside your area of work or expertise. As these standards are often implemented in the same area of the home, it is possible to undo the work completed by other tradespeople to comply with the rest of the standards if you do not know what to look for.
For example, electrical workers may pull out insulation to install wiring in the roof space and not put it back correctly, which can seriously impact the home and its compliance with the insulation standard. While electrical workers are simply doing their job, they may be unaware of the need to maintain compliance with all five of the healthy homes standards.
By being aware of the other standards and keeping this top of mind while undertaking work, you can help the landlord maintain compliance with the standards.
More information:
This article is published in conjunction with Tenancy Services whose website provides quick, informative explanations of each standard – see www.tenancy.govt.nz/healthy-homes

MBIE’s new consumer protection guidance for builders details and explains the new regulations
New consumer protection measures, included in the Building Amendment Act 2013, came into force on 1 January 2015.
According to MBIE, the new measures have been adopted in response to consumers having little ability to distinguish between practitioners who have a good business history and repeatedly turn out quality building work, and those who use low-skilled labour, take shortcuts and do not stand behind their work. This type of behaviour creates an imbalance in the sector, as poorly performing practitioners often experience competitive advantage over their better-performing counterparts.
“A default clause won’t override an existing clause in your contract on a similar topic
MBIE suggests that this is largely due to consumers often selecting building contractors on the basis of price alone, with little value placed on a practitioner’s overall credentials and in-service track record. The Government seeks to rebalance this lack of transparency through the implementation of the new consumer protection measures.
To outline the new measures and reiterate other changes that have occurred over the past two years, guidance has been released. It is divided into four parts:
New consumer protection measures
Before building work starts
Once building work finishes
What if things go wrong?
Under Construction will feature this content over the next few editions, as well as the ‘Guide to Tolerances’ when it is released later in the year.
By law, all contracts for $30,000 or more must contain key information. Your contract must include the following:
Names, physical and postal addresses (including the address for the delivery of notices) of both parties, and all relevant contact details (eg phone numbers and email addresses).
The address or location description of the site where the building work will be carried out.
The date(s) the contract has been signed by both parties.
The expected start and completion date and how possible delays will be dealt with.
The contract price or the method by which the contract price will be calculated (eg fixed hourly rate with materials invoiced separately by the supplier).
A description of the building work that you will complete including the materials and products to be used (if known).
Which party will be responsible for obtaining building consents, and any other approvals required, to carry out the building work.
Who will be carrying out and/or supervising the building work.
How notices and certificates will be given by one party to the other.
The payment process, including dates or stages for payment and how payments will be invoiced, made and receipted.
How defects in the building work will be remedied, including reference to the existence and application of the implied warranties in sections 362I to 362K of the Building Act.
The dispute resolution process to be followed if there is a disagreement.
How variations to the building work covered by the contract will be agreed before work continues.
An acknowledgement that the client has received the checklist and disclosure statement.
*The above is the minimum content required in the contract, which only covers the basics. Take time to make sure your contract is suitable for the building work you are undertaking. We also recommend getting legal advice about what should be in it.
You can purchase NZS 3902:2004 Housing, Alterations and Small Business contract from Standards New Zealand at www.standards.co.nz .
Check with your industry association (if you are a member) as they may have a standard form contract you can use.
Ask your lawyer about creating your own contract and make sure it covers all the required minimum clauses.
We also recommend you talk to your lawyer before signing a contract for a particular project.
NOTE: You can be fined $500 for not having a written contract with the homeowner if it’s required.
If you haven’t met your requirements under the Building Act and don’t have a written contract, or if the contract doesn’t include the minimum content specified in the Act, there are new default clauses that will automatically be considered to be part of your contract. These clauses only apply if you don’t have a written contract or if there is no clause on the same topic in your contract. Put another way, a default clause won’t override an existing clause in your contract on a similar topic. The default clauses cover many aspects of a building project; including that the contractor is responsible for obtaining all consents and approvals on behalf of the client, and that the contractor may not submit a final payment claim until the Code Compliance Certificate has been provided.

Aotearoa New Zealand Disability Rights Commissioner Paula Tesoriero states her case as to why universal design solutions for housing must be embraced
About 24% of our population identify as disabled – that’s roughly 1m people in Aotearoa New Zealand. Despite this, around 130,000 disabled people in this country live in homes that don’t fully meet their needs.
That figure is likely to increase as our population ages, however so much of our built environment excludes disabled people because of its design. Many disabled people are not able to live in houses suitable to their needs or access buildings in the way non-disabled people can – routinely and easily.
A study by Lifemark ® (a division of CCS Disability Action), looked at the application of the principles of universal design (UD) in new homes. It found that three key features of accessibility – level pathways and entrances, an easily accessible bathroom on the ground floor, and wide doorways – were found in just 5% of new homes, while only 2% of new homes would comply with Lifemark’s ® higher standards of accessibility. The study also found that one in six people need modifications to their home.
As the Disability Rights Commissioner, my role is to protect and promote the rights of disabled people. Those rights are set out in both the NZ Bill of Rights Act, and the Human Rights Act. This country is also a signatory to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities, and these elements combined bring a collective responsibility.
Universal Design
Universal design (UD) solutions future-proof buildings for the modern world so anyone can use them – and no one is excluded. UD principles marry uber-functionality with aesthetics – homes built to these principles can easily be visually attractive as well as functional and practical. Universally designed structures work for all of us, at any stage or age. From a disability-rights perspective, universal design is truly fundamental to building an inclusive society.
Lead building practitioners and designers may be in a challenging position. Even though they may see the functional and aesthetic benefits of UD, clients may be reluctant or unable to extrapolate the longer-term benefits and assume considerable additional costs. From a societal perspective, this view is short-sighted because UD is all about making structures work for most people – and that includes disabled people.
Vastly reduced costs long-term
According to building research body BRANZ, it’s more expensive to retrofit a structure than to build it from scratch using UD principles. Its research found the cost of incorporating essential UD features on a new house (150-200 m2) was just $1,700, compared to $14,000 for a retrofit. It also found that, in most cases, the extra costs of incorporating UD solutions is about 0.5% of the total build cost.
BRANZ also endorses universal design because its concepts and solutions ‘make sense’ as buildings designed with these principles are more attractive to a wider group of buyers. See BRANZ’s website for a universal design calculator.
It can be done
The New Zealand Disability Strategy (2016 to 2026) is a roadmap to help implement the UN Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities. The strategy aims to influence and regulate for the kind of changes I’m advocating and lays out the outcomes that local councils, planners, designers and builders can contribute to.
There are some good examples of local government leading on UD initiatives. The Thames Coromandel District Council incentivised new builds using UD solutions after modelling showed the district’s population was aging and it was more cost effective for builders to get it right the first time than to retrofit homes to suit its aging population.
Hamilton City Council is incentivising developers to achieve Lifemark ® certification in residential developments in the central city, while Palmerston North City Council’s Lifemark ® 4 star Papaioea Place project will have 76 new homes. Hauraki District Council has also incentivised UD in recognition of the need to be designing homes that cater for the needs of the elderly and disabled people in our communities.
Our society is undergoing quite rapid social and cultural change. The building industry could grasp this opportunity to promote UD as mainstream and there is an opportunity to pivot from a one-size-fits-all approach in our built environment to creating adaptive and inclusive structures that stand the test of time. What a great legacy to leave.
My aspiration as Disability Rights Commissioner is to have 100% UD for all new government new builds and eventually for all new builds. That’s because I view this as not just about the design of housing – it’s about creating an accessible world with infrastructure that supports disability and diversity. As a social indicator, housing is something we need to do better in.
If you are interested in reading more about accessible housing, check out the NZ Human Rights website.

The ever-growing range of building products on the market comes with concern that not all are what they claim to be or even meet New Zealand Building Code requirements. What is MBIE doing to address this issue?
MBIE has a mandate to monitor the building product market and investigate complaints when products don’t comply with the Building Code.
MBIE monitors and investigates
Monitoring the market can establish whether there is a widespread problem with a product that could affect a significant number of buildings, should it continue to be supplied and used in building work.
An investigation by MBIE might result in:
A formal warning or ban issued on the use of the product.
Guidance issued to the industry.
More education provided to those involved in manufacturing, supplying, specifying or installing building products.
Tell us if you have concerns
If you have a complaint about a building product, or are concerned that a building product doesn’t comply with the Building Code, you can get in touch with MBIE.
If the complaint is about false   or misleading information or unsubstantiated claims, MBIE may refer the complaint to the Commerce Commission if it falls within its jurisdiction.
The MBIE products team works alongside other teams within MBIE, such as Trading Standards, which ensures safe products, accurate measurement and quality fuel, and other government organisations and licensing boards such as WorkSafe, the Ministry of Health and the Plumbers, Gasfitters and Drainlayers Board.
Supply information and evidence
Often product complaints lack enough specific detail or evidence, which makes it difficult for MBIE to get a clear picture of the problem or take further action.
For MBIE to investigate a complaint, the following information is required:
The name of the building product.
Where it was purchased or who it was supplied by, if this is known.
Compliance information available for the product from the manufacturer or supplier, such as test reports, assessments or calculations, claims of compliance and technical information.
The reasons why you believe the product does not comply with the Building Code.
Evidence of failure, such as photographs or locations where the product was used.
Information you think supports an investigation.
Please send the information and the complaint to:
products@mbie.govt.nz
Or post to:
Building System Assurance – Products   Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment   PO Box 1473   Wellington 6011
All information received by MBIE is public information and, if requested, the details of your complaint may have to be released to other individuals or organisations under the Official Information Act 1982.
To find out more, visit www.building.govt.nz and search for`product assurance´.

It can be difficult to understand the requirements for joints in top plates – below are some pointers on best practice for top plate connections
Specific requirements for joints in top plates are set out in section 8.7.3 of NZS 3604:2011 Timber-framed buildings .
All joints in top plates must be made over a support, such as a stud or solid blocking between studs. Other criteria for joints depend on whether the wall:
Is braced (either in-line or a wall intersecting with it is braced).
Contains no bracing elements.
Each of these situations is covered off below.
Many methods require a fixing of a certain strength or capacity, measured in kN (kilonewtons).
Walls with bracing – in-line connections
For single-storey buildings, the capacity of joint connections in top plates of walls with one or more bracing elements is based on the highest bracing element in the wall. The connections must be in both tension and compression along the plate and have the following capacities:
3kN capacity connections are required for walls containing up to 100 bracing units (BUs).
6kN capacity connections are required for walls containing more than 100 BUs.
6kN capacity connections are required for walls with a ceiling diaphragm.
Figures 2 (a) and (b) give further detail.
The 3kN and 6kN connections can be made using metal connection plates or nailed joints with fixings (see Table 1). However, if an extra top plate is used and the joints are not aligned with the lower top plate, the 3kN or 6kN capacity connections are not normally required as long as there is at least a 3kN/6kN nailed joint connection (as appropriate) between top plate pairs.
Walls with bracing – right angle connections
Internal walls containing one or more bracing elements must be connected to external walls that are at right angles to them at the top plate level. Connections in tension and compression along the line of the wall bracing element may be direct (Figure 3(a)), or through framing members (such as truss bottom chords, ceiling joists or ceiling battens) that are in line with the braced wall (Figure 3(b)).
Each internal wall must have a connection capacity as follows:
6kN connection to at least one external wall is required for a wall with up to 125 BUs.
6kN connections to at least two external walls are required for a wall with up to 250 BUs.
Minimum connection capacities of 2.4kN per 100 BUs to at least two external walls are required for a wall with more than 250 BUs.
Figure 4 demonstrates the various options
In-line connections in top plates
For the in-line connections at M2, N2, N3 and O2 in Figure 4, if the total BUs in the bracing lines M, N or O are:
Less than 100 BUs, use 3 kN capacity connections.
More than 100 BUs, use 6 kN capacity connections.
If a double top plate is used and joints in the top plates are staggered, neither the 3kN or 6kN capacity connections are required according to NZS 3604 .
Right angle connections in top plates
For the right-angle connections at M1 and O1 in Figure 4, if the wall on bracing line A has:
Up to 250 BUs, then 6kN connections are required at each end of line A .
More than 250 BUs, then connections at each end of line A must have a capacity of at least 2.4kN per 100 BUs.
For connections at N1 and N4, if the wall on bracing line N has:
Up to125 BUs, then 6kN connections to an external wall is required.
Up to 250 BUs, then there must be 6kN connections to each end of the wall at both external walls are required.
More than 250 BUs, then a fixing capacity of 2.4kN per 100 BUs of the wall at both external walls is required.
Right angle walls that are laterally supported
The connection requirements of the wall on bracing line B to the external wall in Figure 4 depend on the amount of bracing in wall B:
If there is no bracing in wall B, a 3kN connection, or a halved or a butt joint over a stud or blocking may be used at B1.
If the bracing does not exceed 125 bus, use a 6kN connection at B1.
If there are between 125 and 250 bus, a 6kN connection is required at B1 and the wall must be connected to external wall O with the bottom chord of a truss or with a ceiling joist between B2 and B3 using a 6kN connection.
If there are more than 250 bus, the connection at B1 must be 2.4kN per 100 bus and the wall must be connected to external wall O with the bottom chord of a truss or with a ceiling joist between B2 and B3 using a 6kN connection.
Top plates required for lateral support
Top plates must be laterally supported by any one of the following:
A sheet ceiling lining with a minimum density of 600 kg/m 3 .
Intersecting top plates, joists, rafters, trusses or purlins.
Framing members at maximum 2.5m spacings.
70 x 45 mm connecting members (Figure 5).
If the ceiling has a density of less than 600kg/m 3 (such as softboard) and the distance between bracing lines is between 5–6 m, a 90 x 45 mm top plate must have an additional 140 x 35 mm top plate.
Walls with no bracing elements
A joint made in the top plate of a wall that contains no bracing elements, in-line or at a wall intersection, can be any one of the following:
A halved and nailed joint (Figure 1(a)).
A butted and nailed joint over blocking (Figure 1(b)).
A joint with an alternative fixing with at least 3kN capacity in compression or tension (see table 1 for kN references).

P laceMakers’ fifth round of skills maintenance seminars aims to keep builders up to date with the myriad of changes that have already taken place – and those potentially just around the corner.
The new presenter John Tait, who will be familiar to some of you as presenter of a number of seminars in the last skill maintenance series, brings years of varied building experience and a fresh perspective to PlaceMakers’ ongoing skills maintenance programme.
“Skills maintenance is about ensuring you’re aware of the industry changes that affect your work on a day-to-day basis and we’ll do our best to explain those in an easy-to-digest format,” says John.
Coming from a trade background, John holds a national diploma in construction management and has been in the industry for twenty years. He previously worked as a building inspector, a technical advisor for the Department of Building and Housing and even worked at PlaceMakers Evans Bay for seven years in the yard, panel store, hardware store and trade sales office.
John currently provides a range of building consultant services to owners and councils around the country and says he is looking forward to meeting attendees and helping them manage the significant changes still taking place in the construction industry.
Some of the aspects he’ll be focusing on include Building Act Amendment No 4, the Construction Contracts Act, the Earthquake Prone Building Policy, the Law Commission review of joint and several liability and a number of recent Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment guides such as the ‘ Guidance on the use of Certificates of Work, Producer Statements and Design Features by Chartered Professional Engineers under the new Restricted Building Work regime ’ and ‘ External moisture – a guide to using the risk matrix ’.
So, attend a seminar near you and build on the skills maintenance points you’ve been collecting by reading Under Construction .

Last issue we covered the basics of Certificates of Work. In this article, we go into more detail about how to include multiple contributors in your documentation
Design can be a collaborative process, especially on more challenging projects. Sometimes a piece of specialty design will be included in your overall design. Whether you have complex foundation designed by a civil engineer, or have included pre-fabricated timber trusses, if another designer has designed Restricted Building Work (RBW) it will need to be included in Certificate of Work (CoW) documentation.
Who can issue a CoW?
Professionals who are licensed or registered to be able to do design RBW can provide CoW for that work. This includes:
Licensed Building Practitioners with a Design Licence.
Registered architects (NZRAB).
Chartered Professional Engineers (CPEng).
Under current regulation CPEng (under the Chartered Professional Engineers of New Zealand Act 2002) and registered architects (under the Registered Architects Act 2005) are automatically treated as LBPs licensed in the design class Area of Practice 3. Registered Architects and Chartered Professional Engineers have their own registration bodies that manage their registration and oversee their professional conduct.
Collaborative design
Where two or more LBPs (or other suitably registered professional) are involved in carrying out or supervising the design work for a building consent application involving RBW, there may be a choice about who provides the CoW(s). If a particular design is both carried out and supervised by LBPs licensed in design, the CoW could be provided by either the LBP that carried out the design work or the one that supervised it. However, if two designers work on different aspects of the plans and specifications that are RBW (eg, one designs the foundation and another designs elements of the superstructure), then each designer would be expected to provide a CoW for their respective parts.
Producing and signing a CoW means a designer is providing a statutory undertaking, certifying that the design documents are compliant to the Building Code. You can provide a CoW that covers other LBP designers’ work but it is important to be aware that, in this context, the one who signs the CoW is taking responsibility via that certification statement. The work you are being asked to sign off may not be compliant with the Building Code, so make sure you do your due diligence before signing.
Including Producer Statements
A producer statement is a document prepared by a Chartered Professional Engineer confirming their professional opinion. This opinion is based on stated reasonable grounds that aspects of design of a building achieve compliance with the Building Code, or that elements of construction have been completed in accordance with the approved building consent. The producer statement contains the name of the engineer and their firm to signal to the Building Consent Authority that certain design/monitoring work has been done (or overseen/supervised) by a practitioner who is competent to perform the defined work. However, a Producer Statement is not a product warranty or guarantee of compliance. It is a professional opinion based on sound engineering judgment.
An LBP may reference a producer statement in a CoW when an engineered element has been used in a design. An example of this could be when factory designed and built trusses are incorporated in a design. The LBP would specify the truss and ensure it was fit for purpose in the overall design; however, the detailed design was carried out by the truss producer, so the Producer Statement could be referred to in the CoW for that section of the design.
Where a Producer Statement has been used to support the demonstration of Building Code compliance, it should be cited in the ‘reference column’ of the CoW, along with other relevant specifications and reports (ie, geotechnical engineering report).
Further Guidance
Further guidance on the use of Certificates of Work, Producer Statements, and Design Features Reports relating to RBW can be found at:
www.building.govt.nz/building-code-compliance-canterbury-rebuild/certificates-of-work-guidance
This particular guidance document was developed for practitioners working on the Canterbury rebuild; however, the same principles apply for design RBW anywhere in New Zealand. More information about Producer Statements can also be found on the engineering New Zealand website www.engineeringnz.org

TITLE   : First LBP licence cancellation
CATEGORY: lbp_regulation

The Building Practitioner’s Board cancels LBP’s licence for ‘carrying out building work in an incompetent manner’.
Nearly six years after the Licensed Building Practitioner (LBP) scheme was created, and almost two years after Restricted Building Work (RBW) came into effect, an LBP has gone through the complaints process and had both his licences cancelled as a result.
The respondent, whose name cannot be published, is the first practitioner to have his licence cancelled. While a number of LBPs have had their licences suspended – mostly voluntarily or due to not renewing them in time – this is the first instance where a complaint has been upheld and resulted in a licence cancellation.
The LBP in question (who we will refer to as Mr X) was contracted to build a deck of approximately 24 m2. Construction, which commenced on 7 September 2011, continued until about 30 October 2011. However, Mr X only acquired his Site (Area of Practice 1) licence on 26 September 2011, and his Design (area of Practice 2) licence on 18 October of the same year.On 22 November 2011, the person who contracted Mr X to carry out the deck work (who we will call Ms Y) lodged a complaint with the Building Practitioners’ Board (the Board). At this time the deck was still incomplete.
“While a number of LBPs have had their licenses suspended, this is the first instance where a complaint has been up held and resulted in a license cancellation
Ms Y complained about three issues – using second-hand and old timber when the builder quoted new timber, not carrying out work in accordance with his quotation and substandard quality of work. The first two complaints are contractual matters and therefore not relevant ground for the Board to consider a complaint.
However, the third issue – substandard quality of work completed by an LBP – was relevant and, after being reviewed by the Registrar, was passed onto the Board for review.
The report was carried out by William Hursthouse, the special investigator for the Board.
The investigator looked into the following concerns regarding the quality of the building work:
1)    The stringer or ribbon board was fixed directly to the house cladding and not packed off the recommended 12mm to provide free drainage, which could result in premature deterioration of the cladding.
2)   Parts of the structure wereinadequate:
Bolts were rusting.
Structural members were not in contact with each other at joints to provide load transfer.
Inadequate-sized round washers had been used causing crushing of timber.
Bearers were not bolted to posts.
3)   There were significant gaps between bearers and joists, which would result in sagging because the joists were not adequately supported.
4)    Posts were not in line or parallel to the edge of the deck.
5)    The spans of some beams were beyond the maximums recommended in NZS 3604:2011.
6)   Some foundations did not appear to have been dug to solid ground.
Complaint’s response:
When the Board questioned Mr X about these issues, he said he was planning to remedy some of the issues when he returned to complete the work, but also admitted that he was quite unaware of several Building Code requirements and that he relied heavily on the building consent authority’s review of his designs to ensure they were compliant.
Given building a deck is considered low-risk work, and therefore does not require a building consent, no one reviewed his design and he said he was unaware of the compliance requirements when building work did not require a building consent.
The building work was carried out by Mr X with the assistance of others. While Mr X does not, and did not, hold a Carpentry licence, he does not need to as building a deck is not Restricted Building Work. Nonetheless, as the holder of a Site licence, the LBP Rules state that he had a responsibility to oversee the work and “apply technical knowledge of construction methods and practice”, as well as to “supervise personnel at the worksite”. He was also required to “supervise the installation of all structural elements”.
After considering the submissions by Mr X, Ms Y, the Registrar and the special investigator’s report, the Board found the following:
“Given the poor quality of the construction work identified by the evidence, failure to meet the requirements of E2/AS1 and NZS 3604:2011 , and failure to ensure adequate structural connection between members to achieve load transfer, Mr X demonstrated a lack of ability and the skills reasonably expected of a Licensed Building Practitioner to carry out the work. Hence the charge that he “has carried out or supervised building in an incompetent manner” has been proved to the Board’s satisfaction.”
As a result, the Board reserved the right make a decision regarding Mr X’s disciplinary penalty. In this case, the Board decided that given the fact he built a deck despite being unaware of both basic and critical requirements for such work, it was necessary to cancel both his licences. He was also fined $1,500 to go towards the costs of, and incidental to, the inquiry of the Board. However, considering the work was carried out almost two years prior, and his likely gains in experience and competence since, he was allowed to reapply within a relatively short time period.
This decision serves as a reminder that all building work must comply with the Building Code even if a consent is not required.
Any building or building inspection work you carry out can be subject to a complaint to the Building Practitioners Board – even something as simple as a low deck.
The Building Practioner’s Board did not address the complainant’s other concerns – using second-hand and old timber when he quoted new timber and not carrying out work in accordance with his quotation – which refer to contractual matters and are not relevant grounds for the Board to consider a complaint.

The current shortage of products means builders are increasingly turning to alternatives. This can be potentially problematic and MBIE has recently released specific guidance on what products can be substituted for plasterboard
It has been well documented that Aotearoa New Zealand is currently facing a shortage of plasterboard and other commonly used building products. This is largely due to supply chain issues associated with the downstream effects of Covid-19 and elevated levels of demand.
Consequently, there is an increased possibility that some building products specified as part of a building consent may need to be substituted with a similar or comparable product.
A first-principles approach
The Building Code sets the minimum performance requirements that all building work must meet. However, it does not prescribe which materials, building methods or products to use.
Designers and homeowners can choose the product that fits their requirements if they can provide evidence that it complies with the relevant performance requirements of the Building Code.
MBIE’s plasterboard-specific guidance
MBIE recently released the guidance document Product Substitution – plasterboard for building consent authorities (BCAs), designers, contractors and building owners to better support them in using building products that differ from those originally requested by owners and specified in building consent applications.
It outlines a pathway to product substitution and compliance for plasterboard and other wallboard products and is best read in conjunction with the more general Product substitution guidance published by MBIE in November 2021.
The guidance was developed in conjunction with BCAs with a view to managing the approval of plasterboard substitution in a more nationally consistent manner.
In addition, MBIE has published the step-by-step guide for plasterboard product substitution, showing the roles played by manufacturers, designers, building consent officers and builders.
Three-step approach
The plasterboard product substitution guidance lays out a three-step approach consistent with MBIE’s broader product substitution guidance:
It encourages people to consider the legal context, particularly any additional obligations and compliance-related matters that might arise from a product substitution.
It points to the broader implications of using a different product to that specified, including whether it is fit for the same purpose and still meets the owner’s needs.
It talks people through how to implement changes to consent – or example, if substituting the product requires a minor variation or, for more-complex changes, it might trigger an amendment to the building consent.
In summary, it also:
Outlines and encourages the use of the minor variation process for substituting plasterboard.
Lists those products that can be substituted as a minor variation.
Explains what should be considered when substituting plasterboard that has:
Standard performance requirements when used as lining only.
Additional performance requirements such as a substrate lining in areas subject to water splash in bathrooms and kitchens or as an element within a fire-protection system, a sound-rated system or a bracing system.
Advises what can be done in the design stage to avoid the need for product substitution – the consideration of other products and construction methods.
Provides an appendix of links to other product information that may be of use to show compliance with the building code.
All parties have a role to play
A designer or builder who wishes to substitute a building product should ensure that:
The customer is informed about and has agreed to the substitution taking place.
They provide adequate evidence so the BCA can be satisfied on reasonable grounds that the building work will continue to comply with the building code.
They are on site to talk to the building control officer (or are available in the event that it is a remote inspection) about the proposed substitution and provide documentation if this is requested.
Failure to provide sufficient information may lead to delays in assessing variations or rejection of the application or require an amendment to the building consent to be applied for.
Try to avoid the need to substitute in the first place
Most designers will already be trying to avoid specifying products likely to need to be substituted at the construction phase.
As a reminder, designers should check on the availability of products in short supply and consider whether any of the following are more readily available and could be suitable alternatives:
Other readily available plasterboard products.
Non-plasterboard panel systems such as plywood.
Alternative construction systems.

PlaceMakers continues to evolve to serve the changing needs of the industry
You don’t need me to tell you that the building industry has changed significantly over the past five years – with it, so have builders’ needs and our approach to ensuring we meet them.
We launched Under Construction and our skills maintenance seminars in anticipation of the introduction of Restricted Building Work, which made being a Licensed Building Practitioner (LBP) compulsory for many. Our goal was to help LBPs earn the skills maintenance points required by the scheme – later termed ‘elective’ learning.
For four years, the scheme depended wholly on industry-led activities such as those offered by PlaceMakers – and we remained committed to supporting builders along the way.
That commitment has never changed, but what has is the LBP points system. The introduction of mandatory activities towards the end of 2015 reduced the need for elective points by half.
With those changes well and truly in full swing, we’ve looked at how best we can use our resources to support our builders. As such, we will now host one series of skills maintenance seminars per year – with the next starting in late July – and publish a printed version of Under Construction every two months.
That doesn’t mean we’ll be delivering any less news, views and tips each month. Our website will feature the same number of monthly articles to ensure you don’t miss out on any of the relevant industry information you have come to rely on – we’ll be posting articles as they become available, so make sure to visit the site for the latest updates.
We know that gathering points isn’t the only reason our customers read Under Construction – most are committed to staying up to speed for their own professional development.
Evolving to meet customer demand is a key aspect of good business and we want to ensure that PlaceMakers is in the best position to service your needs. We look forward to continuing to provide high-quality content that adds value to your business.

New regulations (Building (Building Product Information Requirements) Regulations 2022) have been made by the Government to ensure a minimum level of information is provided about designated building products, increasing confidence in their use, and supporting better and more efficient decision making
The new regulations for building products mean that certain information is required to be provided publicly by building product manufacturers and importers. Retailers and distributors will then need to check that the required information is available for the designated building products they sell or distribute.
The regulations will make it easier for designers, builders and homeowners to decide which products are right for the job, use them as intended, and make decisions about alternative products where there are product shortages. They will also help building consent authorities with more efficient consenting, as they will have the right information readily available to check that building products included in plans and specifications meet their applicable Building Code performance requirements.
Manufacturers, importers, retailers, and distributors have 18 months to prepare to meet their obligations, before the regulations apply to designated building products manufactured in, or imported, into New Zealand, on or after, 11 December 2023.
There are two classes of designated building products:
Class 1: batch or mass-produced products that are typically available for retail or wholesale purchase. For example, cladding products, mechanical fixings, insulation products, internal lining, roofing products, structural wood-based products, structural steel and reinforcing products, sanitary plumbing and drainage products, including tapware (this is not an exhaustive list).
Class 2: custom-made lines of products that are made to order to client specifications. For example, external window joinery and doors that have been customised to the specifications of individual clients (for example, specifications on dimensions and glass type).
Information must be published and maintained online that is publicly available. Information requirements to be displayed online include:
The name and a description of the product (or product line from which the product is customised) and its intended use.
A product identifier (in most circumstances).
The legal and trading name of manufacturers and, if applicable, importers.
A statement specifying the relevant clauses of the building code and how the product is expected to contribute to compliance, as well as any limitations on the use of the product.
Any design, installation and maintenance requirements.
Either a statement that the product is not subject to any warnings or bans or a description of warnings or bans applicable to the product.
MBIE has further information available to help manufacturers, importers, retailers, and distributors with their responsibilities.

Prosecution of unlicensed builder fined for posing as LBP ‘first of its kind’ for MBIE
M BIE’s Occupational Licensing Team has successfully prosecuted an unlicensed North Shore builder for misrepresenting himself as a person licensed to carry out or supervise building work or building inspection work, while not being licensed.
Thirty-two-year-old Bin Zhang, also known as Aaron Zhang, was convicted and fined $3,000 in the North Shore District Court for charges brought under the Building Act 2004.
Zhang, who has never been a Licensed Building Practitioner (LBP), undertook a bathroom renovation at a North Shore home and stated he was qualified for the job, completing and signing a Record of Building Work for Restricted Building Work, and provided a fake LBP licence number. The contract with the homeowner was terminated a month later due to concerns about the quality of Zhang’s work.
He was also trading as XR Builds and Renovation Limited, which is not registered as a limited liability company on the Companies Register.
Investigations team leader Simon Thomas says this prosecution is the first of its kind that MBIE has brought against an individual.
“The Building Practitioners Board, which oversees the LBP scheme, can take action against LBPs; however, the investigation of non-LBPs is undertaken by MBIE, as the government’s building regulator,” says Thomas.
“We hope this recent prosecution sends a clear message to builders that they can only sign off on restricted building work if they are an LBP – the same goes for carrying out or supervising restricted building work.
“Where MBIE has evidence of anyone operating outside of the law, they can expect to be caught and prosecuted accordingly.”

The building and construction sector is a significant contributor to carbon emissions.  To meet New Zealand’s climate change goals, a once-in-a-generation change to building laws and requirements is under way
In July, Jenny Salesa, Minister for Building and Construction, launched the Building for Climate Change programme, with the goal of reducing emissions from constructing and operating buildings, and ensuring buildings are prepared for the future effects of climate change.
The programme recognises that a significant amount of New Zealand’s carbon emissions result from the building and construction sector, and if New Zealand is serious about meeting its climate change goals, then changes need to be made in the sector.
As part of the programme, over the next 30 years, MBIE will set targets for energy use and carbon emissions, and incentives will be introduced to encourage people to think innovatively about the construction, design and operation of buildings.
The programme will result in changes to current building laws – both the Building Act and the Building Code. There will be a focus on starting to change people’s behaviour, and the way they think about designing, constructing and operating buildings.
MBIE has outlined how the programme will be made up of three frameworks that will work together to reduce emissions:
the operational efficiency of buildings (using less energy, using less water and improving the air quality and temperature).
the amount of greenhouse gas emissions generated by building materials, construction processes and disposal of materials (known as whole of life embodied carbon).
adaptation, which will link together the work that the sector can do to improve the climate resilience of buildings.
Transforming operational efficiency
This framework will set upper limits for new buildings to obtain a consent under the Building Act 2004. The framework will set levels of efficiency for energy and water use. It will also set defined comfort levels, including temperature ranges and air quality, that will need to be achieved for consent.
These targets will mean that everyone involved in the design, development and construction of a building will need to keep efficiency at the forefront of their thinking. As well as direct benefits, there will be co-benefits, including improved health outcomes and reduced energy bills – both of these are likely to have greater impacts on parts of society that are most in need. This is an area where MBIE will seek significant cooperation and partnership with both the construction sector and other government agencies to ensure these co-benefits are delivered.
Reducing whole of life embodied carbon
This framework will set mandatory reporting requirements and targets that will need to be kept under to gain consent. The framework will consider the allowed level of greenhouse gas emissions from:
the materials used in construction.
the construction process.
disposing of construction waste.
disposal of the building at the end of its life.
These targets are intended provide pressure on the whole supply chain to reduce emissions. They are also intended to be an important driver of change to a culture in which climate change considerations are part of day-to-day business, and to create incentives for designers and engineers to look for lower carbon solutions.
Adaptation – Making New Zealand safer for the future
New Zealand will be facing different challenges to its buildings than were faced 50 or even ten years ago. It is important to ensure that New Zealand’s buildings will last and are able to cope with the climate changes we cannot avoid. Keeping people safe from the likely future effects of climate change means MBIE will be looking at how the sector can make buildings more resilient to adverse events that might become more common and to new events that might begin to appear.
As well as improved protection, MBIE will be considering how to be more efficient in using resources that may become scarcer, such as water. Buildings will also need to remain safe, habitable and at a suitable temperature for periods of time without power in extreme weather events; for example, when utility grid connections may be broken.
MBIE will be working with other government partners on the National Adaptation Plan, a whole of government response on how New Zealand will adapt to climate change risks. The core of the response will be making sure the right buildings are built in the right places. As well as regulatory options, the work will look at what non-regulatory options are likely to help drive more resilience in buildings such as insurance availability, provision of information and incentives.
Making changes in a post covid-19 world
MBIE is mindful that New Zealand’s economy has changed since Covid-19: it is more fragile, and the sector has been affected by job losses as well as reduced revenue and cancellation of future work. MBIE is committed to ensuring the Building for Climate Change Programme understands the new sector and how the changes that are being proposed will affect those within the sector as well as the wider population.
Your views wanted
John Sneyd, General Manager Building System Performance, explained that MBIE will be seeking the views from the sector to ensure its views are understood when designing the programme.
“We plan to develop these initiatives jointly with the sector, to make sure we get it right. Discussions with the industry began in July and most of this year will be focused on talking and listening to the sector about the best way to move forward, and changes will then start to be rolled out next year.”
The public consultation process on these frameworks and targets will allow the sector to provide MBIE feedback on what they think needs to be done, and the impact any proposals would have on the sector.
Sneyd said MBIE encourages anyone who wants further information about this, or who wants to participate in the consultation process, to register on the MBIE website: mbie.govt.nz/building-and-energy/building/building-for-climate-change

Not sure you’re providing the right training for your apprentice? Take a leaf out of Slab Specialists’ book to make your investment work for both parties
With unprecedented levels of building and construction activity generating an abundance of new opportunities for businesses around New Zealand, a key question is how to keep up with demand.
Quentin Stevenson, director of concrete slab and foundations company Slab Specialists, has over 20 years’ experience working in the building and construction industry, and is a firm believer in the importance of training to stay on top of the game.
Slab Specialists employs 60 staff and has offices in Auckland and Christchurch, two of the fastest-growing cities in the country. Looking to further expand the business and cater for the ever-increasing demand for specialist foundations, Quentin currently has 15 BCITO apprentices going through on-site training to become fully fledged carpenters and concrete specialists.
Left to right: Apprentices James Hughes, Livingston Stefano, Callum Longden, Henry Lin, Joeseph Barchard, Paul Peyroux, Scott Findlay, Andrew Cosgriff, Liam King and director Quentin Stevenson
Quentin has created a system of learning that works well for the company and the apprentices, combining onsite, hands-on development with classroom sessions to give his staff the extra edge.
“Every Monday night, we pull all our apprentices into the office for a training session, over and above their work day,” says Quentin. “It’s easy to use apprentices as labourers, but we try to train them well and get it into our guys’ heads that they are training to be professional builders. Pizza turns up at 6 o’clock, so they know if they want to eat as well, they need to be here on time!”
“Training apprentices keeps you on your toes and on top of the latest developments.” – Quentin Stevenson, Slab Specialists director
After the usual three-month trial period, workers get the opportunity to undertake an apprenticeship with BCITO. The combination of Quentin’s rigorous training programme, alongside visits and assessments made onsite by a BCITO training advisor, has created a loyal and highly skilled team.
“They’re getting paid, while being trained on the job. At the end of it, they come out with a recognised qualification that allows them to earn some decent money.”
Slab Specialists also has a dedicated member of staff to support apprentices with their BCITO course, over and above the support they get from BCITO itself.
“This helps create a good environment of professionalism and it helps them to know that they’re actually achieving something,” says Quentin.
Not only has taking on apprentices satisfied Quentin’s labour requirements, it has also had wider ranging benefits for the company and Quentin’s own personal development.
“Training apprentices keeps you on your toes and on top of the latest developments,” says Quentin.
“Some of our more senior guys have huge amounts of experience, but they were trained before computers. What I say to our guys is, if you work 9 to 5 and do no extra training after hours, you’ll stagnate – you just won’t go anywhere.
“The combination of Quentin’s rigorous training programme, alongside visits and assessments made onsite by a BCITO training advisor, has created a loyal and highly skilled team
“The people who make the All Blacks, they aren’t just talented, they work hard to get there and then work even harder to stay there. Business is no different. As a professional builder, you get paid for your labour, just as the All Blacks get paid for playing rugby. However, they put a lot of effort into their training to keep their game sharp and, as a professional builder, you need to do the same.”
Slab Specialists combines onsite, hands-on development with classroom sessions to give its apprentices the extra edge
If you’re a construction employer looking to grow your team and keen to take on an up-and-coming builder, contact BCITO today on 0800 422 486 . They may also be able to find your new apprentice for you through their job matching service.

Building Practitioners Board provides notable decisions against two Carpentry LBPs, who completed work well below standards expected of licence holders
Due to the seriousness of the matters in question, the Building Practitioners Board has decided to name the two LBPS, who were both issued strong penalties.
The first complaint was made against Feroz Ali in Auckland (C2-01401), and the second was made against Ah Sui Ah Sui in Waikato (C2-01450).
While the complaints differ in nature and result, it is important that all LBPs are aware of the pitfalls and avoid similar shortcomings. Read more about the situations below.
Feroz Ali (Decision C2-01401)
Mr Ali was found to have:
Carried out building work in a negligent or incompetent manner.
Failed to comply with a building consent.
Failed to provide a record of work as required by the Building Act 2004 (the Act).
Acted in a manner that brings, or was likely to bring, the LBP scheme into disrepute.
The Board heard evidence that the consented plans and specifications required Mr Ali to install manufactured trusses. Instead, Mr Ali constructed the trusses onsite using second-hand timber. This issue was brought to light when the designer (who was the Complainant) notified the building consent authority. Mr Ali did not return to the site after this, despite having already been paid the full sum for the work. A Special Adviser, appointed by the Board, provided expert comment, saying that “Mr Ali was outside of his expertise as the plans specifically stated that an accredited manufacturer should design and construct the trusses”.
As a result, the affected property had been constructed by Mr Ali in a manner that was not in accordance with the plans, using unspecified materials and techniques. Mr Ali had also displayed poor behaviour and understanding of the contractual and regulatory settings. The Board said the offending was at the higher end of the scale.
The Board also noted that Mr Ali’s licence had previously been cancelled for other matters and so ordering a cancellation was not an option. However, Mr Ali was issued a $5,000 fine, an order for costs and publication of this decision due to the serious nature of the complaint.
Ah Sui Ah Sui (C2-01450)
Mr Ah Sui was found to have:
Carried out building work in a negligent or incompetent manner.
Failed to comply with a building consent.
Failed to provide a Record of Work as required by the Building Act.
In this matter, a Technical Assessor was engaged by the Board to provide an expert view of the building work carried out and supervised by Mr Ah Sui. The Board found that Mr Ah Sui failed to ensure the plans were followed and was not sufficiently familiar with modern building practices. This led to a breakdown in on-site processes and, as a result, joinery, cladding, a pergola and internal plasterboard linings were not installed correctly.
While the Board found that Mr Ah Sui had failed to comply with the building consent, they noted that some aspects of his deviation could have been accepted via a minor variation, and therefore did not hold Mr Ah Sui to account for these.
The Board also noted in its decision that Mr Ah Sui had not followed the consumer protection measures in the Act correctly, due to lack of knowledge. Mr Ah Sui did not provide the homeowner with a disclosure statement or written contract, which has been a legal requirement since January 2015.
The Board cancelled Mr Ah Sui’s licence. The Board also ordered Mr Ah Sui to pay some costs towards the inquiry and the publication of this decision, again, due to the serious nature of the complaint.
What can be learned from these decisions?
Poor onsite quality assurance and a lack of adherence to the consented plans led to both of these LBPs being disciplined. The outcome for both homeowners was less than desirable – the behaviour of these LBPs falls well below the standards expected of licence holders.
Having a solid grasp of regulatory and consenting requirements is vital to good quality and compliant building outcomes. Always ensure that you follow the specifications and instructions within those documents and if you have concerns it is appropriate to question the designer or the building consent authority. You should not undertake work that is outside the scope of the consented plans without obtaining approval and instruction from the local authority, the homeowner and the designer.
Understanding your regulatory and contractual obligations is also key and has been highlighted by these two complaints. Make sure you follow the rules around contracting and be aware that when a dispute arises, there is an appropriate way to approach the situation. If a dispute has arisen around the contract and you are unsure of what to do, seek advice from an authoritative source.
Lastly, make sure you are familiar with Part 4A of the Building Act, which deals with consumer rights and remedies.

Including value engineering options during a project’s design can help manage costs and avoid a budget blowout
Traditionally many see design and quantity surveying as being standalone practices. However, the benefits of combining these practices become obvious when analysing their individual strengths.
A quantity surveyor (QS) can provide valuable input at the start of a project by providing advice about ‘value engineering’ and cost management.
Value engineering
Value engineering involves a QS providing different options to realise cost saving benefits for a project.
Examples of value engineering in a design process include:
Advising on using different cladding types as a cost-saving option.
Design adjustments that mean standard materials can be used rather than specially created materials or materials that create excessive waste.
Ensuring a ceiling height is the same as a standard sheet size for plasterboard.
Designing the project so work is completed in stages, to allow costs to be set out accurately and keep track of specific measurements at each stage.
Design benefits
Often, and despite best efforts, an initial budget provided by a client is blown as excitement about the project grows. To help manage costs, it’s best to bring in a quantity surveyor during several stages of the design process:
For the initial conversation with the designer and the client, to discuss budgets and goals, set expectations and identify the limits of the design within the cost parameters. At this point, it’s important to talk to the client about their budget and what they want to achieve. It can be easier to identify early on if the goals and the budget are likely to work. This is also an opportunity to discuss ideas about value engineering for the designer and the client to think about.
Once the concept plans have been completed, a quantity surveyor can provide an indicative budget. This can be useful prior to the working drawings being completed as it can save rework if the plans exceed the budget. If further value engineering is required, this is a good time for a discussion between the designer and client.
After the concept drawings have been signed off and the working drawings completed, a quantity surveyor can provide a schedule of quantities. A schedule of quantities is used during the tender process and is a list and measurement for all carpentry and concrete items needed for a project. Using a schedule of quantities means that all builders use the same measurements; overall, this makes tenders fairer and easier to compare. It often also encourages builders to tender a price, as the exercise is far less labour intensive without the need to measure as well as price.

New Healthy Home Standards for rental properties in New Zealand became law on 1 July 2019. These set out specific and minimum standards for heating, insulation, ventilation, moisture ingress and drainage, and draught stopping in rental properties
As the deadline for compliance with the standards is fast approaching, when working at a client’s property, you might get asked some questions about the standards and what landlords need to do to make sure their properties comply.
From 1 July 2021, all private rental properties must comply with the standards within 90 days of any new or renewed tenancy.
Responsibility for meeting these standards sits with the landlord of the property and, if they haven’t already, landlords should now be thinking about the work that needs to be completed to ensure their rental properties are compliant with the standards by the deadline.
Tenancy Services’ website has a wealth of easy-to-understand information about the standards, as well as easy-to-use tools that calculate the requirements for individual properties to be compliant with the standards.
The standards can be accessed whether you’re in the office or on site using your mobile phone. Below is a brief overview of some of the standards you may get asked about, and where to point people if they need more information.
Heating standard
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends a minimum indoor temperature of 18˚C. By installing heating that can reach this temperature on the coldest days of the year, tenants will be able to keep warm all year round.
The heating standard means rental properties must comply with the following requirements:
There must be one or more fixed heaters that can directly heat the main living room.
Heater(s) must be fixed (not portable), and must be at least 1.5 kW in heating capacity and meet the minimum heating capacity needed for the main living room.
There is an online heating assessment tool to calculate the requirements for the living room in a rental home. Alternatively, landlords can use the formula outlined in Schedule 2 of the Residential Tenancies (Healthy Homes Standards) Regulations 2019. There is a handy guide to read before getting started with the Tool – landlords will need the measurements of their living room walls, floor, windows, ceiling and any other features to accurately calculate the heating requirements. You can find the tool and guide at tenancy.govt.nz/heating-tool .
The heating guidance document contains information on how to find out what size heater(s) are required, exemptions to the heating standard and further details. This guidance can be found at tenancy.govt.nz/heating-standard .
Insulation standard
The healthy homes insulation standard builds on the current regulations, meaning some existing insulation will need to be topped up or replaced. All existing insulation must still be in reasonable condition to meet the requirements. This means there should be no mould, dampness, damage or gaps. All insulation must be installed in accordance with NZS 4246:2016 Energy efficiency – installing bulk thermal insulation in residential buildings .
The online insulation tool will help landlords find out whether they need to upgrade the insulation in their rental property to meet the standards. You can search for the tool at tenancy.govt.nz.
The insulation guidance document, which contains more specific information on the insulation standard, can be found at tenancy.govt.nz/healthy-homes/insulation-standard .
Ventilation standard
Mould and dampness caused by poor ventilation is harmful for tenants’ health as well as a landlord’s property. The ventilation standard targets mould and dampness in rental homes.
Rental homes must have openable windows or doors in the livingroom, dining room, kitchen and bedrooms. Kitchens and bathrooms must have extractor fans that vent to the outside.
After 1 July 2019, newly installed extractor fans must have a minimum diameter and exhaust capacity. These differ for kitchens and bathrooms:
In kitchens, extractor fans must have a minimum diameter of 150mm or an exhaust capacity of at least 50 litres per second.
In bathrooms, extractor fans must have a minimum diameter of 120mm or an exhaust capacity of at least 25 litres per second.
The online ventilation tool is available for landlords to figure out if they need to install new extractor fans in the kitchens and bathrooms of their rental properties. You can search for the tool at tenancy.govt.nz.
The ventilation guidance document, which contains more specific information on the ventilation standard, can be found at tenancy.govt.nz/healthy-homes/ventilation-standard .
Moisture ingress and drainage standard
Moisture in a home can lead to poor health outcomes for tenants and can be destructive to the quality of a house.
Rental properties must have efficient drainage for the removal of storm water, surface water and ground water. Rental properties with an enclosed sub-floor space must have a ground moisture barrier.
Ground moisture barriers must either:
Be a polythene sheet and installed in accordance with section 8 of NZS4246:2016 , or
Have a vapour flow resistance of at least 50MNs/g and be installed by a professional installer.
The moisture ingress and drainage standard document, which has more specific information on the moisture ingress and drainage standard, can be found at tenancy.govt.nz/healthy-homes/moisture-and-drainage-standard.
Draught stopping standard
Draughts increase the likelihood of lower temperatures in houses and can make it more expensive for a tenant to heat their home. Fixing draughts is an easy way to reduce heating bills and keep rental homes warm and dry.
Landlords must make sure the property doesn’t have unreasonable gaps or holes in walls, ceilings, windows, skylights, floors and doors which cause noticeable draughts. All unused open fireplaces must be closed off or their chimneys must be blocked to prevent draughts.
The draught stopping guidance document, which has more specific information on the draught stopping standard, can be found at tenancy.govt.nz/healthy-homes/draught.
Exemptions to the healthy homes standards
In some situations, a property may be exempt from complying with the healthy homes standards or parts of the standards. More information on exemptions is available at can be found at tenancy.govt.nz/healthy-homes/exemptions-to-the-healthy-homes-standards
This article is an excerpt from Codewords Issue 98. Reading Codewords articles that are relevant to your licence class is a mandatory requirement for Licensed Building Practitioners. These questions can be answered through the LBP portal, online at underconstruction.placemakers.co.nz or recorded on the magazine, then provided at the time of renewal.

The Government has announced sweeping reforms to New Zealand’s building consent system, promising faster approvals, clearer liability rules and more consistent standards across the country.
Building and Construction Minister Chris Penk said the changes would streamline a system long criticised by builders, designers and councils for adding unnecessary costs and delays.
“This is the most significant reform of the consent system in decades,” Penk said. “It will bring down costs, reduce duplication and support more affordable housing and greater productivity in the construction sector.”
Scrapping joint and several liability
The headline change is a shift from joint and several liability to a proportionate model. Currently, councils can be forced to shoulder the majority of costs when building failures occur, even if they were only partly responsible.
The Oaks Shores case in Queenstown, where ratepayers faced the risk of decades of higher rates to cover remediation, was cited by Penk as a prime example.
“In 2015, the Oaks Shores body corporate filed a $160m claim for weathertight defects. The developer had been placed into voluntary liquidation and was not sued, leaving ratepayers exposed to the entire claim.
“If the case hadn’t been settled privately, ratepayers could have faced increases of $300 a year for 30 years. It’s time to put the responsibility where it belongs.”
Penk said the new rules would ensure each party is accountable only for their share of work. Options being considered include requiring builders, designers and developers to carry professional indemnity insurance or provide home warranties as an added safeguard.
One system, less duplication
With 66 Building Consent Authorities (BCAs) across New Zealand, inconsistencies in interpretation of the Building Code remain a major source of frustration. Penk said builders working across multiple council areas often face different requirements for the same design, resulting in higher costs and repeated paperwork.
“The second major change I am announcing will allow councils to voluntarily consolidate their BCA functions with each other,” he said.
“It is ridiculous builders, designers and homeowners must navigate 66 different interpretations of the Building Code. Builders can be rejected on paperwork that would be accepted by a neighbouring authority simply because each BCA applies the rules differently.
“Many councils have asked for this and I expect they will seize the opportunity to consolidate, share resources like building inspectors and IT systems, and pass the savings on to ratepayers.”
Industry reaction
Details of the liability settings and measures to enable voluntary BCA consolidation will be confirmed through amendments to the Building Act 2004, with the Government expecting to introduce a bill to Parliament in early 2026.
Regulatory changes will include removing the requirement for a Territorial Authority (TA) to be a BCA, if they transfer their building control functions to another accredited BCA; removing restrictions on TAs transferring consent functions to a non-TA organisation; and updating regulations to eliminate duplication and incentivise collaboration.
Building Industry Federation Chief Executive Julien Leys welcomed the announcement.
“Anything where we can address costs and delays is welcome,” Leys told RNZ . “So, I say, bring it on.”
Master Builders Chief Executive Ankit Sharma also welcomed the “practical solutions” put forward by Penk and said they could result in productivity gains for the industry.
“The proposal to consolidate building consent authorities has the potential to reduce compliance costs, improve consistency across regions and speed up approvals. These are practical solutions that, if implemented well, could drive meaningful productivity gains for the sector.”
He added that adjusting BCA liability settings could create a “fairer and more balanced” system – but warned it needs to be paired with “strong consumer protections”.
Process building consents at pace
Local Government New Zealand (LGNZ) President Sam Broughton was enthusiastic in his support, saying LGNZ had lobbied for these changes since 2019.
“Under the current system, councils are often left ‘holding the bag’ if something goes wrong with the finished building. This means ratepayers bear a disproportionate and unfair amount of risk and cost, and this has driven an overly cautious approach to consenting.
“We strongly believe it will have an instant and positive impact on housing growth; councils will be in a better position to consent more efficiently, with less legal risk borne by local government — and therefore less risk for ratepayers.”
Broughton also welcomed the proposed changes to the BCA system, saying they would allow councils to share resources and reduce costs.
“We know that councils play a vital role in housing growth, despite an imperfect system that has often put unnecessary burdens on local government. The changes signalled by government today will effectively ‘unshackle’ councils and allow them to process building consents at pace.”

To maintain durability and performance over time, plaster cladding solutions require movement control joints
Figure 2 – click to expand
Working on a plaster-based cladding system is Restricted Building Work (RBW), unless you are doing repairs, replacement or maintenance work under Schedule 1. All RBW requires a building consent and, if you are doing the work, you either need to hold an external plastering licence or be supervised by someone who does.
Reduce risk of cracking
Cracking in external plastered claddings such as stucco and textured finishes is a potential source of water entry into the building structure. The cracking may be caused by movement from changes in temperature, moisture level or curing shrinkage, or from building movement due to wind or earthquakes.
Movement control joints, which allow movement to reduce the risk of cracking occurring, must be incorporated in plaster finishes. They manage cracking by providing predetermined lines of weakness or a flexible sealed joint in the plastered finish.
Locate joints during design
The locations of movement control joints should be determined at the design stage of the building project and should be based on the type of plastered or textured finish to be applied, as well as the overall ‘look’ of the building.
Movement control joint locations must be shown on drawings and should not be left up to the on-site plasterer. There is a range of options for vertical joints. Horizontal joints should be flashed or have a cladding overlap.
Figure 3 – click to expand
Movement control joints in textured finishes
Textured plaster finishes include modified cement and acrylic plaster, and can be applied over a range of substrates. These include fibre-cement sheets, polystyrene, exterior insulation and finish system (EIFS) cladding and polystyrene block systems, clay bricks, concrete masonry and concrete.
Locating the joints in textured finishes
The locations of movement control joints in the plaster finish vary according to the substrate type. The locations should align with any movement control joints in the substrate and occur where the substrate support changes, eg from solid to timber-framed construction. Locations for movement control joints are typically required:
Vertically in accordance with the supplier’s instructions, typically up to 5.4m for fibre-cement and up to 20m for EIFS.
Aligned with structural control joints.
At each floor level for horizontal joints.
Vertically on either side of large window and door openings.
At junctions between different materials. Figure 4 – click to expand

Forming joints in textured finishes
Vertical control joints are formed in fibre-cement and polystyrene substrates by filling the gaps between the substrate sheets with sealant. This is either over a bond-breaker tape between fibre-cement sheets (Figure 1 – see main image) or over a polyethylene foam (PEF) backing rod between polystyrene sheets (Figure 2).
Alternatively, a proprietary unplasticised polyvinyl chloride (uPVC) expansion joint may be inserted between polystyrene sheets. The finish coat is then applied over the sealant or the expansion joint.
The sealant must be correctly installed to ensure that a waterproof joint is achieved. The sealant must:
Figure 5 – click to expand
Stick to both sides of the joint.
Have a cross section that is thinner in the middle of the joint than at the edges.
Not adhere to the substrate material.
The joint ratio should be 2:1, eg for a 10mm wide joint, the sealant should be 5mm deep at the centre of the joint.
Vertical control joints are typically between 6-18mm wide depending on the substrate and the manufacturer’s recommendations.
Inter-storey horizontal movement control joints are typically flashed with a metal flashing (Figure 3) and should have a minimum 15mm wide gap.
Movement control joints in stucco
Movement control joint requirements for reinforced stucco over a drained and vented cavity with a rigid or non-rigid backing are set out in NZS 4251.1: 2007 Solid plastering – Cement plasters for walls, ceilings and soffits .
Locating control joints in stucco
Figure 6 – click to expand
NZS 4251.1: 2007 requires control joints to be located:
For vertical joints:
– on both sides of openings that are 2m wide or more (Figure 4)
– on one side of openings that are less than 2m wide*
At each floor level (horizontal joints).
To break up expanses of wall more than 12m2 (4m maximum spacings vertically and horizontally is recommended).
At changes in a wall cross section such as external and internal corners.
At any point where natural flexing of the building may occur, such as at the top of a plate level of a gable wall, or where there is a cantilevered deck.
*Note: A vertical control joint is not required when an opening is less than 500mm wide, or the area of the opening is less than 0.2m2. Where the width of an opening is between 500mm and 2m but the opening is more than 0.2m2, diagonal reinforcing is required at the corners opposite the movement control joint.
Forming control joints in stucco
Vertical control joints are formed by plastering up to a corrosion-resistant angle, T-section, proprietary jointing bead or temporary batten (Figure 5). Alternatively, for three-coat systems, a V-groove may be cut through the lower (bond and flanking) plaster coats before they harden.
Fill the gap or groove that is created with a polyurethane, polysulphide or neutral cure silicon-type sealant inserted over a PEF backing rod before the finish plaster coat is applied. Prime the joint edges before applying sealant because sealant will not stick to the plaster.
The joints should be 10-12 mm wide and wire mesh or lath reinforcing must not be carried across the control joints.
Horizontal movement control joints are typically flashed (Figure 6) and should have a minimum 15mm wide gap.

Repeated vibrations from power and hand tools can cause Hand Arm Vibration Syndrome (HAVS), a dangerous condition that can be permanently disabling
When Jason Johnstone was medically discharged from his job as an operator/trainer after being diagnosed with HAVS, he decided to explore ways to prevent it happening to other New Zealanders.
Jason is one of the few people in New Zealand diagnosed with HAVS, a condition where nerves and blood vessels are damaged by exposure to repeated vibrations from hand and power tools. It can be permanently disabling. Symptoms include tingling fingers, numbness, pain, weakness, loss of dexterity and impeded blood flow.
If caught early enough, HAVS can be reversible – but, in Jason’s case, his symptoms persist, flaring up at the slightest change in temperature or during certain activities.
“All the crockery in our house has chips on it because, when I do the dishes, my fingers often go numb and I tend to drop them. It’s much worse in winter and I’m pretty much stuffed when it comes to doing up buttons.”
Bad vibrations
Jaso n has worked with power tools for most of his life. His HAVS symptoms became more pronounced while he was working at the Tiwai Point aluminium smelter as an operator/trainer — a job that involved use of tools such as jack hammers. The smelter did have time limits on use of certain tools, but it turns out intensity was also a factor.
“My wife is a UK-trained general surgical registrar and diagnosed me with HAVS, though I had no idea what HAVS was at that time. I told the smelter doctor my hands felt funny and was sent to see occupational health specialist Professor David McBride, a leading workplace disease expert in New Zealand, who formally diagnosed me.
“Basically, I was told l couldn’t use the tools anymore and was medically discharged from my job at Tiwai. But, what I noticed was that no one had any idea how the injury had occurred. Sure, vibration emitted from tools and machinery had caused my injury but there was no data to explain this to the medical or health and safety professional. No one knew how much vibration I had been exposed to on a daily basis, nothing. It was all guesswork and seemed completely crazy, felt like I had wasted 20 years of my life.”
Potential misdiagnosis
Jason’s experience led him to research current figures on HAVS in New Zealand, revealing what he sees as a major issue of underdiagnosis and misdiagnosis.
“According to ACC data on HAVS, there were only 40-50 cases of HAVS in New Zealand from 2000-2018,” says Jason. “This seems unusual, because 6,230 cases were reported in the UK in half of that time. Assuming the workforces are similar, based on population statistics, New Zealand should have witnessed 785 cases in 14 years, or around 44 cases per year.”
He also found that, between 1 July 2009 and 30 June 2019, ACC data showed there were 5,342 cases of carpal tunnel syndrome compared to the United Kingdom’s 2,930. Furthermore, international research has shown that vibration from hand tools does contribute to carpal tunnel injuries.
“In the UK, doctors are trained to recognise HAVS. In New Zealand, they’re not. So, it’s very often misdiagnosed as carpal tunnel and that certainly has been my experience. I believe it’s a problem in New Zealand given workers’ exposure in our construction, forestry, manufacture, transport and agriculture sectors.”
Jason identified the need for a user-based device to monitor vibration and capture much-needed data. He worked with software developer Digital Stock in Invercargill to develop a HAVS monitoring app and dashboard – and sought a real workplace in which to trial it.
Good fit
The ‘real’ workplace Jason found was Delta, a Dunedin-based infrastructure maintenance company that services electricity distribution and communications networks as well as maintaining the local authority’s green spaces. Delta had recently identified HAVS as a workplace hazard for its employees who often use vibrating machinery such as mowers and weed eaters for long periods.
As a result, Delta Health and Safety Manager Matt Sadgrove was immediately keen to help him trial the device.
“I could see this was a smart idea, an innovative New Zealand-made tool to gather information to help us to make smarter decisions to keep our people safe.”
Matt is also a member of the New Zealand Community of Safety Innovation (COSI), a group of around 60 safety professionals who work together to identify new ways to improve health and safety. The group is supported by WorkSafe New Zealand, the New Zealand Institute of Safety Management, the Business Leaders’ Health and Safety Forum and the Health & Safety Association New Zealand (HASANZ).
“Our people are our biggest asset,” says Delta’s Matt. “Vibration is a major workplace health risk in New Zealand and the opportunity to accurately identify, manage and prevent this risk across our workplaces is fantastic.”
Over the next year, Delta’s health and safety team and crews trialled the device, the results of which led Delta to purchase new robotic mowers for the business, eliminating the vibration hazard and removing workers from other hazards such as wasps, working on slopes and sun exposure.
For Jason, the trial has resulted in working prototype vibration detection bands that monitor hand-arm vibration levels.
A knowledge gap filled?
Professor David McBride is an Associate Professor in Occupational and Environmental Medicine at Otago University and says the device is a step in the right direction for New Zealand.
“As a workplace hazard, exposure to vibration is ubiquitous in New Zealand across construction, agriculture, horticulture and forestry. New Zealand needs to invest in more research in this area.
“With this device, we have for the first time a simple tool using available technology to scientifically assess risk in the workplace, helping raise awareness of the issue, support training and education and importantly ensure people take adequate breaks.”
Daniel Hummerdal, Head of Innovation at WorkSafe New Zealand which supports the COSI, says Jason’s device and Delta’s trial are a great example of the ingenuity and motivation in New Zealand to create better outcomes.
“This journey underscores the purpose of COSI, which is to connect people and organisations that are developing and trialling their ideas in isolation and bring them together. We can all be inspired and learn from each other and not only spread good ideas quicker but help translate them into actions that create better outcomes.”

Montage Kitchens & Joinery managing director Ken Monk
Taking on an apprentice allows you to develop their skills according to your own standards – it’s an investment in growing your business and the industry as a whole. Ken Monk, managing director of Hamilton’s Montage Kitchens and Joinery, explains why he hires apprentices
Ken Monk’s company employs 19 staff and has trained more than 20 apprentices since opening its doors in 1980. Ken says training apprentices is a great way to add to a business’ bottom line.
“You end up with highly skilled, valuable tradespeople, who understand how your business operates. That helps the bottom line, because it improves your ability to create high-quality products,” he says. “We always try to have two on the go: one at the start of their training and one nearly qualified.”
Ken says the other reason he trains apprentices is that it builds a stable workforce within the business and industry.
“We’ve got a lot of apprentices who have served their time with us and stayed on after completing their qualifications,” he says. “That helps with staff retention, by building a strong team culture. I haven’t had anyone leave in five years.”
He believes it is important that employers build a relationship with their apprentices and make sure they’re well looked after.
“When I was an apprentice, I was taken care of by my employer. They paid for the costs and it was a great way to train. For me, training is about putting something back into the industry and giving someone the opportunities that I had.”
“You end up with highly skilled, valuable tradespeople, who understand how your business operates. That helps the bottom line, by improving your ability to create high-quality products
Training motivates employees to achieve, because they feel more invested in the work they’re doing. It’s great for your business, because it encourages your staff to stick around and creates a positive organisational culture.
A consistent level of artisanship is important to your clients and your business, so you need to have confidence in your workers’ skills. When you have oversight into the training of your workers, you can understand their strengths and areas for development, and teach them according to the standards of your business.
You were an apprentice once; someone gave you an opportunity to gain the skills of your trade. To make sure the industry has enough qualified professionals to be sustainable, we need skilled and willing employers to help shape the next generation.
Training others will keep you on your toes. It’s a good way to keep abreast of the latest industry developments, meet others in the industry, and learn some new skills yourself.
If you’re an employer interested in taking on a new apprentice, contact BCITO on 0800 4BCITO (422 486). The business development team may be able to help you find a career seeker who fits your profile.
Employees are more motivated when training, because they’re more invested in their work.
You get to instill good work habits in them early on, ensuring a consistent level of craftsmanship.
You’re ensuring the industry’s future by training tomorrow’s workforce.
It’s an opportunity to give someone else the same opportunity you were given.
Training apprentices can help improve staff morale and retention.

New regulations come into force on 1 January, 2015 – make sure you understand your responsibilities beforehand
With consumer protection measures included in the Building Amendment Act 2013 coming into force on 1 January, it’s important to get up to speed now.
The changes will require building contractors to have written contracts, provide information on their relevant skills, experience and qualifications, and disclose their insurance and warranty cover for residential building work valued at more than $30,000.
The strengthened consumer protection measures were set out in the amendments to the Building Act 2004, passed on 28 November 2013, and are described in brief in the cabinet paper, available at mbie.govt.nz.
While the new regulations are technically aimed at protecting consumers, MBIE says the new measures will also help protect builders, particularly those who haven’t been using written contracts. Most disputes come back to what’s written in the contract and, without one, it will be based on minimum clauses outlined in the yet-to-be published guidance.
MBIE hopes to publish guidance on the new regulations in early December.
The new consumer protection measures include:*
1) Mandatory written contracts for residential building work over $30,000. If you’re part of the Certified Builders Association of New Zealand, or a Registered Master Builder, you will have a contract at your disposal. If not, MBIE and Standards NZ are promoting using NZS 3902:2004 as the default building contract for those looking to comply with the new requirements.
2) A requirement for building contractors to provide a checklist and disclose certain information for residential building work over $30,000 before the home owner signs a contract (or when the client has requested this information or checklist).  This checklist – which cannot be amended – will be available on the MBIE website.
Information about the business the consumer is contracting with to carry out the building work.
Information about the key contact person (eg project manager or site foreman) who, as far as the building contractor is aware, will be involved in carrying out or supervising the building work. This person must be available to the client to discuss any aspect of the building project. The building contractor may change the person before or after a contract is signed, provided the building contractor notifies the client if this happens.
Information about insurance policies the building contractor has, or intends to have, in relation to the building work.
Information about any guarantees or warranties the building contractor offers in relation to the building work.
The checklist, which provides standard information to assist consumers with engaging a building contractor.
3) Details of the minimum content that must be included in residential building contracts.
4) Details of the clauses that are taken to be included in a residential building contract that does not contain all of the minimum content, or in a contract for work over $30,000 that is not in writing. This includes which party will be responsible for obtaining building consents, how variations to the building work covered by the contract will be agreed, the payment process and more.
5) Details of the information that a building contractor must provide to the client after the building work is completed, including:
A copy of any current policy of insurance the building contractor holds in relation to the building work done under the residential building contract. This does not include policies that expire on completion of the building work.
A copy of any guarantees or warranties that apply to materials or services that comprise the building work, including information about how to make a claim under the guarantee or warranty, whether the guarantee or warranty is transferrable and whether it needs to be signed and returned to the issuer in order to be valid.
Information about the processes and materials to be used to maintain any element of the building work where maintenance is required to meet the durability requirements of the Building Code or will affect the validity of any applicable guarantee or warranty.
6) Infringement fees of $500 for breaching the contract, disclosure or checklist requirements, as well as new powers enabling MBIE to prosecute people for providing false or misleading disclosure information.
7) A new 12-month ‘defect repair period’ will also kick-in, placing the responsibility on the building contractor to remedy any defects they have been told about. If the contractor disagrees, the burden of proof is on he/she to demonstrate their work is not defective.  This repair period will not apply to work carried out before 1 January 2015 or a building contract signed before 1 January 2015.
MBIE is currently working with the industry to develop guidance to assist both consumers and building practitioners in understanding what should be considered a ‘defect’. It will provide examples of what is and what isn’t a defect, and should be available in December.
*For more information on these new legislative requirements and more detail on the information requirements for building contractors (see the Cabinet paper) the MBIE website
NOTE: Although the Cabinet paper proposes $20,000 as the minimum price of residential building work requiring contracts, checklists and disclosure of information, Cabinet decided to increase this price to $30,000.

More than 75% of carpenters entering the LBP scheme are fully qualified
Over the past few months, LBP registrar Paul Hobbs has attended numerous sector-related events, trade gatherings and conferences, including a PlaceMakers seminar in Petone, Wellington. This has given him the opportunity to discuss builder’s concerns and answer questions about where the scheme is heading.
At CBANZ’s recent conference, he was asked when the scheme would move to a fully-fledged qualification-based one as opposed to operating under the current mix of experience and/or qualification entry requirement.
Paul says that, while no firm date has been set for this to occur, requiring those entering the scheme to be fully qualified is on the work programme, as it would align with other occupational licensing schemes in the building sector. However, for the past two years, more than 75% of carpenters entering the LBP scheme in the last two years are fully qualified.
“It is worth noting that the LBP scheme is a complex model, in so far as it has seven separate licence classes: six that are trade-related, and one which deals with the design of certain building types,” says Paul. “More carpenters by far enter the scheme via a recognised qualification than any other licence class with a recognised trade qualification.
“Moving forward, the challenge for MBIE and the sector is to lift the current levels of qualified entrants and work towards drawing a legislative ‘line in the sand’, when it will become an explicit requirement to hold a trade or design-related qualification in order to enter the scheme. This is undoubtedly an important step in the scheme’s future development and maturity.”
At the PlaceMakers seminar, Paul also sought to dispel beliefs that getting licensed was too simple.
“Contrary to some feedback we’ve received, not everyone who applies gets a licence – in 2014, we received 2,108 applications and 275 were not approved,” says Paul. “We also have a complaints process designed to weed out those who have become licensed but perhaps shouldn’t have. We are seeing some significant decisions being handed down by the Building Practitioner’s Board, and complaints are up 40% this year.”

The Building (Building Product Information Requirements) Regulations 2022 commence on 11 December 2023 and set out mandatory information that must be disclosed about designated building products. This will increase confidence in the way building products are used and support decision making
Even though Licensed Building Practitioners (LBPs) will not have any new responsibilities under the new regulations, it’s important that you understand the principles and the benefits you can expect to see from improved and more consistent building product information.
At present, technical product information about building products can be poorly compiled and not address important issues, such as how a product should be used, installed and maintained.
The regulations will require a minimum level of information about building products to be made freely and publicly available. This will help designers, builders and consumers to choose the right products for the right building work and install them in the correct way.
It will also help building consent authorities with more efficient consenting, as they will have the right information readily available to check that products in plans and specifications meet their applicable Building Code performance requirements.
Aotearoa New Zealand-based manufacturers and importers will need to make particular information about the building products they supply to the Aotearoa New Zealand market publicly available, and they must be able to provide evidence for any claims they make about their products. Aotearoa New Zealand-based distributors and retailers will need to check that the product information for designated products they supply complies with the new minimum information requirements and that the information is available to their customers.
Verify products
You should confirm that all building products used meet the minimum product information requirements and that you are installing products according to instructions given in the product information. This is particularly important when dealing with products you might not be familiar with. Information about the product must be available online with a link to the relevant website provided on or with each product.
If you find deficiencies in the product information, then we encourage you to raise your concerns with the relevant product manufacturer or importer. If your concerns are not resolved, please notify the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE). This information is important to help MBIE assess the impact of the legislative reforms, as well as ensure enforcement action can be taken where appropriate.
You can contact MBIE at products@mbie.govt.nz
You should expect to see a reduction in the need to replace or remedy products that fail, in the event that installation is carried out according to the installation instructions provided. You may also see a reduction in labour costs relating to fixing or reinstalling products that were not installed correctly in the first instance.
Better product information is expected to result in fewer building defects, less building rework, more efficient consenting, and safer and more durable buildings.
Key details
The regulations provide for two classes of products and the specific information requirements for each class.
A list of the specific information that must be provided is contained in Schedule 1 and Schedule 2 of the regulations.
The regulations only apply to building products that, when used in building work, may affect whether the building work complies with the Building Code.
Information must be published and maintained by manufacturers and suppliers on an internet site that is publicly available.
The regulations only apply to designated building products that are manufactured in or imported into Aotearoa New Zealand on or after 11 December 2023. The regulations will not be applied retrospectively.
The regulations only apply to new products.
A person cannot supply, in trade, a designated building product in New Zealand that does not have product information that meets regulatory requirements.
Each manufacturer or importer of a product must ensure that the required product information is kept up to date on the relevant internet site from which the information is available to members of the public.
MBIE’s chief executive has powers under the Building Act to enforce the duties and obligations in the regulations. MBIE will monitor the market, investigate complaints and take enforcement action where deemed necessary.
You can read more information about the building product information requirements in the guidance document.

As promised, Under Construction will be including all compulsory Codewords articles to help LBPs earn their required points and stay up to speed with changes. This month’s article is required for all LBP licence holders – and focuses on another compulsory aspect of the scheme
U nder the new skills maintenance scheme, reading Codewords articles relevant to your licence and answering the corresponding questions is a mandatory part of skills maintenance (for those who have renewed their licence since 2 November 2015).
Once you’ve read the article, answer the questions below or online at underconstruction.placemakers.co.nz.
Two in one
As more LBPs transition into the new skills maintenance system, LBP Registrar Paul Hobbs and his team are receiving increasing queries about the on-the-job learning component of the LBP scheme.
In response, they’ve put together two compulsory parts of the LBP scheme – a Codewords article and questions about on-the-job learning.
Why include on-the-job learning?
On-the-job learning was introduced as a simple method of recording naturally occurring learning that has taken place during everyday work onsite or in the design office. Many LBPs are practical people and learn by doing, rather than by sitting in a classroom.
The LBP licence class competencies have been written to reflect this, requiring action and the application of a skill in order to demonstrate understanding. For example, requiring LBPs to construct, install, fabricate, prepare, fix, set out or erect by way of ‘performance indicators’.
Where do I start?
The following table provides some useful pointers and questions to help recognise and harness on-the-job-learnings.
How do I keep track of my learning?
On-the-job-learning is not about creating more administrative work, rather it is about harvesting learning opportunities that arise during everyday work.
Here are some handy ways of keeping track of what you’ve learned:
Go to www.lbp.govt.nz and either:
Download, complete and submit the Record of Learning form.
Submit your learning activity through the LBP portal.
Provide a relevant Record of Work or Certificate of Design as evidence.
Take a photo (this is an easy way to create a record to file later).

It pays to know how each of the three types of LBP suspensions work. MBIE provides guidance below
There are several types of licensed building practitioner (LBP) licensing suspensions – voluntary, relicensing, or disciplinary.  Voluntary suspensions are by choice, but relicensing or disciplinary suspensions happen as a result of your actions as an LBP.
All suspensions appear on your public register page, with the reason for the suspension described, including for disciplinary or relicensing reasons. Clients might steer away from you if you have a disciplinary or relicensing suspension history, so maintaining your current licence status can be very important to your reputation and future business.
Voluntary suspension You may choose to have your licence (or a class of licence) suspended for up to two years by completing the ‘Voluntary suspension of licence form’. You can end your voluntary suspension at any time by completing the ‘Ending voluntary suspension of licence form’. You need to continue to maintain your skills while on a voluntary suspension.
These two forms can be found on the LBP website: lbp.govt.nz/for-lbps/your-licence/suspend-or-cancel-your-licence
Voluntary suspensions are shown on the public register, but are described as ‘at the request of the practitioner’, to separate them from suspensions placed on your licence by the Registrar or Building Practitioners Board.
Relicensing suspension Every year, the Registrar will make contact with you about a month prior to your licence ID card expiring to ensure that you wish to remain licensed.
You can renew your licence online, or contact the LBP licensing team. Your licence will be suspended if you do not respond, if you do not pay your yearly licensing fee or do not complete your skills maintenance (required every two years).
It is important to make contact with the LBP team and renew your licence (which can be done online) because, if your licence is suspended, you will be considered ‘non-licensed’. When you are ‘non-licensed’ you are not able to carry out Restricted Building Work (RBW) unless you’re supervised by an LBP, and you can’t supervise RBW. You also can’t tell people that you are an LBP.
Your suspension is required by law to be shown on the public register for three years. You cannot have your suspension history removed. A suspension can impact on your ability to get jobs as consumers check the public register regularly.
Disciplinary suspension The Building Practitioners Board can suspend an LBP’s licence if an LBP commits a disciplinary offence under section 317 of the Building Act 2004.
A disciplinary suspension means you are ‘non-licensed’ and not able to carry out RBW unless you are supervised by an LBP.  If your license is suspended by the board you can’t supervise RBW and you can’t tell people you are an LBP. Your suspension will also be shown on the public register for three years and may impact on your ability to get work.
This article is an excerpt from Codewords Issue 99. Reading Codewords articles that are relevant to your licence class is a mandatory requirement for Licensed Building Practitioners. These questions can be answered through the LBP portal, online at underconstruction.placemakers.co.nz or recorded on the magazine, then provided at the time of renewal.

Builders across the country value ‘takeaways’ from PlaceMakers eighth round of skills maintenance seminars
PlaceMakers eighth round of seminars was one of the best-attended so far, with many builders looking to better understand the latest changes.
“I always come along to the PlaceMakers’ seminars, but this time round I was dead keen,” says builder Tim Growcott, who attended one of two in the Wellington region. “We’ve got used to dealing with change over the past few years, but at the moment we’re on overload.
“Attending these sessions is a really helpful way to stay up to speed!”
The two-hour seminars flagged the big changes coming through in the Health & Safety and Construction Contracts Act, as well as going into detail about the new consumer protection measures in the Building Act.
Together, presenter John Tait and attendees went over the prescribed checklist and disclosure statement, handed out to everyone upon arrival. John ran through the information which must be included in mandatory written contracts and the new requirement to hand over insurance, warranty and maintenance information at the end of the job regardless of contract value.
There was plenty of discussion about the level of detail required and the purpose of the documents; however, only a handful of the 200-odd builders who attended the Wellington seminar mid-May had started a job under the new provisions.
Local builder Dave Mardell says that, while it may seem that some builders are behind the eight ball on the changes, they came in without any lead time and most homeowners he’d spoken with were completely unaware.
“Many of them have no idea why they’re receiving so much information, let alone understand the new level of work and responsibility we’ve taken on,” says Dave. “Most of them have only just come round to understanding that scaffolding costs need to be included in the price.”
As presenter John Tait went through the content, he also offered practical advice in a number of areas. Some of his key recommendations were to:
Ask questions & push back: particularly when working with architects, designers or engineers; if something doesn’t seem quite right or hasn’t got the level of detail you need, ask the question and put it back on the professional to sort it out. Builders have skill and judgement, so don’t be afraid to speak up if you need to.
Insist on contracts with subtrades: under the new consumer protection measures, the building contractor is liable to fix defects even if the issue relates to work done by their subcontractors, so it’s in your best interests to have subcontracts which pass on the obligation to put it right. This is NOT mandatory, it’s just smart.
Those who attended the Petone session in Wellington started it off with a 15-minute presentation from special guest speaker, LBP registrar Paul Hobbs, who also stayed for the rest of PlaceMakers presentation and questions at the end.
“It was great to have Paul come along and speak to the builders directly about the scheme and where it’s heading,” says John. “He also stuck around afterwards to chat to several builders.”
Paul started his talk by substantiating the protection written contracts offer trades as well as consumers , using the example of a builder, who “locked in” a job with a text “200K?” which elicited the response “yeah” from the homeowner via text.
“As much as we’d like to believe that will be fine, a large number of complaints about LBPs have been triggered by disputes where the agreement between parties has been vague and misunderstandings have arisen,” says Paul, who says it was the same when he worked as a carpenter.
“It was great to be part of a skills maintenance session that was both informative and offered meaningful learning outcomes for those attending,” says Paul
Paul also discussed the upcoming changes to the LBP skills maintenance regime, and suggested some scenarios where the new requirement to record two instances of on-the-job learning could be obtained.
“Basically, anytime you use a new technique, or complete work you haven’t previously done, that’s on-the-job learning,” says Paul. “Another great example is if you fail an inspection, and need to put it right. That’s definitely learning.”
Paul also emphasised the continued importance of skills maintenance activities, such as attending seminars and reading Under Construction .
“It was great to be part of PlaceMakers session because it was both informative and offered meaningful learning outcomes for those attending,” says Paul.

In an industry that’s committed to building ever more safe, healthy and durable buildings, it’s inevitable that the techniques, products and regulations surrounding it continue to evolve. To support its customers in navigating these changes, PlaceMakers continues to offer opportunities for upskilling
This winter, PlaceMakers is once again providing builders with the opportunity to get up to speed with industry changes – and earn skills maintenance points – by attending its next round of seminars.
“Ensuring that our customers can earn all of their elective skills maintenance points through PlaceMakers initiatives is a key focus for us,” says Gary Woodhouse, General Manager Operations and Marketing. “We want to support our builders’ professional development and, in turn, the industry’s professionalism and competency as a whole.”
Getting technical
PlaceMakers has teamed up with three suppliers – SIKA, James Hardie and Thermakraft – to provide “from the horses’ mouth” expertise on best practice installation and new product innovations.
The business side of things
In this day and age, being good on the tools is only half the job for a business owner. Project and paper management, insurance and business nous are important factors in reaching your success goals. NextMinute, BuiltIn Insurance and The Trades Coach will provide insights and resources to help you manage these areas of your business more effectively.
Regulatory updates
The seminars will also include reminders about recent regulatory changes, including the recent RMA reform and compliance around pool fencing. We will also cover some LBP updates from MBIE.

With constant regulatory changes in the building industry, PlaceMakers aims to provide ongoing support to its customers through skills maintenance seminars and Under Construction
“I t’s about doing our bit to support Licensed Building Practitioners (LBPs) by enabling them to earn the necessary skills maintenance points,” says PlaceMakers general manager operations and marketing Gary Woodhouse. “We ensure that PlaceMakers customers can earn all their required elective points through PlaceMakers initiatives, such as reading our monthly Under Construction magazine and attending our seminars.
Next round around the corner For information on the upcoming PlaceMakers Skills Maintenance seminars, which is scheduled for April to June, please contact your local PlaceMakers store.
Who should attend the skills maintenance seminars?
All LBPs, those who have applied for a licence and PlaceMakers customers are welcome to attend. The session is relevant for all licence classes including brick and block layers, roofers and plasterers.
How many LBP points do I earn for attending?
Each seminar is approximately two hours long. Every hour of educational learning is equal to one LBP point, so the seminar is worth two points.
What if I haven’t got my licence yet?
If you have applied for your licence, or are thinking about becoming licensed, you are welcome to attend PlaceMakers skills maintenance seminars; however, remember you must be licensed before you can start earning points.
Keeping records of restricted building work – We can help!
We know it’s tough to keep up with all the paperwork required these days, so we’ve produced a triplicate Record of Work book to give you a hand. It has three colour-coded copies of the memorandum forms for your job details – one for the homeowner, one for the council and one for you to keep. Each book holds up to 25 jobs.
With constant changes to regulations in the building industry, PlaceMakers strive to be the industry leaders in education and development for our customers by providing LBP Skills Maintenance training seminars on an ongoing basis.
It’s doing our bit to support Licensed Building Practitioners (LBP’s) by enabling them to earn the necessary Skills Maintenance Points.  PlaceMakers customers will be able to earn all their points required over a two year period through PlaceMakers initiatives, such as reading our monthly Under Construction Magazine and attending PlaceMakers Skills Maintenance seminars.

There are three types of LBP licensing suspensions: voluntary, relicensing, or disciplinary. Voluntary suspensions are by choice, but relicensing or disciplinary suspension happens as a result of your actions as an LBP
All suspensions appear on your public register page, including the reason for the suspension and whether it was for disciplinary or relicensing reasons. Clients might steer away from you if you have a disciplinary or relicensing suspension history, so maintaining your current licence status can be very important to your reputation and future business.
VOLUNTARY SUSPENSION
You may choose to have your licence (or a class of licence) suspended for up to two years by completing the ‘Voluntary suspension of licence form’. You can end your voluntarily suspension at any time by completing the ‘Ending voluntary suspension of licence form’. You need to continue to maintain your skills while on a voluntary suspension.
These two forms can be found on the LBP website under ‘Suspend or cancel your licence’.
Voluntary suspensions are shown on the public register, but are described as ‘at the request of the practitioner’, to differentiate them from suspensions placed on your licence by the Registrar or Building Practitioners Board.
RELICENSING SUSPENSION
Every year, the Registrar will make contact with you about a month prior to your licence ID card expiring to ensure that you wish to remain licensed.
You can renew your licence online, or contact the LBP licensing team. Your licence will be suspended if:
You do not respond
You don’t pay your yearly licensing fee
You do not complete your skills maintenance (required every two years).
It is important to make contact with the LBP team and renew your licence (which can be done online), because, if your licence is suspended, you will be considered ‘non-licensed’. When you are ‘non-licensed’, you are not able to carry out Restricted Building Work (RBW) unless you’re supervised by a LBP, and you can’t supervise RBW. You also can’t tell people that you are an LBP.
Your suspension is required by law to be shown on the public register for three years. You cannot request to have your suspension history removed.
A suspension can impact on your ability to get jobs as consumers check the public register regularly.
DISCIPLINARY SUSPENSION
The Building Practitioners Board can suspend an LBP’s licence if an LBP commits a disciplinary offence under section 317 of the Building Act 2004.
A disciplinary suspension means you are ‘non-licensed’ and not able to carry out RBW unless you are supervised by an LBP. If your license is suspended by the board, you can’t supervise RBW and you can’t tell people you are an LBP. Your suspension will also be shown on the public register for three years and may impact on your ability to get work.

Legislation passed last year and now in place means councils and building owners have from seven to 35 years to bring buildings up to scratch
The Building (Earthquake-prone Buildings) Amendment Act 2016 addresses a number of problems identified with the way earthquake-prone buildings (EPBs) were managed following the 2010 and 2011 Canterbury earthquakes.
In a statement, Building and Housing Minister Dr Nick Smith said that the new legislation would help save hundreds of lives.
“Earthquakes are New Zealand’s biggest natural hazard risk, with the greatest danger coming from building failures. We cannot completely eliminate the risk to life from quakes but, just as modern cars are safer in an accident, modern buildings are safer in a quake,” said Dr Smith.
“These new laws involve an uncomfortable and inevitable trade-off between safety and cost, but will save hundreds of lives in future quakes when fully implemented.”
He also said that the Government has established an assistance fund for private owners of heritage buildings, and that they were exploring options to assist owners of multi-unit complexes where some parties may struggle to raise their share of strengthening costs.
Regulations are being developed to support the implementation of the Act, including new engineering guidelines to ensure better consistency in the assessment of EPBs.
Figure 1
Shaking down the legislation
An EPB is defined as one that would have its ‘ultimate capacity’ exceeded in an earthquake, and if the building were to collapse, the collapse would likely result in injury, death or damage to nearby buildings.
In practical terms, a building that meets less than 34% of the new building standard is often referred to as earthquake-prone. Parts of a building, such as unreinforced masonry, can also be labelled as earthquake-prone independent of the whole building.
Under the new legislation, territorial authorities (TAs) are required to identify potential EPBs and notify their owners. They must also assign ratings to buildings and publish information about the buildings in a public register, which will be made available online.
Building owners who receive a notification must have their building assessed by a suitably qualified engineer within 12 months and, if it’s labelled as earthquake-prone, carry out remedial work and display a notice on the building declaring it as earthquake-prone. In certain circumstances, TAs may extend the assessment timeframe by a further 12 months.
Risk determines response
To ensure the response required is proportionate to the risk and avoid a ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach, New Zealand has been split into three seismic risk zones (see Figure 1).
The risk zones were determined using the ‘Z’ factor (see table), which defines the seismic hazard factor for each area. A number of buildings within high and medium risk zones have been identified as ‘priority buildings’, these must be identified and remediated within half the time frames of non-priority buildings.
The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment’s (MBIE) Building Performance website describes two key categories of priority building as:
Those that are prescribed in the Building Act, which include certain hospital, emergency and education buildings.
Those that are described in the Building Act and determined with community input, which include parts of unreinforced masonry buildings that could fall in an earthquake onto a thoroughfare with sufficient pedestrian or vehicle traffic to warrant prioritisation, and buildings that could impede transport routes of strategic importance if they were to collapse in an earthquake. Councils will need to undertake public consultation to decide with their communities which buildings and routes or thoroughfares this should apply to.
Excluded buildings
Not all buildings are covered by the Building (Earthquake-prone Buildings) Amendment Act 2016, as the system is designed to focus on those considered most hazardous to public health. Excluded buildings include:
Farm buildings
Retaining walls
Fences
Certain monuments
Wharves
Bridges
Tunnels
Storage tanks
While most residential buildings are excluded from the legislation, there are exceptions. Residential buildings larger than two storeys and containing three or more household units, and residential buildings larger than two storeys used as a hostel, boarding house or other special accommodation are included.
MBIE is also consulting on regulations that may allow some building owners to be granted an exemption from undertaking remedial work. Characteristics of an exempt building may include its use, level of occupancy and location relative to other buildings.

MBIE’s latest guidance aims to resolve common areas of dispute between contractors and homeowners
T he Guide to tolerances, materials and workmanship in new residential construction is now available. Prepared by the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE), it aims to assist contractors and homeowners, who may be unsure of what constitutes a defect within the Building Act 2004.
This guide focuses on issues that can lead to disputes between building contractors and homeowners, but which fall outside the Building Code, contract documentation and manufacturers’ specifications and installation instructions.
It outlines what constitutes acceptable levels of workmanship in standard domestic construction types under normal conditions, and is targeted at new residential building work.
The guidance was written with advice from the industry and supports the new consumer protection measures in Part 4A of the Building Act, which came into law on 1 January.
Under the new consumer protection measures, a 12-month defect repair period starts from:
the completion of the building work under a written contract, or
the completion of the physical building work, in cases where there is no written contract.
During this time, it is the main contractors’ responsibility to fix any defects, or prove that any defective building work is through no fault of their own, the subcontractors under their control, or the products supplied if there is a dispute.
T he Guide to tolerances, materials and workmanship in new residential construction covers mainly aesthetic issues (eg, what is considered a reasonable slope in a floor, or what is an acceptable appearance for a newly painted wall) in new builds and additions at any price, whether or not the consumer protection measures and $30,000 threshold apply.
The guide does not cover tolerances for repairs, renovations, or alterations within existing buildings. Tolerances for existing buildings are likely to be below those achievable with new buildings. There are a number of reasons for this, including the nature of the materials used in existing buildings and the effects of both time and natural events.
It is also a great tool to make sure clients understand and agree what acceptable levels of tolerances, materials and workmanship are for new residential building work. It can be used before contracts are signed, to help align expectations of quality with choice of design, materials, finishes and costs.
The Guide to tolerances, materials and workmanship in new residential construction is not a mandatory set of standards. Contractors and clients can mutually agree to their own expectations, preferably within their written contract.
Assessing Workmanship
While some aspects of materials and workmanship can be measured (eg length, height, depth, angle and scale), other aspects, such as variations in texture, colour, transparency, reflectivity and finish, should be observed and assessed while in a normal viewing position. A normal viewing position is at an unobstructed viewing angle of 45° or more, and if indoors with a uniform typical level of lighting (refer to ‘Critical lighting’ below). Normal viewing positions for specific materials are set out in various Standards or recommendations, and include:
Critical lighting
Unless specifically outlined in the contract, imperfections that are only visible under critical light do not indicate defective workmanship. Critical lighting occurs when sunlight or an intense artificial light source strikes a wall or other flat surface at a low angle, typically 15° or less. Because of the low angle of the light, any small variations or irregularities on the surface cast a relatively large shadow. This can highlight imperfections that would not normally be visible under more diffused lighting conditions.
Critical lighting occurs naturally for a short period each day, typically 30–60 minutes in the early morning and late afternoon when the sun is low in the sky. It is common practice to use high output lighting to accentuate areas requiring attention during the construction phase, but this level of lighting is not suitable for performing a subjective visual inspection of interior surfaces.

In order to get relicensed, LBPs are currently required to accumulate a certain number of skills maintenance points – depending on what licence they hold – over a two-year period.
Points are awarded for a variety of learning activities; these points demonstrate to the Registrar that your skills and industry knowledge are up to date.
You can choose the activities that best suit your needs and the requirements of your licence class. These activities should inform you about things such as changes to the Building Code, building materials, design technologies and good design and building practices.
To get relicensed you must:
Earn the minimum number of points over 24 months specified in your licence class.
Record your activities and claim one point for every hour of learning.
To help decide which activities are right for you, seek out learning activities you feel are relevant to your licence class(es) that should enhance your skills, knowledge and/or productivity. If you’re unsure, consider the competencies that are relevant in Schedule 1 of the LBP rules, available online at www.dbh.govt.nz/lbp-rules-2007
If you hold two or more licensing classes, you need the higher point allocation. For example, if you are licensed in Carpentry and Site and Design – area of practice 2, you need 36 points.
You can update your skills maintenance records using the LBP online system or by recording your points in your work diary. If you choose the latter, you will need to update the ‘record of skills maintenance form’ annually (for which you’ll get a bonus point) or bi-annually. When due, the Registrar will attach the ‘record of skills maintenance form’ with your annual relicensing.
Remember – using the online system, or updating your work diary as you go, is a great way to avoid last-minute panic trying to remember what you’ve done over the past 24 months.
The LBP registrar might ask to see evidence of your skills maintenance, so keep receipts and other evidence that shows what you’ve done. You should keep this evidence for a minimum of two years or longer, depending on your circumstances.
Examples of evidence include:
Tertiary education – certificates or record of learning certificates.
Emails, faxes or letters from the person who organised or paid for the activity.
Pages printed out from a website.
Handouts or meeting agendas.
Photocopies of a DVD case
Seminar flyers or notices.
Details on materials you have read eg, issue and title or voucher.
Documentation about on-the-job training (eg, induction, mentoring, or supervising an apprentice).
As long as you can reasonably show you did the activity, it is up to you to decide to keep a record. It’s a good idea to sign and date your evidence or photocopy, if it doesn’t already have a date on it.

This month, we interviewed Building and Construction Minister Jenney Salesa (who also holds a number of other portfolios) about what she’d like to achieve in her role and where she sees room for improvement in New Zealand’s building system
Building and Construction Minister Jenney Salesa
Q: What do you hope to achieve as Building and Construction Minister?
To build an effective building regulatory system that ensures the buildings New Zealanders use are safe, healthy and durable, and which also supports a productive building and construction sector. This will help enable the sector to build 100,000 affordable homes under the Government’s KiwiBuild policy.
I am working to establish a ministerial group on the Construction Workforce, which will develop a skills strategy for the construction sector. I am also looking for opportunities to further increase capability and capacity in the sector. We know there is an immediate need for skilled workers, but I am also looking to the future to provide skilled construction workers to meet New Zealand’s longterm needs.
Q: What are your responsibilities as Building and Construction Minister, and how do they differ from your responsibilities as Associate Minister of Housing and Urban Development?
The Government wants to make sure people have healthy, secure and affordable homes that meet their needs within thriving communities.
As Associate Minister of Housing and Urban Development, I’ll be supporting a broad programme that looks across the wide range of elements required to make this happen – land, infrastructure, development and construction.
My Building and Construction portfolio has a more targeted focus. It is about regulating building work in New Zealand to protect the public’s safety and to support sustainable development and people’s health, independence and wellbeing.
The building regulatory system influences the construction market by setting performance requirements for building work and processes for council enforcement and construction contracting, and by regulating the people who work in the sector and the building products they use.
Q: What do you think about New Zealand’s current building regulation system?
We have a performance-based system, which specifies how buildings should perform rather than how they should be built. The reason for this is to allow people to innovate by using new designs, methods, products and technologies. This is the right approach to take.
The Building Code is constantly being monitored and refreshed to reflect advances in research and technology. However, the current Building Code system is complex and can be difficult for people to access and understand.
I can see there is room for improvement, and have started work on simplifying how people access and use this system. The performance requirements are also just one part of a complex system. My aim is to take a methodical approach to reform across all parts of the building regulatory system. I will use the opportunity KiwiBuild presents to try out new ways of working, to drive transformation of the construction sector and regulatory system.
Q: What would you like to change about the building regulation system?
I have identified some clear opportunities for improvement. One priority will be supporting KiwiBuild by getting rid of obstacles and inefficiencies that would slow progress and by incentivising innovation and new approaches, including prefabrication and modular construction. I’ll also be progressing broader system reforms that are already under way.
These include a review of the system for regulating building products, making it simpler for people to access and understand the Building Code system and ensuring the pathways for demonstrating compliance are fit for purpose.
Q: How do you think the Government can better work with the building industry to improve its productivity?
In addition to making sure the building regulatory system serves its purpose of protecting the public in a way that’s as speedy and efficient as possible, I’ll be actively engaging on the sector-led Industry Transformation Agenda. This provides a collaborative vehicle for government to help support industry to raise productivity.
Q: Are there any plans in place to introduce a national consenting system and, if so, when is it likely to be rolled out?
We’ll be looking to explore new and innovative ways of doing consenting, but it’s very early days. We’re starting by working closely with the sector and councils in fast-growing areas such as Auckland to explore what can be done to streamline consenting for KiwiBuild in the short term.
Then we’ll be looking at areas where the legislative settings may need to change to support the industry to transform. At this stage, it’s too early in the process to say what the end results of that work will be. In the meantime, we’re supporting council-led initiatives such as GoShift, which sees over 20 councils clustering together to develop consistent, shared systems and resources for building consenting.
Q: What do you think about mandatory guarantees for builders and are they something you would like to see introduced to the industry?
Looking at the way risk, responsibility and liability are distributed in the building process is one of the priority items on my work programme for the next three years.
I’ll be considering options that ensure builders take appropriate responsibility for their work, that prevent councils from being pushed to become over-cautious, and that protect homeowners from risk if things go wrong. This will include looking at the way guarantees and insurance products are used.
However, we’re not yet at the stage where we can say what the Government’s role will be in developing the market for guarantees and insurance products. In the meantime, I encourage homeowners and builders to ‘Build It Right’ by making sure they understand their rights and responsibilities, including the consumer protection measures that are already in place.
There’s more information available at www.building.govt.nz.
Q: How successful do you think the LBP programme has been and are you looking at ways it can be improved?
It’s important to have a way to make sure the people who carry out or supervise building work, especially Restricted Building Work, are competent and accountable, so that the public can make informed choices about who to employ for building work.
The LBP scheme now has in excess of 25,000 members, and represents a big step forward in achieving these goals. It’s also important to make sure we understand exactly how well the scheme is performing and whether it remains fit for purpose, which is why MBIE is undertaking an evaluation of the scheme’s first ten years of operation.
The evaluation is set to be complete in June 2018.
In the meantime, MBIE, in conjunction with Building Practitioners Board, is continuously looking at ways to improve and make the scheme function better.
Q: Given the current skills shortage, how do you think more women can be encouraged into building and related trades and is that an area you are planning to do some work in?
At the moment, the make-up of the building and construction industry doesn’t reflect the make-up of New Zealand. There’s an opportunity to help more groups who are currently underrepresented in the industry, such as women, to take advantage of the opportunity that’s there, particularly with KiwiBuild getting under way.
In my role as Associate Minister of Education, I will be working with building industry stakeholders, as well as the Ministerial Group I mentioned earlier, to develop a skills strategy to ensure the sector has a workforce that is fit for purpose – as part of that work, I will be looking at how we can encourage and support all kinds of people, including women, into the workforce.

Two years after Restricted Building Work came into effect, commitment to skills maintenance appears to be growing stronger.
With more builders signing up to receive Under Construction, and continued enquiries about further skills maintenance seminars, presenter John Tait has embarked on his cross-country tour to deliver PlaceMakers’ sixth round of sessions.
“There’s no shortage of material to cover, given the continuous changes taking place across the industry,” says John. “We’ll do our best to present it in an easily digestible way and allow plenty of time for questions.”
Skills maintenance update – news on the skills maintenance review, how to keep good records of your learning, the increasing number of licence complaints and what we can learn from the published complaints
Worksafe – details about the new health and safety-focused agency and what you need to do to ensure you’re compliant
Building Act changes – the importance of construction contracts, disclosure of information, implied warranties, defects, the yet-to-be implemented risk-based consenting and much more
Common problems – find out what issues building contractors are encountering around the country and avoid making them yourself
John will also discuss the importance of paying close attention to the building design and the products being used, as they are both integral components of the end result; if a problem is found with either, it could affect you and your licence status.
Don’t miss out on the well-researched information presented in those seminars!

The Building and Construction Productivity Partnership project targets ‘time wasting’ in residential construction.
Ever wondered where all that time went? According to a recent homeowner’s satisfaction survey conducted by BRANZ, less than 60% of respondents were happy with the amount of time it took to complete their home.
A recent value stream mapping project, completed by the Building and Construction Productivity Partnership and BRANZ, aimed to identify where waste occurs in the construction of residential buildings. It maps the steps in the construction process and quantifies the importance of each in providing value (defined as functionality and market value) to the end-user.
This plan can then be used to improve or eliminate certain steps in order to reduce the time taken on a residential build, thereby reducing costs and improving productivity.
The building and construction sector employs approximately 8% of New Zealand’s workforce and is a major contributor (about 5%) to the country’s GDP. However, it’s been acknowledged throughout the industry that sector productivity has been flat, and at times negative, over the past15 years. With a significant building boom on the horizon, The Partnership(a partnership of industry and government established through MBIE in 2010) set out to addresslow productivity by researching building processes.
The Partnership’s value project involved four steps:
Market segmentation: Identifying the segments which might benefit the most from a value stream mapping exercise.
Value stream mapping: Identifying whether processes are value-adding, non-value adding but necessary, or non-value adding. By determining what benefits processes offer, areas of ‘waste’ can be targeted.
Process mapping: Going into more detail about the actual design, tender, consent and contractual processes to determine what aspects are value-adding, non-value adding but necessary, or non-value adding.
Future state mapping: Realigning the procedure to avoid the processes – or parts of the processes – which have been deemed low or non-value adding.
Small and medium-sized residential building companies was the segment of focus for the initial process, though many of the productivity improvements identified will be applicable to the whole residential sector. A wide range of participants from the sector were involved in the project.
According to the research, the top three areas where house construction productivity can be improved are:
Early project stages, including scoping, design and site selection.
Consenting and tendering processes.
Project planning and project management, particularly whois on site and when.
Client knowledge and behaviour also have a significant impact on productivity.
It is recommended that the following four areas are targeted for productivity improvements in the small builder/new housing market:
1.  Client education
Improving client knowledge and understanding of the design and building process could reduce thetime taken to finalise the design stage from 25 to 10 weeks.
2.  Consenting and tendering processes
Standardising contracts, improving technology use and having an effective online consenting process could save up to 20 working days.
3.  Project planning and project management
Increasing the use of software products tailored specifically for the residential building market, in addition to increased training in building and construction-related project management, could reduce construction time from 15 to 9 weeks.
4.  Technical solutions to reduce weather delays
Cost effective and practical technical solutions for small builders in the residential market will result in considerable time savings.
Other countries affected by similar weather conditions have already developed and put in place solutions to avoid delays to the construction process and subsequent productivity constraints – New Zealand has yet to do so on a significant scale.
” Cost effective and practical technical solutions for small builders in the residential market will result in considerable time savings
Once implemented, these improvements have a potentialvalue of $113 million per annum by 2020, representing an improvement of up to 2.7% in productivity. Further savings are likely from the overall productivity gains that result whenall building activities in the processare performed more quickly.
For more detailed advice on how to use these recommendations, see the full report at: http://buildingvalue.co.nz/sites/all/themes/productivity/images/Wrap/VALUE_STREAM_MAPPING_PROJECT.pdf

Three cases recently brought before the Building Practitioners Board highlighted the importance of acting with honesty and integrity
Ronald Carmichael, Zi Xiang Lin (also known as Jiew Chong) and Steven Morrow all had their licenses cancelled after it was found they brought the LBP scheme into disrepute.
Zi Xiang Lin
Hamilton-based Lin, who acted fraudulently by using false information and making a false declaration when applying for his Brick and Blocklaying licence, was found to have:
Been convicted of an offence punishable by imprisonment for six months or more that reflects adversely on his fitness to carry out building work.
Made a false and misleading declaration for the purpose of becoming licensed.
Acted in a manner that would bring the LBP scheme into disrepute.
As a result, his licence was cancelled, with a stand-down period of five years before he can reapply.
Steven Morrow
Morrow, also based in Hamilton, held Carpentry and Foundations licenses. He was previously imprisoned for two years after being convicted of offences under the Tax Administration Act, which the Board determined was linked to Mr Morrow’s fitness to be licensed. The board found that he had:
Been convicted of an offence punishable by imprisonment for six months or more that reflects adversely on his fitness to carry out building work
Acted in a manner that would bring the LBP scheme into disrepute.
The Board cancelled Mr Morrow’s licences, with a stand-down period of three years before he can reapply.
Ronald Carmichael
Christchurch-based Carmichael, who held a Carpentry licence, was engaged to build a new dwelling. He incorrectly quoted the cost of the building, meaning that final costs were $100,000 above the contract price.
He also failed to correctly read and interpret the plans and to price the project based on the actual size of the dwelling and the materials required.
The homeowner also stated that she had not received a record of work from Mr Carmichael and that he had refused to provide one. The territorial authority did not receive a copy, despite his claims to the contrary.
The board found that Mr Carmichael:
Carried out building work in a negligent or incompetent manner
Failed to provide a record of work as required by the Building Act
Acted in a manner that would bring the LBP scheme into disrepute.
Mr Carmichael also did not meet the requirements of Part 4A of the Building Act 2004 in relation to contracts for building work. Variations (described as ‘extras’) were not dealt with in accordance of the legislative requirements.
The Board cancelled Mr Carmichael’s licence with a stand-down period of 24 months before he can reapply.
All three men were also required to pay costs towards their inquiries. A more in-depth article on the LBP scheme and the above cases will feature in the upcoming print issue of Under Construction.
Key learnings
As an LBP, it’s critical you understand your regulatory and contractual obligations. Work that costs $30,000 or more (including GST) requires a written contract by law, along with the requirement that certain other documents be provided BEFORE any building work is started.
NZS 3902:2004 is a standard building contract you can use for clients/home owners who engage you to build their house, or undertake simple building work or alterations. MBIE has sponsored access for anyone to view and print this standard at no charge.
How you conduct yourself is also important. If you are convicted of certain offences that reflect adversely on your fitness to hold a licence, you could have your licence cancelled even if the offending occurred before you were licensed.

BCITO is experiencing unprecedented growth in the number of new apprenticeships, but the industry is still woefully short of skilled tradespeople. Plan your labour needs now, so you can capitalise on future business opportunities
In 2014, the BCITO has averaged 106 new sign-ups per week and recently recruited its 9000th apprentice – yet BCITO chief executive Ruma Karaitiana says it’s still not enough to meet growing demand.
“All of the construction trades across the board, from carpentry, to painting, to brick and block laying, are under huge amounts of pressure. All the data says this pressure will continue into the 2020s,” Mr Karaitiana says.
“We’ve come out of a period of recession, where we weren’t building enough houses to maintain normal demand, particularly in Auckland. Then we had the Christchurch earthquakes leading to large rebuild projects, which has only compounded the pressure. The combined effects have resulted in an extremely high demand for skilled tradespeople; we simply don’t have the numbers to meet that demand.”
He says the industry needs to spend more time and resources planning its future skills and labour needs in collaboration with individual businesses.
“Construction businesses need to think about what their business demands are next year and then decide what they can do now to meet those demands.”
While thinking and planning is largely based on individual order books, Mr Karaitiana believes businesses also need to step back and look at future industry trends, which are predicting more growth.
“One of the very real challenges we have is around the population – the construction industry wants the same people that the engineering, farming and technology sectors want. Planning for the construction industry means we need to understand what people might be available in the marketplace, and decide if we need to be more pre-emptive with our training and hiring decisions.”
Auckland’s Deniro Larsen-Marsters is the BCITO’s 9,000 th apprentice and a graduate of Te Puni Kokiri’s Maori Cadetship Programme. Active since mid-2013, and in partnership with BCITO, the programme supports Maori tradespeople to become qualified, helping to alleviate demand for skilled workers.
The six-month cadetship is designed to give Maori in full-time employment the skills and experience to prepare them for further training and a career in the construction industry. Cadets are encouraged to transfer into an apprenticeship through BCITO, where they can go on to become qualified tradespeople or project site managers.
If you’re an employer looking for an apprentice, BCITO may be able to put you in contact with a career seeker. Simply call BCITO on 0800 422 486 . Through BCITO’s job matching service they can search their database and see if anyone matches your requirements or check out the information available for employers at at www.bcito.org.nz/employers-and-industry/employers .

The Building Practitioners Board (BPB) Annual Report for 2023/24, released in October 2024, provides a comprehensive overview of the Board’s activities and the state of the Licensed Building Practitioners (LBP) scheme in New Zealand. The latest report reveals that the Code of Ethics is having an impact on LBPs, and that complaint numbers are roughly holding steady compared to previous years
The BPB, established under Part 4 of the Building Act 2004, is responsible for overseeing the LBP scheme. Its primary functions include hearing appeals against licensing decisions, investigating and hearing complaints about LBPs, approving rules related to LBPs, and annually reviewing and reporting on its operations to the Minister for Building and Construction. The Board operates independently but is supported by the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) in performing its duties.​
In 2023/24, the Board report revealed it received, considered, initiated or upheld:
180 complaints.
29 licensing appeals.
193 investigations.
234 complaints / board enquiries.
16 inquiries.
71 complaints / board inquiries.
Appeals
The Board exceeded its target to determine 85% of appeals within 60 working days of receipt of the complete appeal, with 90% of appeals determined within the required timeframe.
Complaints
Any person may complain to the Board about the conduct of an LBP. The number of complaints received for 2023/2024 (180) remained around the same level as previous years (169 in 2021/22 and 209 in 2022/23). Of those 180 complaints, 95 did not proceed to a hearing.
A complaint may not proceed to a hearing for various reason, including, but not limited to:
If it is found not to come within at least one of the grounds for discipline.
If the subject of the complaint is found to be minor or trivial.
If investigation is not practicable or is unnecessary.
If the complaint is found to be frivolous, vexatious or not made in good faith.
The 16 inquiries initiated by the Board in 2023/24 was five more than in 2022/23 but nine less than in 2021/22.
92% of complaints were determined within 60 working days of the date of the hearing.
Of the 91 complaints/board inquiries heard in 2023/24, 71 (77%) were upheld
“The number of LBPs disciplined equates to less than 1% of the total number of licences held in the Scheme,” stated the report.
Notably, there was an increase in complaints alleging breaches of the LBP Code of Ethics, reflecting the Code’s growing influence since its enforcement began in October 2022.
“The number of complaints that allege or include an allegation of a breach of the Code of Ethics for LBPs or disreputable conduct has increased,” said Board Chair Mel Orange. “While that was expected with the introduction of the Code, the overall number of complaints and the matters complained about have not been as high or as serious as was anticipated.”
Other common complaint themes included:
LBPs using building consent authorities as quality control.
“[Where] LBPs have relied on the inspection or consent process to identify issues with work, rather than building or designing it right the first time,” stated the report.
Poor application of supervision.
“Poor or inadequate supervision of non-licensed persons resulting in noncompliant building work continues to be a theme.”.
Failure to obtain a building consent.
“An LBP proceeds with work that requires a building consent without first ensuring that one is in place.”
Failing to provide a Record of Work once Restricted Building Work is complete.
“Record of work complaints continue to be disproportionately high, and some LBPs are still withholding them for payment reasons. LBPs are not allowed to withhold Records of Work to extract payment from clients.”
Negligent or incompetent building work.
“This is the most common ground of complaint. It can include design work and unconsented building work.”
False belief that working as a sub-contractor eliminates LBP obligations.
Penalties
Fines were the most common penalty – imposed in 56 of 74 cases. The next most common penalty was censure (8), followed by licence cancellation (7).
“Of those LBPs disciplined, the Board ordered that further publication of the decision be carried out for 15 LBPs to alert the industry and public to the severity of their offending,” stated the report. “The Board only orders further publication of an LBP’s name and offending when there is a perceived need for the public and/or profession to know the findings of the hearing.”
For Code of Ethics breaches, the Board will be moving away from educative approaches when imposing penalties in favour of a more punitive approach, said Board Chair Orange.
Operational enhancements
To streamline operations, the Board has implemented measures such as remote hearing systems and draft decision processes. These initiatives have facilitated fair and efficient hearings while reducing costs and disruptions for witnesses. The Board continues to focus on enhancing its processes to maintain the integrity and effectiveness of the LBP scheme.

MBIE releases new consumer protection rules and guidance for builders and homeowners regarding consumer protection measures
New consumer protection measures, included in the Building Amendment Act 2013, came into force on 1 January 2015.
According to MBIE, the new measures have been adopted in response to consumers having little ability to distinguish between practitioners who have a good business history and repeatedly turn out quality building work, and those who use low-skilled labour, take shortcuts and do not stand behind their work. This type of behaviour creates an imbalance in the sector, as poorly performing practitioners often experience competitive advantage over their better-performing counterparts.
MBIE suggests that this is largely due to consumers often selecting building contractors solely on the basis of price alone, with little value placed on a practitioner’s overall credentials and in-service track record. The ministry seeks to rebalance this lack of transparency through the implementation of the new consumer protection measures.
The changes will require building contractors undertaking residential building work valued at more than $30,000 to have written contracts, provide information on their relevant skills, experience and qualifications and disclose their insurance and warranty cover. If the building work is valued at less than $30,000, the above information is required only if specifically requested by the homeowner. For all building work, building contractors must provide maintenance information, particularly if this could affect the validity of a guarantee or warranty.
The Building (Residential Consumer Rights and Remedies) Regulations , found on legislation.govt.nz, includes revised Schedules 1, 2 & 3.
Schedule 1: lists the prescribed disclosure information in detail, which includes information about the building contractor, the key contact person, insurance policies and any guarantees or warranties.
Schedule 2: outlines the prescribed checklist, which a building contractor is required to provide to the homeowner if;
The building work is going to cost $30,000 (including GST) or more; or
The homeowner requests the checklist and the prescribed disclosure information.
The checklist, available on MBIE’s website, outlines the steps homeowners should take to ensure a smooth building process. The steps include detailed information on getting informed, agreeing on project structure and management, hiring competent building contractors, agreeing on price and payments, getting a written contract, establishing clear lines of communication and resolving disputes.
Schedule 3: defines the implied terms associated with residential building contracts, known as default clauses. The default clauses cover many aspects of a building project, including that the contractor is responsible for obtaining all consents and approvals on behalf of the client, and that the contractor may not submit a final payment claim until the Code Compliance Certificate has been provided. It also covers variations, payments, subcontractors, dispute resolution and notices.
These clauses only apply if there is no written contract, or no clause on the same topic in your contract. In other words, a default clause won’t override an existing clause in your contract on a similar topic.
NOTE: It’s not recommended to rely on the default clauses as the terms and conditions of your contract, as they may not be favourable to your situation or appropriate for your particular building project.
The Government has also released Building (Infringement Offences, Fees and Forms) Amendment Regulations 2014 , which includes updated infringement offences and fees.
The regulations prescribe three new infringement offences related to the new consumer protection measures for the actions below:
Failing to provide a prescribed checklist or the prescribed disclosure information to a client, before entering into a contract for residential building work.
Failing to have a written contract for residential building work where the price is $30,000 or more.
Failing to provide information or documentation that is required to be provided to a client and a territorial authority on completion of residential building work.
While the new regulations are motivated by protecting consumers, MBIE says the new measures will also help protect builders, particularly those who haven’t been using written contracts. Most disputes come back to what’s written in the contract.
Implied warranties, which cover almost all aspects of building work, still apply to all residential building work for up to 10 years, regardless of whether or not there is a written contract or what the contract terms are. Until now, if the homeowner (or subsequent owner if the house has been sold) identified a defect during this period, he/she would have to prove that it was a defect.
However, the Building Act has been amended to introduce a 12-month reverse-onus warranty for residential building work. During this time, the homeowner will have 12 months from completion to notify the building contractor in writing of a defect, in which case the building contractor must fix it within a reasonable time. The completion date is when all the physical building work agreed to by you and the owner has been finished.
If there is a dispute, it is your responsibility to prove that any defects are through no fault of your own (or the products you’ve used). This applies to all contracts between a homeowner and a building contractor – not just contracts over $30,000.
Additional guidance – one for homeowners and one for builders – has now been released. All resources are available for download from www.doyourhomework.co.nz and Under Construction will feature its content over the next few months.

As long as builders carry out their due diligence, leaky home repairs can provide a continuous stream of steady work.
This article, based on weathertight remediation workshops run by MBIE – Building and Housing Group, is the last in the series and outlines some considerations builders should take into account before, during and after such a project.
In this article, we will be investigating ‘where to from here?’ for a builder who may be considering this line of work, or who is maybe just looking for more information on the whole subject.
Builders carry a potential risk on all construction projects, and leaky building remediation projects are no exception. Typically, builders get work through word of mouth or existing relationships. However, to secure this type of work, it may be necessary to approach organisations not previously considered for new opportunities.
As mentioned previously, the qualification and experience of designers and those professionals involved is critical to minimising a builder’s risk and maximising the success of the overall project.
There are now a number of companies and individuals specialising in remediation projects, with varying skills and competence. Some of these may belong to industry bodies such as the New Zealand Institute of Building Surveyors (NZIBS), which has prerequisites for membership and provides training and certification specifically related to such work.
“Builders carry a latent risk on all construction projects and leaky building remediation projects are no exception
You should always assess the suitability of those involved in a project and not be afraid to walk away if you do not believe they are sufficiently skilled or experienced. In some circumstances, the risk to a builder can be too great.
There are also builders out there offering a ‘one-stop shop’ option to building owners by effectively providing a design and build service. However, by doing so, they take on the additional design risk, arguably significantly increasing their exposure as a whole.
The building industry has to adapt to changes to the Building Act, Building Code and Health and Safety compliance to name but a few. With the Licensed Building Practitioner (LBP) scheme, builders must keep abreast of these changes and continue to up-skill in order to continue to do Restricted Building Work (RBW), which leaky building remediation usually is.
MBIE’s Building and Housing group runs various ongoing training courses, such as the Weathertightness Induction Course for builders. It also produces some very useful guidance, which, while not specifically targeted at builders, provides highly relevant information on many parts of the process.
“Remediating leaky buildings is a challenge but also an opportunity
These guides cover topics such as identifying the riskier features of a building, various investigation techniques, understanding the owner’s position and design considerations.

Earlier in 2022, the Licensed Building Practitioner (LBP) board held hearings following complaints against two Licensed Building Practitioners. What follows is the Board’s judgements
Earlier this year the Building Practitioners Board held a hearing following a complaint against Licensed Building Practitioner (LBP) David Jaquiery.
Following a complaint, the Board decided to investigate:
Whether the LBP had carried out or inspected work negligently.
Whether the work did not comply with a building consent.
Both of these are grounds for discipline under s317 of the Building Act.
The Board gave notice that they would also investigate:
Whether the LBP carried out work before a building consent was issued.
An alleged failure to have building inspections carried out.
The Board also looked at:
Non-compliance issues set out in Site Notices and Reports.
Notices to Fix and Stop Work that were issued.
Any further issues raised by the Special Advisor to the Board.
Respondent 1
David Jaquiery is licensed in 4 licence classes:
Carpentry.
Site AOP 2.
Design AOP 3.
Areas of practice within the roofing class (including the Roof Membrane, Torch-on Roof Membrane, Liquid Membrane, Shingle or Slate, and the Profiled Metal Roof and/or Wall Cladding areas of practice).
Background
Jaquiery was engaged by the body corporate of a 5-storey multi-unit building to prepare a proposal for, and then carry out, remedial works.
This work included:
The waterproofing of the existing membrane flat roofs.
Concrete nib walls.
Exterior plastered cavity wall systems.
Deck membranes with new balustrades.
Replacing most of the exterior joinery.
He applied for building consent early in January 2020. After several requests for more information, a consent was granted on 1 July 2020. There were nine required council inspections listed in the consent.
Evidence
The Special Advisor found that Restricted Building Work (RBW) was carried out before the building consent was issued.
Jaquiery did not agree with the extent of that work listed in the Advisor’s report but did state: “The work progress on the 13th of July was about 50% of the contract works was done.”
Jaquiery put forward five justifications for starting work before the building consent was issued. The Board did not accept any of these.
The first council inspection was carried out on 13 July 2020. It was found that none of the required inspections up to that time had been carried out. Jaquiery stated that these requirements “made him laugh” as many of them were not needed.
Three more site notices were issued, each noting that:
No council inspections had taken place.
No further work was to be carried out.
A Notice to Fix was issued in late September 2020. Work continued to be carried out during that time.
The Special Advisor found four instances of work not completed in accordance with the consented drawings:
Membrane from the deck had been taken up over the cladding preventing moisture in the cavity from escape.
Upstands to joinery were insufficient.
The gap between the cladding and deck was insufficient.
Scupper sizes did not comply with E2.
A further issue of ponding on the decks which suggested they did not have the minimum falls required by the Building Code was not able to be proven from the photographic and documented evidence used for his report.
Jaquiery’s responses to all the issues raised was consistent — the job was not yet complete, or what he had done was acceptable unless the council required more, in which case he would do what they required.
The Board noted that Jaquiery’s prevailing attitude was that he could undertake the work and then concern himself with compliance issues only if the council picked it up during their inspections. This ‘mop up’ approach is unacceptable and contrary to the statutory process and purpose of the Act.
The Board’s conclusion
The Board decided that Jaquiery has carried out or supervised building work:
In a negligent manner.
That does not comply with the building consent.
Jaquiery was ordered to pay both:
A fine of $4,500.
Costs of $8,000.
It was also decided that the Board’s action was to be recorded on the Register of Licensed Building Practitioners as well as being publicly notified.
RESPONDENT 2
The Board has chosen to publish the details of Desmond Allen’s hearing due to the Licensed Building Practitioner (LBP):
Carrying out or supervising building work in a negligent manner.
Conducting themselves in a manner that brings the LBP regime into disrepute.
Negligence and/or incompetence
The homeowner contracted Allen to act as a project manager for the conversion of a standalone garage into a habitable space. Before the start of the project, Allen had completed the design for the conversion.
The work started in March 2021 and progressed to a stage where internal framing had been carried out and a prewire completed. In mid-March 2021, plumbing was to commence, but the plumbers engaged by Allen refused to progress the work on the basis that a building consent was needed. At that stage, Allen had invoiced and been paid 90% of the project price.
However, none of the external door units, kitchen cabinetry, bathroom fixtures and fittings or floor coverings paid for were on site. The garage door was still in place, none of the external walls had been altered, and only the internal partitions were in place with some GIB board fixed.
There was no progress on site for four months until August 2021, when Allen assured the homeowners that he would complete a building consent application and submit it to the council.
The Board was provided with copies of correspondence between the homeowner and Allen in September 2021, where Allen stated he had submitted the building consent application and that it was being progressed:
“I have just called one of the building inspectors and he said they are still processing the consent and said it is very rare that a consent [would be] issued before the 20 working days are up”.
In November 2021, the homeowner contacted the council to check on progress with the building consent and was advised that no building consent applications had been received with respect to the property.
Therefore, the Board’s considerations in relation to negligence and/or incompetence relate to Allen’s failure to:
Obtain a building consent.
Advise that a resource consent was required for the change of use.
Bringing the licensing regime into disrepute
With respect to conduct that brings the LBP regime into disrepute, the Board noted that Allen had taken 90% of the funds intended to complete the work but did not take the work beyond the early stages of construction. He has not returned any funds or delivered any materials, fittings or fixtures that have been paid for. Put simply, Allen took the money and has not applied it to the purposes for which it was received. The homeowner has had to resort to legal measures to try and recover the funds.
The Board found that Allen’s conduct has resulted in him obtaining a financial gain at the expense of the homeowner. Such conduct in the Board’s view brings the LBP regime into disrepute.
The Board’s decision
The licensing regime exists to ensure the public can have confidence in those who carry out Restricted Building Work which is integral to the safe and healthy functioning of a home. A practitioner who fails to display the required competencies puts those objects at risk.
Taking all of the above factors into account, the Board decided to:
Suspend Allen’s LBP licence for nine months.
Order Allen to pay costs of $3,500.
The Board’s disciplinary findings will be recorded on the public register for three years.
What we can learn from this decision Building work must be carried out to industry standard. The necessary consents need to be obtained from the territorial authorities before the commencement of works.
It is also important that LBPs display a high standard of behaviour when dealing with clients. The LBP scheme is a professional organisation, and all of our dealings with the public, our clients, and the Board should reflect that professionalism.
This article is an excerpt from Codewords Issue 110. Reading Codewords articles that are relevant to your licence class is a mandatory requirement for Licensed Building Practitioners. These questions can be answered through the LBP portal, online on the Under Construction website or recorded on the magazine, then provided at the time of renewal.

Consultation closed around the Licensed Building Practitioner (LBP) scheme
As part of the second phase of the Building System Legislative Reform Programme (the Reform Programme), the government is in the process of determining changes to the LBP scheme with the aim of improving accountability, efficiency and fairness. LBP submissions regarding supervision, licence classes and competency requirements were collected April to June this year.
In its discussion document released early 2021, MBIE sought feedback with the following questions:
We want to know if supervision is working as originally intended and what we can do to improve it?
Do the current licence classes reflect what needs to be regulated in the building industry? Does the current class structure need changing to recognise experience?
Should the competencies for entry into the scheme be lifted, should there be more emphasis on formal education and training and how well are the assessment and skills maintenance processes working?
According to MBIE, updating the LBP scheme will mean builders and designers have the right skills, knowledge, and experience to do quality building work and increase consumer confidence in the scheme.
Bringing scheme up to speed
In the discussion document, Minister for Building and Construction, Poto Williams, noted the LBP scheme was introduced in 2007 to help address gaps in the performance-based regulatory system that were exposed during the leaky homes crisis.
“The scheme has not been reviewed as a whole since it was introduced and has not kept up with all the changes in the building sector,” said Williams.
“The LBP workforce and the wider building system has continued to evolve and become more specialised, and demands on builders have increased. I would therefore like to use this opportunity to test issues that have been brought up over the past 15 years with those who know the scheme best. These issues have been informed by those in the industry and building consent authorities through previous consultation, as well as those who manage the scheme itself.”
Strengthening the LBP scheme is part of the second phase of the government’s Building System Legislative Reform Programme (the Reform Programme), and this is the second consultation with LBPs in the past year. The first consultation gathered feedback from LBPs regarding the introduction of a code of ethics, changes to the licensing administration process for LBPs and changes to the Board’s role in complaints and discipline.
MBIE said in its discussion document that stakeholders raised concerns that the scheme has low entry requirements during another 2019 consultation. This sentiment was echoed in last issue’s Builders’ Business section, available online.
Next, MBIE will analyse the feedback received and use it to prepare advice to the Minister for Building and Construction on options to improve the LBP scheme. These options may include recommending changes to the licence classes and structure, and/or changes to the minimum standards to enter the scheme and continue to be licensed.
The results of the consultation and intended next steps will be covered in upcoming issues of Under Construction .

The fifth article in the series looking at the history of the Licensed Building Practitioners Scheme with MBIE’s Bruce Duggan
The Building Act 2004 introduced the concept of Restricted Building Work (RBW). RBW is work that is critical to the integrity of a building, and under the Act, Licensed Building Practitioners (LBPs) are required to design and carry it out.
Following extensive work with industry, the framework on which the Licensed Building Practitioner Scheme would operate was developed and refined, was officially established in November 2007.
On 28 February 2008, the first building practitioner’s licence was granted – BP100001.
At that stage, it was optional to hold a licence, and RBW wouldn’t become law for another four years – 1 March 2012.
Today, we have just over 27,000 LBPs holding 31,700 licences. Almost 4,400 practitioners are licensed in multiple licence classes.
MBIE is the regulator of the LBP Scheme
In 2004, the Building Industry Authority (BIA) was disestablished and its functions were transferred to the new Department of Building and Housing (DBH), which in turn was integrated into the Ministry of Business Innovation and Employment (MBIE), which began operating on 1 July 2012. The Occupational Regulation team within Te Whakatairanga Service Delivery, which sits within MBIE, ensure the efficient ongoing administration of the LBP Scheme.
The Service Centre is the first point of contact for most LBPs. Service Centre staff are dedicated, knowledgeable, and will pass requests that require a decision to Occupational Regulation. You can reach the Service Centre on 0800 60 60 50.
The Building Practitioners Board
The Building Practitioners Board is a statutory body, independent from MBIE, whose members are appointed by the Minister for Building and Construction. Its role is to hear appeals against licensing decisions made by the Registrar, to investigate and hear complaints against the conduct of LBPs, to approve the LBP Rules, and to submit an annual report to the Minister.
The wrong end of the stick… After nine years of it being mandatory for RBW to be carried out or supervised by LBPs, there are still a few things about the Scheme that continue to cause concern amongst some practitioners. They are addressed below.
1. Accountability vs liability
Many practitioners are still under the impression that becoming an LBP increases their liability when carrying out their work – this is not correct. When a practitioner is granted a licence, they become accountable to the Building Practitioners Board. The practitioner still operates under the same liabilities, or legal responsibilities they have always had under the Building Act and Regulations, and any other relevant laws.
To try and make this clearer, if the Board upholds a complaint against an LBP, the penalty doesn’t affect anyone outside the Scheme. For example, an order to undergo formal training or cancellation of a licence only impacts the practitioner. If an LBP is penalised with a fine, it can’t be passed onto the complainant as compensation.
Whereas, if the LBP has been found guilty in a court of law of carrying out illegal work, they could be held liable to pay for any damage and/or fix the problem and/or pay compensation to the owner – this liability has not changed due to becoming an LBP.
2. Holding a Building Practitioner’s Licence
Applying for and being granted a building practitioner’s licence is not the same as joining a membership organisation (of which there are many), a club or a group where there is an expectation of ‘value for money’– it is more akin to having your driver’s licence. The LBP Scheme is a regulatory one with two purposes:
To ensure that building practitioners are assessed as having the necessary skills and knowledge to carry out the work.
To enable consumers to make informed choices.
The purpose of restricted building work is:
To ensure that important aspects of building work are carried out or supervised by practitioners (LBPs) who have been assessed as being competent.
One of the aims of licensing is to promote, recognise, and support professional skills and knowledge in the sector. When you complete a certificate or record of work, you are stating that you carried out and/or supervised all of the work under that document, and you are stating that it was carried out correctly. Why wouldn’t you want to do this if you believe you are good at your job ? The only time this could present a problem to you is if you carried out, or allowed incompetent work to be carried out, under your supervision.
When you’re driving on our roads, you hope and trust that that person driving towards you has been assessed as competent and holds a current driver’s licence. The consumer also wants to know that the person they are trusting to carry out what is often the biggest financial outlay of their lives has been assessed as competent and holds a current licence to carry out that work.
3. Maintaining currency of skills and knowledge
However, just being assessed initially does not provide the certainty for the consumer that the practitioner is competent several years later, especially considering the fast-changing environment that we work in. It seems that every time we turn around there’s a new product, or an old trusted product has a whole new way of being installed, or there is a design solution that is completely new and not used before.
Undoubtedly one of the most contentious requirements of the LBP Scheme is continuing professional development, or, as we know it, skills maintenance. Some say it’s too easy, for others it’s too hard, and for some, it’s just not relevant. To find its relevance, we need to go back to the enabling document reproduced in the previous issue – which instructed that the legislation leads to ‘a well-informed sector that shares information and quickly identifies and corrects problems’.
Thus, ‘a well-informed sector’ and skills maintenance will be the subject of the next issue of the History of LBP.
This article is an excerpt from Codewords Issue 104. Reading Codewords articles that are relevant to your licence class is a mandatory requirement for Licensed Building Practitioners. These questions can be answered through the LBP portal, online at underconstruction.placemakers.co.nz or recorded on the magazine, then provided at the time of renewal.

No LBP likes to find out someone’s made an official complaint about them, but knowing what the process entails can help make the situation less painful.
The Building Practitioner’s Board is a specialist tribunal responsible for hearing and investigating complaints about licensed building practitioners (LBPs), as well as disciplining those whose work or conduct doesn’t meet the scheme’s standards.
If the Board receives a complaint about you, it will inform you in writing. If the complaint is about LBPs who are licensed under another occupational licensing scheme, such as Registered Architects, there are provisions to refer the complaint to that organisation’s disciplinary body.
If the Board decides the complaint about you requires investigation, it will ask the registrar to report on the complaint. It may also appoint an independent special advisor to help with the investigation.
The Registrar will send you a copy of thecomplaint and ask you to respond. Should you disagree with the complaint, you can give the Registrar any information or evidence to support your side of the argument.
The Registrar may contact you, or the person that complained about you, for more information. Once satisfied, the Registrar will report the details of the complaint to the Board. This will include a summary of the facts and any points upon which you and the complainant disagree. Both you and the complainant will receive that report.
When the Board receives the Registrar’s report, it will decide if your conduct or work comes within the ‘grounds for discipline’, as detailed in section 317 of the Building Act 2004. If there are no grounds for discipline, the Board will dismiss the complaint.
If there are grounds for discipline, then the Board will proceed to a complaint hearing. In many cases, this will involve a second, more detailed report on what occurred and all parties will receive copies of this report.
You can be disciplined if you:
Carried out or supervised work negligently or incompetently.
Carried out or supervised work that does not comply with a building consent.
Portray yourself as being licensed for work that you’re not to licensed to do.
Carried out or supervised restricted building work you’re not licensed to do.
Have been convicted of an offence that affects your fitness to do building work.
Gave false information to get licensed.
Failed, without good reason, to provide a certificate of work for a building consent application.
Failed, without good reason, to provide a record of work to the council or the property owner.
Misrepresented your competence.
Carried out or supervised work outside your competence.
Failed to produce your licence or notify a change in circumstances (eg, your licence has been suspended or cancelled)
Conducted yourself in a manner that brings, or is likely to bring, the LBP scheme into disrepute.
To find out more about what you should bring to a complaint hearing and the possible penalties, visit www.business.govt.nz/lbp
Next month we’ll go into more depth about recent LBP complaint appeals and the outcomes.

Builder convicted on two charges of falsely claiming to be a Licensed Building Practitioner
Albany-based builder Blair Cole has been fined $5000 and ordered to pay court costs and $1296 in reparation to an Orewa homeowner for falsely claiming to be a Licensed Building Practitioner (LBP).
The case against Mr Cole was brought to the North Shore District Court by the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) Occupational Licensing Team.
According to investigations team leader Simon Thomas, Mr Cole, who trades as Akoranga Construction Limited, ran numerous advertisements in local papers falsely claiming to be an LBP. He also displayed the LBP logo on his business card, despite never holding such a licence, and pretended to be an LBP when engaged to carry out building work.
An Orewa homeowner responded to one of these print advertisements and engaged Mr Cole to replace a number of piles under the deck of her house. He undertook this work, continuing the guise of a licensed builder. The homeowner paid Mr Cole for the job, which remains unfinished.
Building Act offence
It is an offence under the Building Act 2004 for a person to claim to be licensed to carry out or supervise restricted building work, while not being licensed.
“The prosecution sends a clear message to the building industry that claiming to be a licensed building practitioner without actually holding such a licence is illegal,” said Mr Thomas.
Mr Cole pleaded guilty to both charges, was fined $5000, and ordered to pay court fees and $1296.02 in reparation to the homeowner for the unfinished work on her home.
The message is clear
“This prosecution should serve as an important reminder to tradespeople that they can only promote themselves as LBPs if they are a Licensed Building Practitioner,” says LBP registrar Paul Hobbs.
“Where MBIE has evidence of anyone operating outside of the law, they can expect to be caught and prosecuted accordingly.”
How to make a complaint
The non-LBP complaint process is a little different to the LBP process.
If restricted building work has been done by someone who is not an LBP, you need to complain to our Occupational Licensing Team (OLT). Your complaint should relate to one or more of the following:
A person has undertaken restricted building work without being licensed or supervised by a licensed person.
A person held themselves out to hold a licence when they were not licensed.
A person engaged another person to carry out or supervise restricted building work and knew the other person was not licensed.
This does not apply to owner-builders who have applied for an owner-builder exemption for restricted building work.
The OLT may prosecute a building practitioner if they:
Hold themselves out to be a licensed building practitioner when they are not.
Undertake restricted building work while not appropriately licensed or supervised.
Knowingly engage a non-licensed building practitioner to undertake restricted building work.
To complain, download and complete the RBW allegation form below and return it by email to investigations@mbie.govt.nz .
You could also talk to your council. In their capacity as a building consent authority they:
Can issue an infringement notice for $750 to a person who carries out restricted building work while unlicensed, inappropriately licensed or unsupervised.
Should refuse to issue a building consent for proposed restricted building work (RBW) if the consent application is not accompanied by a valid certificate of design work.
Can issue the owner, the building consent holder or both with a ‘notice to fix’ to stop any further building work if an application does not identify the LBPs who are to carry out restricted building work.
Find your council’s contact details on the local council’s website.

Have your say on NZ building laws!
MBIE is proposing major changes to our building laws to improve the quality of building work – these are the most significant reforms since the current Building Act was introduced in 2004
An efficient building regulatory system isn’t the sole responsibility of government. Everyone in the sector must work together to lift the level of quality, so things go right the first time – and, if  they do go wrong, there are fairer outcomes.
Why reforms are needed
The building sector faces a number of long-standing problems. These problems range from low productivity and inefficient practices and processes, to skills and labour shortages, to poor health and safety. We’ve talked to people across the sector about problems with how the regulatory system functions. Our conversations revealed three common themes:
Roles and responsibilities are not clear.
Information isn’t available when it’s needed.
It’s difficult to hold people to account for the quality of their  work.
What’s in the reforms package?
These are the most significant reforms since the current Building Act was introduced in 2004. They affect people, products and practices across the sector. The proposals are summarised below. There are more details about these proposals in the full discussion paper and summaries of each part.
Building products and methods
Clarify roles and responsibilities for building products and methods.
Require manufacturers and suppliers to provide information about building products.
Strengthen the framework for product certification.
Make consenting easier for modern methods of construction including off-site manufacturing.
Occupational regulation
Change the licensed building practitioners scheme:
Introduce a tiered licensing system for LBPs to establish a progression pathway, including a specific licence for supervision.
Simplify the licence class categories.
Introduce behavioural competence requirements for LBPs.
Raise the competence standards and broaden the definition of Restricted Building Work.
Introduce a new licensing scheme for engineers and restrict who can carry out safety-critical engineering work.
Remove exemptions that allow unlicensed people to carry out plumbing, gasfitting and drainlaying work.
Risk and liability
Require a guarantee and insurance product for residential new builds and significant alterations, and allow homeowners to actively opt out of it.
Leave the liability settings for building consent authorities unchanged.
Building levy
Reduce the building levy from $2.01 including GST to $1.50 including GST (per $1,000).
Standardise the building levy threshold at $20,444 including GST.
Allow MBIE to spend funds raised by the building levy on broader stewardship of the building sector.
Offences, penalties and public notification
Increase the maximum financial penalties.
Set different maximum penalties for individuals and organisations.
Extend the time enforcement agencies can lay a charge from six months to 12 months.
Modify the definition of ‘publicly notify’ in section 7 of the Building Act.
Have your say! Submissions close on 16 June 2019
MBIE will use the information from the submissions to refine its proposals. The Minister for Building and Construction will then decide what changes to recommend to Cabinet.

Getting work done correctly the first time is an efficient way of meeting deadlines, budgets and standards. It is also one of the reasons the licensing regime was introduced
By having LBPs, consumers can have the confidence that their homes will be built right the first time, because LBPs should have the necessary skills and capability to build correctly and resolve any issues as they arise.
Defence 1 – ‘Unfinished’ work
The Building Practitioners Board (the Board) deals with a lot of complaints where LBPs did not get it right first time. Instead, they have been ignorant of the issues, or have chosen to ignore them, and have moved on with the building process. Often the LBP’s defence is that the work was not finished, and that the LBP was going to return and remediate the non-compliant or substandard building work.
Sometimes this is acceptable, such as where a snag list is generated relating to minor items. Mistakes are made and not all mistakes should lead to an LBP being disciplined. However, when there are major quality issues or non-compliance, which should not have occurred, then a disciplinary outcome may be appropriate.
When an LBP claims “it’s not finished” as a defence, the Board will look at the sequencing of the work to assess if there is any merit to what they are saying. If deconstruction is required to remediate the problem, or the costs involved in bringing the build up to standard are greater than they would have been by doing it right the first time, then the defence is difficult to accept.
The Board also looks at whether the LBP had a process to identify and deal with such issues during the build. If there is a quality assurance system in place, the “it’s not finished” defence can hold weight. However, if the LBP was unaware of the issues, or they have had to be brought to their attention by others, then it is unlikely the Board will accept it.
This is especially the case when it is a building consent authority (BCA) that is noting non-compliance at inspections. In one complaint (Zahid Ali – C2-01592) there were repeated inspection failures, often for the same issues, over multiple sites. The Board noted that the BCA’s role is to check that the building work has been carried out in accordance with the building consent. It is not to instruct or give direction on how compliance can be achieved. The Board expects an LBP to have the necessary knowledge and skills to carry out routine building work in a compliant manner, without requiring such assistance.
Defence 2 – Compliance provided
A similar defence the Board often hears is “but the council gave it a pass”. There are various things the Board considers in this situation. Was it a case of eventually getting it right after multiple failures, as in the Ali case? Did the BCA miss a non-compliance issue and pass building work that was not compliant? If this is the case, should the non-compliance have been apparent to the LBP? If the Board considers the LBP should have identified or been aware of the non-compliance, then the LBP might be open to being disciplined.
Getting a pass from a BCA does not absolve an LBP from accountability for non-compliant work. LBPs should also note that BCAs are only looking at compliance; they do not check the quality of the work. Compliant work can still be substandard, especially where there is evidence of poor workmanship. Therefore, an LBP can still be disciplined for building work that is substandard, even if it meets the minimum requirements for compliance.
Licensing was brought in to improve standards and accountability. LBPs should have the skills and knowledge to get the job done correctly – so, if they botch a job, they should be held to account for their negligence or incompetence.
Getting it right the first time, and having a quality assurance system to catch minor mistakes, is the best way to avoid the complaints process. It is also better business practice, as it helps to keep builds within budget, on schedule and up to standard, which in turn leads to satisfied customers and a more prosperous economy for all.
This article is an excerpt from Codewords Issue 96. Reading Codewords articles that are relevant to your licence class is a mandatory requirement for Licensed Building Practitioners.

Part 1 of this series covered off the basics of exempt building work and some of the easy to measure exemptions. Part 2 will go into a few of the more complex exemptions.
As a brief recap, all building work requires a building
consent, except for work covered by Schedule 1 of the Building Act 2004.
Schedule 1 lists the building work that is exempt from needing a building
consent. MBIE has issued guidance on Schedule 1 with helpful and practical
examples – you can find the guidance on MBIE’s Building
Performance website .
Don’t forget to check if you need a building consent. This
will help you avoid fines from councils or penalties from the Building
Practitioners Board. You can check by reading the above guidance and contacting
your local building consent authority.
Exemption 8 – Windows
and exterior doorways in existing dwellings and outbuildings
All work in connection with a window (including a roof
window) or exterior doorway in an existing dwelling or outbuilding of not more
than two storeys in height is exempt work.
However, if you are replacing a window or doorway, that item
must not have failed its durability test under clause B2 of the Building Code.
Based on the current Building Code, this means that the existing item that is
being replaced must have satisfied the 15-year durability requirement.
If the item has rotted and needs replacing within 15 years
of installation, or if the building work modifies a specified system (such as installing
a roof window and repositioning a sprinkler head) then you will need to get a
building consent.
This exemption covers structural and/or weather tightness
work as long as the purpose of that work is to install the window or exterior
doorway.
Exemption 11 – Internal
walls and doorways in existing building
Changing an internal wall or doorway is exempt building work
unless the wall is:
load bearing
a bracing element
a firewall (ie a barrier designed to limit the
spread of fire, heat and structural collapse)
part of a specified system (such as electromagnetic
or automatic doors)
made of ‘units’ of materials stacked or bonded
together with mortar (like bricks or blocks).
Exemption 12 – Internal
linings and finishes in existing dwelling
You can replace any interior linings without using
comparable materials in an existing dwelling without needing a building consent.
Interior linings could be part of bracing or fire resistant
elements, so we suggest investigating and installing the appropriate type of replacement
lining.
Exemption 13 – Thermal
insulation
You don’t need a building consent to install thermal
insulation in an existing building unless you are installing it in an exterior
wall or an interior firewall.
Installing insulation in ceilings, floors and interior walls
that are not firewalls are examples of exempt work.
Under the Residential Tenancy Act, ceiling and underfloor insulation will be compulsory in all rental homes from 1 July 2019. You can read more about this requirement on the Tenancy website .
Exemption 14 – Penetrations
For detached dwellings of any height and dwellings within a
building that is not more than three storeys high:
Penetrations can be made that are 300mm or less
in diameter without a building consent. The exemption includes any associated
building work like weatherproofing or fireproofing.
For
outbuildings that are detached and not more than three storeys high:
Penetrations can be made that are 300mm or less
in diameter without a building consent. The exemption includes any associated
building work like weatherproofing or fireproofing.
For
all other buildings:
Penetrations can be made that are 300mm or less
in diameter without a building consent as long as doing so does not modify of
affect: the primary structure Any specified system
the primary structure
Any specified system
The exemption includes any associated building work like
weatherproofing or fireproofing.
For any other scenario (such as a commercial building), creating a penetration not exceeding 300mm in diameter is still exempt building work if the work does not affect the primary structure or a specified system (such as a fire suppression system).
Exemption 35 – Alteration
to existing sanitary plumbing (excluding water heaters)
Alterations to sanitary plumbing fixtures (baths, showers,
basins, etc) are exempt from building consent requirements as long as you are
not increasing the number of fixtures in the building and the alteration does
not affect a specified system (such as fire sprinklers).
This work must be done by an authorised person (see page 79
of MBIE’s guidance). It also excludes work for water heaters (although this
work may be covered by other exemptions).
Next time…
The next article in our Exempt Building Work series will cover off the trickiest exemptions you’re likely to encounter. Stay tuned.

Building Practitioners Board cancels carpentry LBP’s licence due to serious negligence and incompetence
C ase number C2-01409 relates to Grant Tromp*, an LBP licensed in carpentry, who was contracted by a homeowner to carry out alterations and to build an extension on an existing house. Mr Tromp did not obtain a building consent for the work and failed to carry out the building work to an appropriate standard, resulting in him being disciplined and his licence cancelled.
The Board upheld two grounds for discipline:
Negligence or incompetence – failing to comply with building consent requirements, and building work.
Working outside one’s competence.
Negligence or incompetence – failing to comply with building consent requirements
Mr Tromp was initially engaged under a ‘design and build’ contract to carry out renovations to a kitchen area. According to Mr Tromp, he thought Schedule 1 of the Building Act 2004 (building work that does not require a building consent) applied to the work, so did not think a building consent was required. Mr Tromp subsequently provided the homeowner with other concept plans and was then also engaged to extend and enclose an existing porch into a new room.
However, a building consent was required for the kitchen renovation, because the hot water cylinder and associated plumbing work was not exempt under Schedule 1 (see page 89 of the ‘Building work that does not require a building consent’ guidance). The extension and porch enclosure also required a building consent, because it was also not covered by any of the exemptions in Schedule 1 (see page 50 of the guidance).
The Board found that Mr Tromp was negligent in that he did not obtain a building consent for this work as required under the Building Act 2004.
Negligence or incompetence – building work
In addition to the lack of building consent, the Board found that Mr Tromp had also been negligent with respect to the work he carried out and that Mr Tromp failed to comply with both the Building Code and NZS 3604:2011 (the relevant standard).
There were significant shortcomings with the flashing and joinery installation, which was not weathertight. Sill flashings had been left out and only sealant had been used to waterproof cladding junctions. The roof framing and subfloor framing construction were not within the scope of NZS 3604:2011 , because the spans used were too large for the framing members installed. An engineer should have been engaged, or different construction methods should have been used.
Working outside one’s competence
Mr Tromp was an LBP licensed in carpentry. He did not think the work required a building consent and, as such, he thought it was not restricted building work. He therefore undertook the design as well. He said he purposely designed the extension and enclosure of the porch to fit within Schedule 1. Mr Tromp did not draw his construction details from Acceptable Solutions or other tried and tested construction methods and the design and construction details he used did not comply with the Building Code.
Ultimately, the Board found that he worked outside his competence when he carried out the design work. A competent designer would have ensured better construction design and elements were used in the extension and would have identified that building consent was required for the work undertaken.
What can LBPs learn from this decision?
Failure to correctly interpret Schedule 1 was identified as an issue in the annual Building Practitioners Board report, and it was a major part of the process breakdown in this circumstance. If a building consent had been obtained, the compliance process would have identified the design deficiencies and they would have been corrected. As this decision clearly illustrates, carpenters and other trades should not take on the role of designer.
MBIE has produced guidance on Schedule 1 of the Building Act 2004 that is worth reading, if you are considering undertaking exempt building work. Remember – if you are in doubt as to whether the intended building work will come within Schedule 1 or not, it is best to seek advice from an authoritative source.
*Due to the seriousness of the matter, the Board has chosen to name the LBP

Building Practitioners Board annual report released
E ach year, the Building Practitioners Board is required to release an annual report providing an overview of its activities for the year. The past year has seen a continuation of increased activity for the Board, especially around dealing with complaints received by the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment.
At the time of the report’s publication, the scheme had 29,145 licences issued to 24,151 individuals (the discrepancy represents those LBPs who have more than one licence). In the 2014/2015 financial year, 1,700 new licences were granted.
Increasing complaints
According to the report, the number of complaints received by the Board has increased about 40% in the past year, likely due to increasing consumer awareness of the programme and increased residential construction activity.
In relation to LBP complaints, the Board identified a number of common themes:
Records of Work being withheld by LBPs.
Not building in accordance with a building consent, or without a building consent, or with an amended building consent.
Failing to properly ‘supervise’ building work.
Designers not having an adequate understanding of the consent process and their obligations for plans and specifications to meet the Building Code.
Determinations on all these issues have been and continue to be made by the Board. The Board is encouraging LBPs to read these decisions so they can better understand how to avoid complaints in these areas.
“These decisions make it very clear what is expected by the Board in terms of compliance and standards,” said David Clarke, chairman at the time of the report. “It is disappointing to note that, for a few practitioners, the message is not getting through.
“The Registrar has provided advice and set guidelines through publications such as Codewords on these topics and it is important that the message is understood and compliance is met by the industry. Further non-compliance will only result in the Board adopting a very firm line against offending in these areas.”
High level of misunderstanding
The Board found that a number of complaints stemmed from LBPs not having a good enough grasp of the regulatory rules they are required to comply with, as well as a lack of understanding around individual responsibility and accountability. These issues, combined with a tendency to proceed with work even when in doubt about its compliance, have led to a number of complaints.
Complaints in numbers
One of the Board’s targets was to hear and/or determine 80% of complaints within eight months of them being referred to the Board or receipt of the Registrar’s Report. However, due to the unprecedented increase in complaints, the Board only dealt with 75% within measure. The remaining 25% were dealt with in more than eight months.
Not all of these complaints were upheld – the table below illustrates how the complaints were resolved.
In total, 35 LBPs were disciplined, three of whom had more than one complaint laid against them. Complaints were upheld in each class and the proportion of LBPs disciplined closely reflected the overall number of LBPs in that licence class.
Auckland accounted for almost 50% of complaints, in proportion with the amount of residential building activity going on there. All decisions can be viewed at www.lbp.govt.nz .

Life is unpredictable and sometimes a serious life event can turn your world upside down and affect your ability to work
A break from work can happen due to circumstances outside your control, and you may not always know how long you will be off work for. An accident or serious medical condition can keep you off the tools for months or even years, or family commitments might take you overseas, or out of the building industry for a time.
Managing your Licensed Building Practitioner (LBP) licence may be the last thing on your mind, but the process may be simpler than you think. If you intend to return to working as an LBP, or want to keep your options open, it is highly recommended that you voluntarily suspend your licence to make it easier to return to carrying out restricted building work (RBW) at a later date. This will also reduce costs compared to maintaining a licence during the time you’re not using it.
Putting your licence on voluntary suspension
You may request for your licence (or classes of licence) to be suspended for up to two years. While your licence is suspended, you cannot carry out or supervise RBW; however, you are relieved from paying relicensing fees to maintain your licence. The public register will list your licence as suspended ‘at the request of the practitioner’, so while others know you are not licensed to work, clients will also know the suspension was not imposed by the Building Practitioners Board (the Board) or Registrar for disciplinary reasons.
To request voluntary suspension, go to the LBP website and fill in the ‘Voluntary suspension of licence’ form. You will need to:
Submit the completed form at least ten working days before your elected suspension start date.
Pay the required fee of $50.00.
Why not just let your licence lapse?
If you do not renew your licence it will automatically become suspended for a year before it is cancelled (unless you relicense within that year). This may suit some people who will be returning to work in a month or two. There are a few downsides though to letting your licence suspend automatically rather than voluntarily, including:
When you relicense, your relicensing date doesn’t change, so you will effectively still be paying to be licensed while suspended.
The suspension on the public register will be listed as ‘Failure to comply with the conditions of licensing’ and indicate you have fees owing.
If it turns out you need more time off work, you may have to relicense before you want to return to work or risk having your licence cancelled and having to reapply.
Maintaining your skills maintenance
You will need to continue to maintain your skills while your licence is suspended by completing your required skills maintenance. Keeping up with your skills maintenance is a licensing requirement, but is also a good way to keep your knowledge up to date for when you do return to work.
While on voluntary suspension, you will still have access to the LBP online portal to add your skills maintenance activities. It is best to try and do some activities before you intend to return to work, so you don’t have too much catching up to do when you apply to end your voluntary suspension. Reading Codewords and doing some elective activities may be achievable while recuperating or being away from the construction site. On-the-job learning may be more challenging to complete, and could require a bit of planning.
If it is less than two years since your last skills maintenance round, you may not need to have completed all your skills maintenance before getting your licence back. The licensing team will be able to assist you if you are unsure of your requirements.
Returning to work
You can revive your voluntarily suspended licence at any time by completing the ‘End of voluntary suspension of licence’ form on the LBP website. Once your request is received, you will be contacted to advise you of your requirements for uplifting your suspension. Requirements might include:
Paying all or some of a relicensing fee.
Providing evidence of your skills maintenance activities while you have been on voluntary suspension.
Common mistakes
Sometimes LBPs contact the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) after their licence has been suspended or cancelled and ask to put their licence on hold. They may have been off work for months, but just haven’t thought about their licence until they received the letter notifying them that it is no longer active. However, to put a licence on voluntary suspension, it needs to be active. Therefore, if your licence has been suspended because you did not renew on time, you may have to relicense before you can start a voluntary suspension, which can be a hassle.
It is much easier for you and the licensing team if you simply get in  touch while your licence is still active.  A voluntary suspension is cost effective, and can be lifted whenever you want within the two-year period. This gives you flexibility if you are not sure when you will be coming back.

S everal hundred builders from throughout the country attended PlaceMakers’ fourth round of skills maintenance seminars to reinforce their knowledge around Restricted Building Work (RBW) and Records of Work (ROW).
“More than a year after RBW and ROW were introduced, many Licensed Building Practitioners (LBPs) are still getting accustomed to the process and a significant number have yet to fill in their first ROW form,” says presenter Paul Alsford.
“The excellent seminar turnouts, and the number of questions asked, demonstrate these LBPs are keen to get ROW right.”
The seminars provided a great refresher for the LBPs who attended, including information on what should be in the ROW form and some tips on how to manage this elevated level of compliance and paperwork.
“ROW is a document specifically for LBPs,” says Paul. “Including the right level of detail is important when filling it in for two reasons – it will be on the property file for the life of the building and it’s evidence of who did what work.”
Paul adds that it’s key to remember that every LBP on the job – whether undertaking or supervising RBW – is required to fill in the ROW.
“Another thing to think about is whether you are acting as the owner’s agent, as it will likely be part of your responsibility to collect all ROW forms from the involved LBPs. This means getting them before that guy leaves the job for the next one!”
Seminar attendees said having the senior building officials on hand to answer more specific questions was particularly helpful.
The sessions also touched on other areas, including determinations and work that doesn’t require a building consent. Make sure to download a copy of MBIE’s guideline on work not requiring a building consent at www.dbh.govt.nz/bc-no-consent .
To learn more about determinations visit www.dbh.govt.nz/determinations .
If you’re discussing building work that does not require a building consent with the building owner, make sure they know most councils still allow details of the work to be put on the property file. Having a thorough record of all building work done on a building or house is often a key to selling later on.

MBIE’s tolerances guidance aims to resolve common areas of dispute between contractors and homeowners
T he Guide to tolerances, materials and workmanship in new residential construction, prepared by the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE), aims to assist contractors and homeowners who may be unsure of what constitutes a defect within the Building Act 2004.
This guide focuses on issues that can lead to disputes between building contractors and homeowners, but which fall outside the Building Code, contract documentation and manufacturers’ specifications and installation instructions. It outlines what constitutes acceptable levels of workmanship in standard domestic construction types under normal conditions and is targeted at new residential building work.
Consumer protection measures
The guidance was written with advice from the industry and supports the new consumer protection measures in Part 4A of the Building Act, which came into law on 1 January 2015.
Under the new consumer protection measures, a 12-month defect repair period starts from:
the completion of the building work under a written contract, or
the completion of the physical building work, in cases where there is no written contract.
During this time, it is the main contractor’s responsibility to fix any defects, or prove that any defective building work is through no fault of their own, the subcontractors under their control, or the products supplied if there is a dispute.
What’s covered?
The Guide to tolerances, materials and workmanship in new residential construction covers mainly aesthetic issues (eg, what is considered a reasonable slope in a floor, or what is an acceptable appearance for a newly painted wall) in new builds and additions at any price, whether or not the consumer protection measures and $30,000 threshold apply.
The guide does not cover tolerances for repairs, renovations, or alterations within existing buildings. Tolerances for existing buildings are likely to be below those achievable with new buildings. There are a number of reasons for this, including the nature of the materials used in existing buildings and the effects of both time and natural events.
It is also a great tool to make sure clients understand and agree what acceptable levels of tolerances, materials and workmanship are for new residential building work. It can be used before contracts are signed, to help align expectations of quality with choice of design, materials, finishes and costs.
The Guide to tolerances, materials and workmanship in new residential construction is not a mandatory set of standards. Contractors and clients can mutually agree to their own expectations, preferably within their written contract.
Roof cladding – what’s acceptable?
A common cause of damage to roof claddings is foot traffic. This type of damage is the main contractor’s responsibility if the damage occurred during work done as part of the contract. It is not the main contractor’s responsibility if the damage was caused by trades or persons that do not fall under their contractual control.
The normal viewing position distance for roofs, guttering, downpipes and roof vents, is ≥3m. The table below outlines the tolerances for pressed metal roof tiles:

Design, engineering and quantity surveying work now included under scope of the Act
T he Construction Contracts Act 2002, which covers both commercial and residential construction contracts, provides a process for dealing with payments and disputes under a construction contract.
In December last year, the Construction Contracts Amendment Act 2015 was passed, amending the Act in three areas in a staged process:
Removing the differences between residential and commercial contracts (changed 1 Dec 2015).
Design, engineering and quantity surveying work to be included in the Act (from 1 September 2016).
Retention money withheld under commercial construction contracts must be held on trust (from 31 March 2017).
1) Removing the differences between residential and commercial contracts
From 1 December 2015, parties to residential construction contracts have full access to the Act’s dispute resolution and payment regimes. This builds on the changes to the Building Act 2004 that came into effect on 1 January 2015, requiring residential building work over $30,000 in value to be covered by written contracts. Contractors continue to be unable to obtain charging orders against residential occupiers.
2) Design, engineering and quantity surveying work included in the Act
From 1 September 2016, the scope of the Construction Contracts Act 2002 is widened to include construction-related services, such as work done by architects, engineers and quantity surveyors. These professions will now be able to access the payment and dispute resolution processes in the Act. Meanwhile, their clients will have greater means to hold architects, engineers and quantity surveyors to account for their work.
Before the Act was introduced in 2002, professional organisations for engineers and architects successfully lobbied to be excluded on the basis that the relationship between clients and consultants differed from the relationship between clients and contractors.
However, MBIE has decided that the difference no longer justifies excluding consultants from the scope of the Act, despite receiving opposing submissions from organisations such as the New Zealand Institute of Architects (NZIA) and the Institution of Professional Engineers New Zealand. Previously, consultancy contracts governed relationships between consultants and clients.
Including construction-related services in CCA will be beneficial for consumers who have a dispute involving building contractors and designers, engineers or quantity surveyors, as they will not need to initiate different dispute resolution processes against each party. This should reduce costs and increase consistency of outcomes.
3) Retention money withheld under commercial construction contracts must be held on trust
The new law requires that retention money for commercial contracts be held on trust, protecting it in the event of a business failure.
Under the old law, retention payments were often not held on trust and were put at risk by being used as working capital. In the event of a company going bust, subcontractors lost the retention owed to them.
From 31 March 2017, this trust obligation will apply to all retention money over a yet-to-be-determined minimum amount that will be prescribed in regulations. This will drive better business practices without excessive compliance costs.
Retention money is an amount withheld by a party to a construction contract (the payer) from an amount payable to another of the contract’s parties (the payee) as performance security, which can be used to pay for any remedial action that may need to be done as a result of faulty work. They are used regularly in commercial construction contracts and, while allowable, seldom in residential construction contracts.
The Amendment Act makes the trust requirement clear for parties to commercial construction contracts – the payer will be required to hold retention money on trust in the form of cash or other liquid assets, such as accounts receivable.
Payers will have to ensure they pay the full amount of retentions when they are due under the contract, or else they could be found in breach of the trust.
Amendments explained
The changes are the result of a comprehensive review of the Construction Contracts Act 2002.
The amendments ensure the Act provides:
A fair, balanced and appropriate payment regime.
Access to fast and cost-effective dispute resolution.
Cost-effective and timely enforcement of rights and obligations.
Better certainty of payment of retention money held under construction contracts.
Further information on the Amendment Act and retentions is available on the MBIE website www.business.govt.nz

Business.govt.nz has refreshed its Employment Agreement Builder to help employers more easily create legally compliant and business-specific contracts
H aving suitable, up-to-date employment agreements in place is key to running a successful business, so the Business.govt.nz Employment Agreement Builder (EAB) has been refreshed to ensure it is doing the best job possible.
EAB has proven popular with employers since it launched in 2010, but there was room for improvement to make it easier to understand and more relevant for small businesses.
Business.govt.nz worked with a number of groups to refresh EAB, including Immigration NZ, Employment NZ, the Intellectual Property Office of NZ, Council of Trade Unions, WorkSafe and Inland Revenue.
The department also talked to small businesses and tested concepts with them throughout the tool’s development. Its aim was to provide small businesses with an easy-to-use and legally up-to-date way to create and manage employment agreements.
How it works
EAB allows employers to build an employment agreement relevant to their business and staff.
The tool identifies clauses that are mandatory, voluntary or recommended and where they are appropriate to use. Help text and tips throughout the process makes this legally complex process much easier.
Once an employment agreement is finished, the employer is sent the agreement along with a summary of tips specific to the agreement, a check list of practical things which could be done before a new employee starts and a sample offer letter.
Having a suitable, up-to-date employment agreement in place means employers can get on with the job of running their business and feel confident they are doing the right thing by law, the right thing by their employees and that they are covered if there are any problems.
Employment Agreement Builder (EAB) – FAQs
1. Why have you developed a new EAB tool?
By law, all employees must have a written employment agreement. We developed the new EAB tool to make it easy for small businesses to create legally compliant employment agreements tailored to the needs of their business.
2. Who has contributed to the development of EAB?
We’ve worked closely with a large number of groups including Immigration NZ, Employment NZ, IPONZ, Council of Trade Unions, WorkSafe and Inland Revenue to develop EAB’s content.
3. How will the content be kept up to date?
Business.govt.nz will continue to work closely with Employment NZ and MBIE Policy as new employment laws are developed and ensure EAB is kept updated.
4. How will you alert users to law changes that affect employment agreements they have created using the new EAB?
We will discuss any law changes that affect EAB in our monthly newsletter. We encourage users to subscribe to the Business.govt.nz newsletter when they create their agreements.
5. What happens if I’ve saved an incomplete agreement in EAB and the content is updated?
The changes will be automatically applied to the agreement if needed and the user will be alerted when they return to complete the agreement that the updates were made.
6. Who is the tool designed for?
EAB is designed primarily for small businesses with employees. Because the tool also features guidance material explaining its clauses, it can also be used by employees to learn about employment agreements and check specific clauses in their agreements.
7. How do I find EAB?
The tool is available at: https://eab.business.govt.nz
8. What devices can I use EAB on?
EAB is designed for use on desktop computers, tablets and smartphones.
9. Does the tool contribute to the Better for Business Programme?
Yes. EAB supports and contributes to the Better for Business programme making it easier for business customers to deal with government.
10. What is Business.govt.nz ?
Business.govt.nz is the government website for small businesses. The site makes it quicker and easier for small business to interact with government.
EAB delivers to Business.govt.nz’s vision to be a bridge between business and government – enabling businesses to learn about their legal rights and obligations, maximise government information and services, and to meet those obligations.

There is still some confusion around the Site licence, and what the Site licence holder’s responsibilities are onsite
T he Site licence class is a critical part of the Licensed Building Practitioner (LBP) scheme. Holders of a Site licence are practitioners who are recognised as possessing specific skills that relate to the oversight, coordination, organisation, and, in some cases, the management, of building projects. The Site licence is an indicator that a practitioner has the skills to manage personnel and provide technical site supervision within the scope of their licence. A practitioner with a Site licence can supervise general building work but not Restricted Building Work (RBW).
What is supervision?
If you are providing control, instruction or direction to others who are carrying out building work, or those working in other restricted areas, you are supervising them. Being a supervisor means you are responsible for making sure that the work is done competently and correctly to the relevant building consent. Where there is no building consent required, the building work must still meet the Building Code.
An important point to remember is that even if the work an LBP is supervising is not RBW, they may still be held accountable by the Building Practitioners Board for issues they are responsible for. This includes a Site licence holder.
The Licensed Building Practitioner Rules
Schedule 1 of the LBP Rules sets out the competencies that make up the minimum standards for each licence class, and the performance indicators that the Registrar will have regard to when determining whether a competency has been met. An applicant for an LBP licence will need to demonstrate competence in each of these competencies in the licence class they are applying for. The Rules can be found at: www.lbp.govt.nz/assets/lbp/documents/lbp-rules-2007.pdf
One way the Site licence class differs from trade licence classes is that the last competency in the Site licence class is about providing technical supervision rather than carrying out work. In trade licence classes such as bricklaying and blocklaying, carpentry, external plastering, foundations, and roofing, the last competency is instead about carrying out the work related to that licence class.
Who can supervise RBW?
Only LBPs can carry out or supervise RBW, and they can only supervise work which they are licensed to carry out themselves. Site licence holders are not licensed to carry out building work, therefore they cannot supervise RBW, or issue records of work. Check out the link for further information: www.lbp.govt.nz/assets/lbp/documents/Practice-note-supervision.pdf
As stated above, Site licence holders can supervise general building work. They may also carry out RBW like any non-licensed person if they are supervised by an LBP with the appropriate licence.
Site areas of practice
The three areas of practice (AOP) within the Site licence class can also be an area of confusion.
Site 1 AOP is the coordination and oversight of Category 1 buildings.
Site 2 AOP is the coordination and oversight of Category 1, 2 and 3 buildings.
Site 3 AOP is the management of Category 1, 2 and 3 building projects.
Apart from the differences in envelope complexity between site 1 and 2 (explained below under Categories of buildings), the main difference between the three areas of practice is that the site 3 licence holder manages the project and the technical supervision staff on what are usually large commercial projects. The staff could include one or more AOP 2 Site licence holders who would carry out the coordination and oversight of the on-site construction.
Categories of buildings The categories of buildings are found in the Schedule of the following Order:
Category 1 is a sleeping single home, with a risk matrix score that does not exceed 12. (More about the risk score can be seen in Part 4 of the Order, or in E2/AS1 of the building Code, but it essentially refers to the complexity of the weathertightness envelope.)
Category 2 buildings are defined as neither Category 1 or Category 3 buildings, therefore they are single homes where the risk score is greater than 12; or any other building (except for an ancillary building or an outbuilding) up to a height of 10m (the vertical distance between the upper surfaces of the building’s lowest and highest floors).
Category 3 buildings are not single home, and the building height exceeds 10m.
Restricted Building Work
RBW is defined as being the construction or alteration of the primary structure or the external moisture management system of a house or small-to-medium apartment building.
A small-to-medium apartment has a maximum height from the lowest point of the ground to the highest point of the roof of 10m.
This means that, as Category 3 buildings are not single home use and they’re over 10m in height (measured floor-to-floor), they do not contain RBW.
Further information regarding the above can be found on our website: www.lbp.govt.nz
This article is an excerpt from Codewords Issue 112. Reading Codewords articles that are relevant to your licence class is a mandatory requirement for Licensed Building Practitioners. These questions can be answered through the LBP portal, online on the Under Construction website or recorded on the magazine, then provided at the time of renewal.

A Canterbury LBP was stripped of his licence after it was found that he carried out building work in a negligent and incompetent manner, which was also likely to bring the regime into disrepute
In October 2021, the Building Practitioners Board (the Board) recorded its final decision in the matter of a complaint against Canterbury roofer Jamie Hartnett, BP123937, a trade-qualified licensed roofing practitioner in the profiled metal roof and wall cladding area of practice.
The Board viewed a wide range of evidence in relation to the case, including photos and videos of the work, a TVNZ article and even an episode of the TV show Fair Go. The hearing was undertaken ‘on the papers’ (ie, entirely on written submissions), and the initial draft decision was issued to the Complainant and Hartnett seeking further submissions. The Complainants responded with further submissions, Hartnett did not.
Offences under consideration Under section 317 Building Act 2004, which states the grounds for discipline of LBPs, the Board resolved to investigate Hartnett’s conduct in respect of:
Carrying out or supervising building work in a negligent or incompetent manner, and;
Conduct likely to bring the regime into disrepute.
There was also an additional issue around the need for a building consent for the work. Schedule 1 of the Building Act 2004 (work not requiring a building consent) allows for the comparable replacement of a component or assembly.
However, when replacing metal tiles with long run roofing – as was the case in this scenario – the fixing and support methods are very different, even though the weight may be similar. This means the question of whether it would constitute a ‘comparable’ replacement should have been further explored.
There was no evidence provided to show that Hartnett had made enquiries about whether a building consent was required, nor had he given the client advice that inquiries should be made with the local building consent authority (BCA).
The evidence Hartnett was engaged to install a replacement roof. The original decramastic tile roof, which had been badly damaged in a storm, was to be replaced with long run steel. The work was not carried out under a building consent.
The work was started by Hartnett but not finished and the Complainants raised workmanship issues regarding the quality of the work carried out. They contacted the Roofing Association of New Zealand and, after he saw the work, CEO Graham Moor stated that it was “well short of good trade practice and that there are compliance issues apparent as well”.
The remedial roofer engaged to finish the job also provided a report, highlighting the following issues:
Excessively scratched and dented roofing.
No transition flashings at the change of pitch.
Purlins installed at the bottom row and at the ridge and hips but not in-between and without valley purlins.
The iron was laid over, and fixed to, the original tile battens and underlay. Some new underlay had been installed.
Poorly finished ridging junctions.
“Appalling” sheeting at the chimney, with silicon used to prevent water ingress.
Damage to the roof was apparent due to the difference in thickness of the purlins and the tile battens.
Incorrect fixings had been used.
The remedial roofer’s report ended with this statement: “This roof has been left unrepairable and requires replacing. In my opinion, the contractor engaged to carry out the replacement of roof and gutter has little knowledge of roofing and should discontinue his services.”
A health and safety issue was also uncovered as there were no fall protection measures supplied, such as edge protection or scaffolding. Images supplied to the Board showed Hartnett standing on the roof with no means of protecting him from a fall. The Fair Go video clip also showed him on the edge of the roof with no means of protection or restraint being used.
Submissions to the interim draft report The Complainant brought further matters to the Board’s attention, namely that no contract had been provided for the work, which was over the $30,000 threshold for disclosure information and provision of a contract. There was also an alleged misappropriation of funds and misleading information given to the Complainants regarding the use of the funds provided.
The Board searched the Insolvency Register and found that Respondent was adjudicated as bankrupt in late 2019 and remains bankrupt, as well as being a sickness beneficiary. Under the Insolvency Act 2006, a bankrupt person must inform the Assignee of income and expenses, including any funds obtained over $1,300, and that it is an offence to obtain credit of more than $1,000.
The Complainants noted that, when they enquired at the roofing supplier, the flashings had been ordered but would not be made until they were paid for. Respondent said that all materials were paid for and he was waiting for them to be made.
Penalty, costs and publication As no further submissions were received from Hartnett, the Board confirmed that his licence is cancelled and cannot be re-applied for before the expiry of six months. He was ordered to pay $500 towards the costs, and incidental to, the Board’s inquiry. The Registrar is also to record the Board’s action in the Register of Licensed Building Practitioners and, in addition, the Board’s action will be publicly notified.
The full report, including photos, can be read on lbp.govt.nz under Complaints and Past Decisions using the keyword CB25691.

Bans, exemptions and extensions – Building Controls updates have it all. Read on to find out what changes have been made over the past two months
W hen it comes to building performance, MBIE’s role as the overarching regulator is to work with stakeholders to deliver fit-for-purpose, performance-based building regulation that protects the public’s safety and property, and helps lift the sector’s performance.
MBIE works with building practitioners, officials, consumers and other regulators to understand what matters to them, and ensure they understand their roles and responsibilities.
Its range of statutory responsibilities for building and housing includes administering New Zealand’s building legislation and working with other regulators whose legislation has an impact on the building sector.
As part of its role, MBIE also has to provide clear, effective guidelines, information, education and enforcement. This includes regular Building Controls updates, which are featured on the business.govt.nz website.
There have been a number of significant updates of late.
To ensure you’re across them all, we’ve put together a summary of changes made in the last two months:
Designing fire cells
On 4 July, MBIE issued a clarification on designing firecells for more than 1,000 people. A firecell is any space including a group of contiguous spaces on the same or different levels within a building, which is enclosed by any combination of fire separations, external walls, roofs and floors.
If you are designing a firecell to be occupied by more than 1,000 people, you need to comply with the requirements of Building Code clause C4.4, even though the number of occupants might be different at the time of any evacuation.
Clause C4.4 applies to any firecell with more than 1,000 people and:
Is not time dependent.
Cannot be varied during an evacuation.
Its requirements must be applied throughout the entire evacuation.
This is explained in the clause and cannot be overridden by the use of Verification Method C/VM2.
The Verification Method is a tool for justifying a fire engineering design solution and cannot be used to predict location of occupants in an evacuation.
Firecells with high occupant loads (more than 1,000 people) are at greater risk due to:
The total number of occupants.
Inefficiencies in an evacuation.
Longer escape times.
Exempt from consent
From 30 June, a change to building consent exemptions means that new carports, whether free-standing or attached, do not require a building consent form.
The exemption applies to free-standing or attached carports that are:
On ground level and;
No greater than 20m 2 .
This is a change to Schedule 1 of the Building Act, which contains a list of building work that does not require a building consent.
Carport requirements are set out in clause 18 (more commonly known as exemption 18) of Schedule 1, which was amended by the Building (Exempt Building Work) Order 2016. Previously, exemption 18 referred only to attached carports.
Foil insulation ban
The chief executive of MBIE has declared a ban, under section 26 of the Building Act 2004, on retrofitting or repairing foil insulation in residential buildings. It came into force on 1 July.
The ban is specifically on the following building methods:
The installation of foil insulation into residential buildings with an existing electrical installation (retrofitting foil insulation), and;
The repair of foil insulation in residential buildings with an existing electrical installation (e.g. stapling ripped or damaged foil back onto the floor joists of a building).
The risk with retrofitting foil insulation is that the person installing it could accidentally pierce a live electrical cable with the fasteners (e.g. staples or nails) they are using to attach the foil to the building structure. The foil, being metallic, conducts electricity and can become live if it comes into contact with live electrical wiring – potentially enlivening the entire underfloor of a building. To date, there have been five reported deaths in New Zealand caused by electrocution associated with foil insulation in a residential building, as well as one reported non-fatal electric shock.
The ban will remain in place until amended or revoked by the Ministry. It is an offence under the Building Act to breach a ban and anyone who breaches the ban may be liable to a fine of up to $200,000.
Anyone concerned about how to work around foil insulation should consult WorkSafe’s guidance or engage the services of a licensed electrical worker.
New system for managing earthquake-prone buildings
The law for managing earthquake-prone buildings is being changed to avoid a ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach. It addresses recommendations from the Canterbury Earthquakes Royal Commission and the findings of a comprehensive review by the government. It also reflects a number of public submissions on the proposed system.
The aim is to standardise the rules and processes that apply to earthquake-prone buildings nationally, while still taking into account seismicity around New Zealand. The system prioritises geographic areas (categorised as low, medium and high seismic risk), buildings and parts of buildings that pose the greatest risk, while retaining as much built heritage as possible.
Features of the new system include:
Clarifying the definition of an earthquake-prone building.
Establishing a national register of earthquake-prone buildings.
Issuing enhanced notices for such buildings.
These measures aim to improve public information and encourage owners to remediate their buildings.
The new Earthquake-Prone Building (EPB) methodology will enable territorial authorities to profile and identify potentially earthquake-prone buildings in their districts. Timeframes for this process and deadlines for building owners to remediate earthquake-prone buildings will be set relative to their location and level of seismic risk.
The legislation defines a new category of ‘priority buildings’ in high and medium seismic risk areas. Those buildings include certain education buildings, some hospital buildings and buildings used as emergency shelters and for emergency services.
They will need to be identified and remediated within half the timeframe of other earthquake-prone buildings.
MBIE is developing new regulations to support the implementation of the system. Public consultation on the final form of the new regulations and the EPB methodology will take place later this year.

The Government has made changes to retention money requirements to give subcontractors confidence that they will be paid the retention money they are owed, should a head contractor’s business fail
These changes are prescribed in the Construction Contracts (Retentions Money) Amendment Act 2023 (the Amendment Act) which was passed on 5 April 2023.
The Amendment Act aims to strengthen and clarify protection for subcontractors’ retention money and make it easier for subcontractors to access retention money without a court order, in the event of a company’s insolvency.
The Amendment Act builds on retention money provisions already in the Construction Contracts Act 2002. The provisions in the Construction Contracts Act were put in place to protect retention money owed to subcontractors in the event of a business failure, and to ensure retention money withheld under construction contracts was responsibly managed.
Key changes to retention money provisions
Many head contractors are already doing the right thing and are holding retention money aside appropriately. For these people, there will be very little change.
The changes will safeguard subcontractors’ retention money by:
Clarifying that retention money is automatically held on trust by the head contractor once the contract allows it to be withheld from the subcontractor.
Removing the ability to mix retention money with other money and assets.
Requiring that retention money held as cash also be held separately in a bank account with prescribed ledger accounts.
Compliance with retention money provisions
The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) now has the responsibility to provide information, education and guidance to the sector on the retention money regime. This allows MBIE to help businesses, companies and subcontractors understand what they are responsible for, and how to comply with the retention money provisions.
The Amendment Act introduces new offences and penalties and gives the Chief Executive of MBIE the power to investigate retention money offences and enforce penalties. There are new offences and penalties of up to $200,000 for companies and, in some cases, directors who fail to meet the new requirements, including:
Failure to comply with accounting, recording and reporting requirements.
Use of retention money for a purpose other than remedying defects in the subcontractor’s performance.
Failure to provide regular information to the subcontractor on retention money.
Date to start complying with the changes
The changes in the Amendment Act come into force on 5 October 2023. This gives time for head contractors looking to hold retention money, to ensure processes are established and standard contracts are renewed.
Where to find further information

Following a two-year transition period, Acceptable Solution B1/AS1 will no longer be used for foundations on land prone to liquefaction. Foundations will be consented as a Verification Method or Alternative Solution
New Zealand is a high earthquake hazard region, and earthquake considerations are integral to the design of the built environment. Liquefaction is a real risk to our built environment, especially to buildings, as it can result in settlement, tilting, stretching and damage to services and utilities.
WHAT IS LIQUEFACTION?
Liquefaction is when the strength and stiffness of a soil is reduced by earthquake shaking or other rapid loading. Three key elements are all required for this to occur:
Loose soil – typically sands and silts or, in rare cases, gravel.
Saturated soil – that is, below the ground water table.
Sufficient ground shaking – a combination of the earthquake duration and intensity of shaking.
WHAT ARE ITS EFFECTS?
In areas with soils that are susceptible to liquefaction, significant damage to structures and lifelines can be caused by liquefaction-related lateral spreading and lateral stretching.
Lateral spreading is the horizontal movement of ground towards the free face (open face) or downslope as a result of liquefaction of shallow underlying soil deposits.
Lateral stretching appears as ground cracks, which typically occur when the ground moves horizontally between two points over a given length.
LESSONS FROM CHRISTCHURCH
Widespread liquefaction in the Canterbury earthquakes has resulted in an extensive amount of research and guidance, developed locally and nationally, on past occurrence of and future vulnerability to liquefaction.
There is also a broad understanding of the effects and how to mitigate these. As a result of this awareness, buildings constructed after the earthquakes are to be built to the latest standards for liquefaction-prone land and will be more resilient than the older building stock.
BUILDING CODE CHANGE TO FOUNDATIONS
Traditional foundation solutions contained within B1/AS1 were found to perform poorly on ground that is susceptible to liquefaction and lateral spreading during an earthquake. Therefore, Acceptable Solution B1/AS1 will no longer be used on ground prone to liquefaction or lateral spreading. To implement this change, the current limits for ‘good ground’ in Building Code clause B1 Structure have been adjusted.
This change means that foundation solutions on land prone to liquefaction and/or lateral spreading will need to be consented as a Verification Method or Alternative Solution.
COST CONCERNS RAISED
Feedback from public consultation in August/September 2019 revealed that most of the building and construction sector believes that the change will increase the cost to build on liquefaction-susceptible land. However, this will be offset by a gradual increase in seismic resilience and a corresponding reduction in post-earthquake disruption to Kiwi homes.
Experience from the Canterbury rebuild also demonstrates that the engineered foundations, in time, are actually cheaper than conventional slab-on-ground foundations due to increased availability and changes in supply and demand.
Key outcomes of the change to liquefaction-prone ground requirements include:
Achieving greater resilience via appropriate initial geotechnical investigations.
Increasing sector efficiency through communication, collaboration and education.
Raising the awareness of the risk of liquefaction and its impact on land and buildings.
TWO-YEAR TRANSITION PERIOD
There is a two-year transition period for these changes, finishing 28 November 2021, giving everyone the opportunity to come up to speed with the requirements. During the transition, MBIE will run an awareness campaign (education and training) targeting the general sector and advising key stakeholders of Building Code updates.
Further information on the biannual Building Code updates programme is available at www.mbie.govt.nz/have-your-say, while the updated Acceptable Solutions and Verification Methods can be seen at www.building.govt.nz

The chairman of Master Brick and Blocklayers NZ shares his considerations for the toolbox meeting
As we are all aware, the last 12 months have been very challenging for all sectors of our economy and the construction industry is no exception. The mandates around the various Covid iterations have had a significant impact on all areas of the construction workplace.
The mental health impact of these Covid regulations needs to be given as much consideration as the regulations themselves. Licensed Building Practitioners should ensure it is discussed openly and regularly at toolbox meetings. Mental health has been part of the legislation for many years; however, it has often been sidelined over a focus on safety on site.
The importance of asking for help
Even as the make-up of the sector changes in a gender sense, a very blokey culture remains evident in many areas. The idea that it is a sign of weakness to ask for help when one is struggling to mentally cope with circumstances that are outside of their control still prevails with many.
Whether it’s staff shortages, consent delays, isolations, cash flow issues, cost rises, product shortages or transit delays, there isn’t a party in the sector who has not been impacted by many of these elements. The personal circumstances of many have resulted in one of the most challenging times in our history in respect to wellbeing.
I believe that it is not a sign of weakness to ask for help, whether it’s a colleague, friend, or professional adviser – it’s a sign of wisdom and strength. Giving your team and yourself permission to acknowledge that the current environment has impacted our sense of wellness and wellbeing needs to be front and centre of these discussions.
There are several organisations doing great work in this area, with the aim of supporting the construction sector to address these matters and show that it is “ok to not be ok”. Within the toolbox talk space, we need to foster a culture that reminds us to look out for our mates – at work, in the community and within our families. Many of the sector’s associations provide resources to their members that help in managing this critical element of our workplace.
Resources available to start the conversation
WorkSafe has several documents available to assist starting these conversations, including:
Starting the conversation about mental health.
Mental health when working from home, for PCBUs.
Improving Work-Related Health: Mentally Healthy Work.
Resources for maintaining mentally healthy work during Covid-19.
The industry has also been very proactive through the Mates in Construction programme, both here and in Australia. Taking responsibility for our industry’s needs sends a strong signal that this really does matter. Again, there are some excellent resources available that allow you to start a direct conversation which, to many, is a challenging thing to do.
Many industry partners are also providing space for these key messages to be delivered to you and your team.
Taking these steps is not, for want of a better term, “woke”. Case studies have shown a focus on health and wellbeing from an employer or PCBU leads to lower injury rates, thus less lost productivity as a result. Knowing that their wellbeing matters to the business makes a difference to how they approach their roles and those in a leadership position.
The key message to be remembered is that “it’s not a sign of weakness to ask for help, it is in fact a sign of wisdom”. Help is available – you only have to put your hand up and ask.
By Brian Miller – Chairman, Master Brick and Blocklayers NZ.

Is your brickwork up to scratch? Following a number of failed brick inspection reports, the Brick and Blocklayers Federation (BBFNZ) is looking to raise industry standards through the publication of a best practice guide
BBFNZ believes the residential bricklaying industry could improve its standards and avoid disputes, if bricklayers take more care in a few key areas.
Having reviewed a number of failed brick inspection reports, BBFNZ urges all bricklayers to:
Ensure they thoroughly read all consent documents before starting.
Check that the substrate has been prepared correctly and, if it hasn’t, don’t start work.
Make sure the cavity is adequate and clear.
“One of the key messages being given to the residential construction industry is to ‘build it right the first time’; however, easily avoidable mistakes are being made,” says BBFNZ CEO Melanie McIver. “These can add unnecessary stress to a build because they sometimes result in expensive and time-consuming remediation work.”
Ms McIver says initial observations of the data received show that this remediation work could range from something as simple as having the builder install a Window Association of New Zealand (WANZ) bar, to having to pull down the brickwork and re-clad.
In one example, an amendment was obtained to vary the brick veneer, but because it wasn’t read by the bricklayer, the wrong product was laid.
“When guys don’t read and follow the plan, they are forgetting that non-compliance with building consents is actually an offence under the Building Act,” she says. “It can lead to fines and disciplinary action by the Building Practitioners Board, as well as civil action.
“All it takes is being familiar with the consent documentation and, if necessary, appropriate standards before jumping into the work. Again, if the substrate isn’t right – don’t start work!”
Bricklayers aren’t responsible for sealing penetrations, but they are accountable for checking the substrate before they start working. They may also be held liable if they have covered up faulty building work. It’s worth getting the main contractor to sort any substrate issue before you start.
“Knowledge is knowing the components to make mortar, wisdom is knowing when they are properly mixed together
Bricklayers are also reminded that, unless the consenting documents state otherwise, cavity widths should be between 40–75mm and clear of mortar. While not mandatory, ‘washouts’ are good trade practice.
A ‘washout’ involves laying every corner, and every subsequent brick, at 800mm centres on a bed of sand. Once the veneer reaches 800mm high, these bricks are removed to facilitate the regular washing out of the mortar at the base of the cavity. Mortar should not encroach more than 5mm into the cavity.
BBFNZ is in the process of publishing a Best Practice Guide for Brick Veneer to assist the trade, by setting clear, acceptable work practices. It’s expected that the guide will also help set clear expectations of workmanship quality for the industry.
BBFNZ will be working with its local associations to help ensure members’ practices are compliant and to help them with any standards the federation may set for the industry.
“What we’re trying to build for our members is trade wisdom, rather than just trade knowledge,” says Ms McIver. “Knowledge is knowing the components to make mortar; wisdom is knowing when they are properly mixed together.”
Brick and blocklayers, and those who contract them, are urged to familiarise themselves with the new federation website: www.bbfnz.co.nz
BBFNZ also recommends building companies that regularly engage bricklayers to develop a relationship with their local association and that they make using federation-aligned brick and blocklayers standard practice.
Clear cavities are easier to achieve with washouts

TITLE   : LEARNINGS FROM BOARD COMPLAINTS

Annually, around 1% of Licensed Building Practitioners will have a complaint made against them. Anyone can make a complaint about an LBP to the Building Practitioner Board, who then investigate and determine the seriousness of the complaint and decide on any penalties following a hearing
A complaint can relate to building work (including design work) or poor behaviour related to building work. The Board cannot hear complaints regarding payment disputes, or commercial or contractual disputes, including employment disputes.
To be able to make a complaint about an LBP, you need to ensure that:
The person you are complaining about was an LBP when the conduct occurred.
The conduct you are complaining about is covered by one or more of the ‘grounds for discipline’ listed in section 317 of the Building Act 2004.
You can provide sufficient evidence to support your complaint.
Your complaint is made on the approved form.
There are a number of grounds for discipline, but the majority of complaints are in relation to a lack of supervision, poor workmanship, not building to the plans or bringing the LBP scheme into disrepute.
Defining supervision
An LBP is needed for the design, supervision, and the physical carrying-out of any restricted building work. For design work, supervision could mean undertaking a thorough check of the drawings and documents once they have been completed by a non-licensed person. But on-site, supervision means the work must be closely supervised while it is being carried out, to the extent that the LBP who is completing the Record of Work (ROW) is satisfied that the work has been completed as per the plans and to a good level of workmanship.
This can be difficult if you, as the LBP, are not onsite when the work is being carried out – best practice is being ‘proximate’ to the work. Of course, if you know the skill level of the person doing the work and have seen them carry out similar work in the past, then the supervision can be a bit less constant.
However, remember – if the work fails at some point in the future, your name is on the ROW. Why would you want to jeopardise your licence because someone else did not do their job properly? There is a Registrar’s practice note on supervision which can be found at lbp.govt.nz under ‘For LBPs’ to provide guidance on supervision.
Workmanship woes
Poor workmanship is not something any LBP ever wants to be accused of. LBPs should be proud to put their name to their work, as one of the principals of the scheme is ‘you have been assessed as being competent at your trade or profession‘.
However, workmanship is a hard thing to define. If unsure, one approach is to ask yourself ‘If someone had carried out work to that level of workmanship on my house, would I be happy to pay for it?’ A guide to tolerances, materials, and workmanship can be found at building.govt.nz by searching ‘guide to tolerances’.
Complaints about LBPs not following the plans, or using the Building Consent Authorities (BCA) as quality assurance (“You tell me what’s wrong, and I’ll make sure I fix it for you…”) are becoming more prevalent, and the penalties handed out to respondents who have been found guilty of doing so reflects the Board’s stance on this type of complaint.
Bringing the LBP scheme into disrepute stems mainly from communication issues – not answering calls from clients who may have an issue with something you have or have not done, arguing with the client, or not complying with a lawful request from the Board are among the cases that we are seeing.
Failing to supply a ROW
And last, but definitely not least, is failing to provide a ROW. The main excuse for not providing the ROW seems to be trying to use it as a lever to ensure the final payment is made.
Using a ROW in this manner is not acceptable LBP conduct. The ROW should always be completed and given to your client and the BCA as soon as possible after the restricted building work has been completed. The average fine being handed down for this offence is $1,500, along with $500 towards costs. So ask yourself, is it really worth $2,000 not to provide it?

These questions can be answered through the LBP portal, online on the Under Construction website or recorded on the magazine, then provided at the time of renewal.

Find out about the latest Building Code updates and how you can subscribe for the most up-to-date information
The Building Performance team at the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) updates the acceptable solution and verification method Building Code documents regularly. We do this to ensure that:
The system is effective and keeps pace with modern methods of construction, products and technologies.
Our buildings are safe, healthy and durable.
These changes have a direct impact on the work that Licensed Building Practitioners (LBPs) do. So, it’s really important that you find out about them as early as possible and get the opportunity to let us know what you think. When we are proposing changes to the Building Code regulations or to the acceptable solutions and verification methods, we run a consultation first. This is your chance to submit feedback on the proposed changes.
Summary of Building Code consultations
There have been a number of changes to get up to speed with recently. Here are some of the key points from the 2021 and 2022 updates that we want you to be aware of.
2022 Building Code updates
In 2022 we consulted on changes for:
Plumbing and drainage.
Protection from fire.
Structural stability of hollow-core floors.
You can read the proposal documents at: mbie.govt.nz/have-your-say/building-code-update-2022 .
This consultation closed on 1 July 2022 and received over 100 detailed submissions and comments.
The proposal that received the most interest was the changes to protection from fire for residential buildings. The plumbing and drainage proposals for lead in plumbing products and water temperatures also received a significant number of responses.
The Building Performance team have made decisions on two parts of the proposed changes to the Building Code – lead in plumbing products, and the structural stability of hollow-core floors.
By announcing these decisions prior to the publication of the revised acceptable solutions and verification methods, we aim to provide certainty and direction to the sector and give additional time to implement the required change.
Decision on hollow-core floors
The Building Performance team has removed the deemed to comply pathway in B1/VM1 for the design of the supports for hollow-core floor systems to minimise the chance of poorly designed systems being specified in new building work.
The amended Verification Method B1/VM1 will be published along with other documents in November 2023. This change for hollow-core floor systems will take immediate effect when published – there will be no additional transition period.
Decision on lead in plumbing products
The Building Performance team is amending Acceptable Solution G12/AS1 to limit the maximum allowable content of lead permitted in plumbing products. The transition period for this change will end on 1 September 2025. As the transition period extends to 2025, the revised acceptable solution will be published in alignment with the rest of the plumbing and drainage updates in November 2023.
Summary of decisions on lead in plumbing products and hollow-core floors
You can read the summary of the decisions on lead in plumbing products and the structural stability of hollow-core floors at: building.govt.nz/building-code-compliance/annual-building-code-updates/2022-building-code-update .
Decision on other proposals
Due to the breadth of in-depth submissions received for the 2022 consultations, we will announce the remaining decisions prior to publishing the Building Code acceptable solutions and verification methods in November 2023.
This additional time is required to thoroughly work through the submissions and ensure all points of view are considered. This timeframe will also allow us to prepare the necessary supporting educational material such as guidance documents, learning modules and webinars.
2021 Building Code updates
In 2021 we published updated acceptable solutions and verification methods for building code clauses B1, E2, G7 and H1. The transition period for the 2021 Building Code updates ended on 2 November 2022. This means that building consent applications submitted on or after 3 November 2022 that use one of the updated acceptable solutions or verification methods as a means of compliance should now use the most recent versions of the documents.
Read more here: building.govt.nz/building-code-compliance .
Staged implementation for H1 insulation requirements for housing
The updates to the acceptable solutions and verification methods for H1 Energy efficiency are effective now. The revised documents also provide a staged transition for insulation in housing as shown in the table below:
Find the full details of the staged requirements at: building.govt.nz/about-building-performance/all-news-and-updates/transition-dates-for-the-building-code-updates-programme .
H1 education modules
To help people understand the updated H1 requirements, the Building Performance team have created new learning modules covering insulation, energy efficiency and climate zones.
Module 1 is aimed at homeowners and the general public. It explains why insulation is important in buildings to increase energy efficiency and the benefits of installing better insulation. It helps to identify the climate zones that different parts of the country fall into and the background to the new requirements for houses that will apply from May next year.
Module 2 teaches you about the different compliance pathways for the Building Code’s energy efficiency requirements, and how to choose the appropriate acceptable solution or verification method for your building.
Modules 3 and 4 are under development and will be published later this year.
Find these modules in the learning centre here: learning.building.govt.nz .
Stay up to date with Building Code updates
We know that there have been a lot of different things to get up to speed with, but we are committed to working alongside the building and construction sector to ensure successful implementation of these important changes.

PlaceMakers skills maintenance seminars continue to inform builders across the country and those who have attended have said how useful the sessions have been in helping them manage their business through this period of change.
“The seminar was very informative,” says ADM Building Limited director Alan McGuigan, who attended in Gore. “Builders are becoming more liable for the work they undertake and, while it’s a lot to keep up with, it’s important that we’re aware of what’s going on.
“Trying to understand the complete process is almost a full-time job and without these seminars, I think most builders would be ill-informed.”
Presenter John Tait says there’s plenty of content to get through and every seminar group brings up more issues being encountered by builders within the industry.
“There’s a lot for these guys to take in, but they’re making the most of the opportunity presented by these seminars by asking questions about work they’re carrying out or situations they’re coming across,” says John.
The seminars include:
LBP update – what’s happening with the skills maintenance review, how to keep good records of your learning, the increasing number of licence complaints and the most common reasons for them.
Worksafe – details about the new health and safety-focused agency and what you need to do to ensure you’re compliant.
Building Act changes – the importance of construction contracts, disclosure of information, implied warranties, defects, the yet-to-be implemented risk-based consenting and much more.
Common problems – find out what issues building contractors are encountering around the country and avoid making them yourself!
John will also discuss the importance of paying close attention to the building design and the products being used, as they are both integral components of the end result; if you take it upon yourself to change the design or substitute materials the consequences can be dire.
So, what are you waiting for? Don’t miss out on the thoroughly researched information presented in these seminars!
Contact your local PlaceMakers store to register your interest and build on the skills maintenance points you’ve already been collecting through reading Under Construction.

As promised, Under Construction will be including all compulsory Codewords articles to help LBPs earn their required points and stay up to speed with changes. This month’s article is required for carpentry, foundations, brick and blocklaying, external plastering and design licence holders
Under the new skills maintenance scheme, reading Codewords articles relevant to your licence and answering the corresponding questions is a mandatory part of skills maintenance (for those who have renewed their licence since 2 November 2015). Once you’ve read the article, answer the questions below.
Drain damage
Unlike the wastewater system, water that goes down stormwater drains flows straight into local streams and the sea without being treated. Anything else that goes down there – mud, concrete or paint for example – will pollute waterways and everything that lives in them.
For example, concrete and cement products are extremely toxic and can raise the pH levels of streams, killing all wildlife. It takes 100,000 litres of freshwater to dilute just one litre of concrete slurry to safe levels.
The consequences aren’t only severe for wildlife – discharging contaminants to stormwater drains can result in a $750 fine under the Resource Management Act and possible further court action.
One of the things resource consent inspectors look for onsite are the environmental controls you have in place to prevent contaminants such as sediments, clays and concrete products, from entering the stormwater network.
Below are some easy, inexpensive tips to ensure clean rainwater is the only thing that goes down stormwater drains at your site:
Create a stabilised entranceway for your site by putting down GAP 65 aggregate, giving tradespeople a place to park and stopping them driving over exposed clay or dirt and tracking it onto the road.
Install a silt fence 200mm into the ground on the downhill side of your site to capture sediment run-off.
Keep stockpiles of sediment or soil behind your silt fence, or cover them with plastic sheeting or hay mulch.
Keep as much grass coverage onsite as possible.
Before pouring concrete, de-water pile holes and footings to stop slurry spilling out and into drains.
Never wash concrete equipment where runoff may enter the stormwater drain – wash on unsealed ground such as grass or aggregate.
Remember, you are responsible for your subcontractors, so ensure delivery companies or pumpers don’t wash concrete slurry to the stormwater drains.

Retention money provisions will apply regardless of the amount of money involved, meaning all subcontractors are covered
T he Construction Contracts Act 2002, which covers both commercial and residential construction contracts, provides a process for dealing with payments and disputes under a construction contract.
In December 2015, the Construction Contracts Amendment Act 2015 was passed, amending the Act in three areas with different implementation dates:
Removing the differences between residential and commercial contracts (in place since 1 December 2015).
Design, engineering and quantity surveying work now covered by the Act (has been in place since 1 September 2016).
Retention money withheld under commercial construction contracts must be held on trust (due to be implemented on 31 March 2017).
In February 2017, shortly before the third stage was due to come into force, Parliament’s commerce committee proposed two changes which require further amendment to CCAA:
1) That the retention money provisions will only apply to contracts entered into, or renewed, on or after 31 March 2017.
2) That the CCAA include an alternative option for protecting money. The option proposed was obtaining a financial instrument, such as insurance or a payment bond, to provide third-party protection of retention money. There would be strict requirements on the financial instruments to ensure repayment of retention money.
If the amendments are not approved by 31 March 2017, only the existing CCAA provision regarding retention money – that it be held on trust in the form of cash or other liquid assets readily converted into cash – will come into force.
If the amendments are approved, payers, such as developers and head contractors, who choose to withhold retention money will have a second option – to obtain a financial instrument such as insurance or a payment bond, to provide third-party protection of retention money.
There would be strict requirements on the financial instruments allowed to ensure repayment of retention money. These include:
Financial instrument providers would be limited to registered banks and licensed insurers.
Financial instruments would be required to be issued in favour of subcontractors and allow them to directly enforce the ‘promise to pay’ against the provider.
Records of financial instruments would be required to be kept and made available to subcontractors at all reasonable times and without cost.
Subcontractors would benefit from the option relating to financial instruments, as they would be able to claim directly from a registered bank or licensed insurer if the head contractor fails to pay retention money when it is due.
Developers and head contractors would benefit because they would not need to hold retention money on trust.
What is a commercial contract?
A commercial construction contract means “a contract for carrying out construction work in which none of the parties is a residential occupier of the premises that are the subject of the contract”. In other words, all subcontracts are commercial.
According to New Zealand Certified Builders chief executive Grant Florence, retentions are used regularly in commercial construction contracts and, while allowable, seldom in residential construction contracts. He says some high-end, architectural builds might use retentions.
Why retention money provisions have changed
Retention money is an amount withheld by a party to a construction contract (the payer) from an amount payable to another of the contract’s parties (the payee) as performance security, which can be used to pay for any remedial action that may need to be done as a result of faulty work.
Under the old law, retention payments were not required to be set aside and were put at risk by being used as working capital. In the event of a company going bust, subcontractors often lost the retention owed to them.
The CCAA definition of a commercial contract means all contracts are covered except where one of the parties is a residential occupier of the premises that are the subject of the contract. In other words, all subcontracts are commercial and will be covered by the retention provisions.
No threshold amount proposed
During 2016, MBIE consulted the construction industry on what, if any, regulations should be made under the retention money provisions of the CCAA. The CCAA contains the power to make regulations setting a threshold amount of retention money that the provisions will apply to, and setting methods of accounting for retention money (additional to those set out in the CCAA).
No regulations are currently proposed. The retention money provisions will apply regardless of the amount of money involved to ensure payment for small subcontractors is protected.
The methods of accounting for retention money will be those set out in the CCAA.
MBIE expects industry participants to develop reporting methods that best suit the accounting systems they have in place.
Amendments explained
The changes are the result of a comprehensive review of the Construction Contracts Act 2002.
The amendments ensure the Act provides:
A fair, balanced and appropriate payment regime.
Access to fast and cost-effective dispute resolution.
Cost-effective and timely enforcement of rights and obligations.
Better certainty of payment of retention money held under construction contracts.
Further information on the Amendment Act and retentions is available on the MBIE website www.business.govt.nz

Stay up to speed with industry changes and building code clauses
P laceMakers ninth round of seminars is almost complete, and the focus on building code clauses – and their common compliance issues – is generating unprecedented discussion among attending builders.
Presenter John Tait, who has extensive experience as a building inspector, is using live examples to prompt builders to share their experience handling different situations.
This round focuses on fall safety, warning systems, and access routes.
“I expect builders to be a little surprised at what does and does not comply,” says John. “Come prepared to get involved in the discussion!”
Given that the Health and Safety Reform Bill has now passed, and changes to the skills maintenance scheme are starting from November, this round of seminars will include a review of the key concepts in the new WorkSafe Health and Safety at Work Act, as well as outlining the changes to LBP skills maintenance.
Contact your local PlaceMakers to register your interest and build on the skills maintenance points you’ve already earned through reading Under Construction .

BCITO launches strategy to better manage workforce development
I n a bid to help construction industry businesses and employers better manage the development of their workforce, BCITO has developed a Strategic Workforce Development Framework (SWDF). The plan was officially launched by Dr Nick Smith at the BCITO Skills Summit held in Wellington in October, with more than 100 BCITO national advisory group members, board members and other key stakeholders from associated federations, associations and government bodies in attendance.
Currently, just under 3% of BCITO’s active apprentices are women
The SWDF aims to educate the industry on preparing to meet predicted skills shortages. The industry’s participants need to address the factors that each employer can most influence and realistically change.
The SWDF identifies four priorities for action that can be used to help participants plan and strategically manage the development of their building and construction workforce. These priorities are:
Build an accurate picture of the current skills and capabilities of each industry sector’s workforce.
Identify future requirements for each workforce and the outcomes they wish to achieve.
Develop strategies to address any gaps between the workforce and desired outcomes.
Consider and understand the overall impact of business strategies on workforce development.
These priorities and the catalyst for developing the framework are covered below:
Construction activity
National demand for new houses in 2017 is forecast to be 28,000. With our current workforce capability, we are building 15,000 homes.
In 2014, there were 155,200 people employed in the construction industry sectors covered by BCITO. By 2019, this is forecast to climb on average by almost 5% per year to 197,300.
The construction industry workforce
The average age of people in the construction industry is 42, which is increasing much faster than the rest of the population.
Increasing cultural diversity in New Zealand means strategic employers cast a wide net in respect to recruitment.
Just under 3% of BCITO’s active apprentices are women.
A project-driven ‘hire-and-fire’ business cycle causes some skilled workers to leave the industry permanently.
40% of workers in the industry do not attain a post-secondary qualification of any kind.
Key points
Growth is set to continue but negative pressures in some regions exists.
Government will use policy settings to free up market conditions and stimulate some activity.
Capability and capacity of the current workforce will struggle to meet future demand.
Growing demand in Auckland may require increasing numbers of the workforce to move from locations throughout NZ.
Consideration of sustainability, as a workforce development driver, will deepen.
The industry’s skilled workforce is aging quickly and exiting the industry.
The industry is recruiting from a shrinking pool of people.
Greater workforce diversity is required to meet labour requirements.
The current rate of industry training does not match demand.
Skills demand will continue to develop.
Industry training needs to align with workforce development.
Industry needs to actively work to attract people into the industry and to keep them for a longer period of time and make sure that people understand that construction offers a career – not just a job.
To read BCITO’s Strategic Workforce Development Framework and find out how it can assist you to build your People Plan, visit BCITO.org.nz/news-and-publications/strategy-documents .
This initial document is just the first step in an ongoing process to help skills-proof our industry. In the next phase, BCITO will engage you with a sector-specific plan for your particular trade. This will happen in the first half of 2016.

The third article in the series looking at the history of the Licensed Building Practitioners Scheme with MBIE’s Bruce Duggan
The Report of the Overview Group on the Weathertightness of Buildings , better known as the Hunn Report – named after the chairperson of the Overview Group – was released by the Building Industry Authority (BIA) in the second half of 2002. The report’s recommendations were the catalyst for major changes in the way we build.
Terms of Reference
The Group was established to look at the nature, extent and effects of the failures, possible inadequacies in the Building Code, and consenting and inspection processes.
It also looked at products and materials, trade skills and responsibilities, potential deficiencies in the administration of the Building Act and Regulations, and whether we were following the purposes and principles of the Act.
Changes to our industry
The report included 20 recommendations. Several of these called for the BIA to do such things as:
Issue public warnings about the risk of collapse of cantilevered decks supported by untreated timber (remember the deck from the first article in this series?).
Assess and publicise the health risks associated with fungal decay.
Revise E2/AS1 – the External Moisture clause in the Building Code.
Work with the Building Officials Institute of New Zealand (BOINZ) to look at the level of information required in building consent applications and to develop stronger inspection regimes.
Review current product appraisal practices.
Take a more proactive stance to research within the industry.
Other recommendations for the building sector, including the BIA, were:
Looking at providing interpretation guidelines for the Act, determining the need for tertiary qualifications and continuing professional development programmes for inspectors.
Looking at improving the definitions of the roles, responsibilities and obligations of all parties through building contracts.
Working with the Building and Construction Industry Training Organisation (BCITO) and appropriate sector groups to review the carpentry apprenticeship to ensure an appropriate balance of academic and practical knowledge.
Improving accountability for the quality of construction under our current performance-based system.
Keeping the public and industries such as banking and insurance fully informed.
All of the recommendations in the report were acted upon to some extent, and many of them created very real changes to the way we regulate and build in New Zealand. This includes better-trained Building Consent Officers, more detailed site documents and inspection requirements, the accreditation of Building Consent Authorities, changes to apprenticeship training and outcomes, a massive increase in the size of E2/AS1 , and more detailed and readily available manufacturer’s instructions.
There was, however, another recommendation which resulted in arguably the biggest change to our industry since the introduction of the Building Act 1991:
That the BIA, in conjunction with the appropriate affected sector groups – a) explore the issues involved in advocating the national registration of builders and building related trades, given the contents of this report and concerns expressed about the standards of some trade practices on-site; and b) support such advocacy if it is convinced of the benefits to the industry.
That the BIA promotes debate on the issues of trade regulation, professional education and builder registration at the proposed executive forum.
The Building Act 2004
The Building Act 2004 was the means by which many of the changes inspired by the Hunn Report were made, but it was Subpart 4 that introduced the beginnings of the LBP scheme (see textbox).
It was a further eight years until the introduction of Restricted Building Work (RBW), but 2002 set the wheels in motion.
Firstly, RBW needed to be defined, and the people involved in that work needed to be identified. The definition and the licence classes identified were:
Licensed Building Practitioner licence classes are design, carpentry, roofing, brick and block laying, external plastering, foundations, and site.
RBW is work that’s critical to make a home structurally sound and weathertight. It covers residential design, construction or alteration work that requires a building consent, and involves a home’s primary structure, weathertightness, and certain fire safety design (such as in apartments and townhouses).
For further information, see Restricted Building Work on the building.govt.nz website.
See the next issue for the continuation of this series.
Subpart 4 – Requirements for building work
Restricted building work must be carried out or supervised by licensed building practitioners
84 Licensed building practitioners must carry out or supervise restricted building work
All restricted building work must be carried out or supervised by a licensed building practitioner who is licensed to carry out or supervise the work.
Section 84: amended, on 15 March 2008, by section 15 of the Building Amendment Act 2008 (2008 No 4).
This article is an excerpt from Codewords Issue 102. Reading Codewords articles that are relevant to your licence class is a mandatory requirement for Licensed Building Practitioners. These questions can be answered through the LBP portal, online on the Under Construction website or recorded on the magazine, then provided at the time of renewal.

LBP or not everyone carrying out design work has the same responsibilities
Under the Building Act 2004, people who take part in building work have certain responsibilities. In the last edition of Under Construction, we looked atbuilders’ responsibilities on-site, includingthose of Licensed Building Practitioners(LBPs). This time we are looking atdesigners’ responsibilities.
Some of these responsibilities are highlighted under sections 14A–14G of the Act to ensure that if you undertake building work, you are responsible for your part of the project.
Who is a designer?
Section 14D applies to designers. It states that, for the purposes of these responsibilities, a designer includes anyone who is preparing plans and specifications for building work (not necessarily under a building consent).
It also includes giving advice about building work compliance with the building code, whether or not the work requires a building consent.
This means that designers could include:
A person holding a Design licence (1, 2 or 3).
An architect who is preparing plans and specifications for a building consent application.
An engineer engaged to inspect building work undertaken to ensure it is structurally compliant.
A builder who takes on the role of a designer and drafts some plans for a client detailing a low-level deck that will not require building consent.
Designers’ responsibilities
A designer has only one responsibility under section 14D, unlike a builder who has several under section 14E. The designer’s responsibility is to ensure that their advice or plans and specifications, if followed, will result in building work that complies with the Building Code. As the designer may not be involved in the construction, they are not responsible for whether the building work complies with the Building Code.
Designers’ obligations
It is important that designers are aware of their other obligations that relate to, but are not specifically mentioned in section 14D. This includes being aware of and not breaching any of the grounds for discipline for an LBP, which are set out under section 317.
Other sections of the Act also state that you need to be licensed to carry out or supervise design Restricted Building Work.
New competency changes
In 2016, small changes were made to the competencies in the LBP Rules for the Design licence class to keep them relevant and easier to understand. Also, a new competency was added for contract administration and construction observation and applies to Design areas of practice 2 and 3. However, you should also be aware that contracting obligations were included in other competencies for Design 1 licence class holders, as well as other minor changes.
The importance of contract administration is illustrated by elements of it being included as a core competency. A designer who acts inappropriately in their role of contract administration could face sanctions because such conduct might breach a ground for discipline relating to negligence or incompetence.
You can read more about the design competency changes in Codewords issue 76 at www.building.govt.nz .

MBIE’s latest guidance aims to resolve common areas of dispute between contractors and homeowners
The Guide to tolerances, materials and workmanship in new residential construction is now available. Prepared by the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE), it aims to assist contractors and homeowners, who may be unsure of what constitutes a defect within the Building Act 2004.
This guide focuses on issues that can lead to disputes between building contractors and homeowners, but which fall outside the Building Code, contract documentation and manufacturers’ specifications and installation instructions. It outlines what constitutes acceptable levels of workmanship in standard domestic construction types under normal conditions, and is targeted at new residential building work.
“A building contractor cannot be held liable for work or damage caused by the owner, occupier, or by another person contracted separately by the owner to complete a certain task
The guidance was written with advice from the industry and supports the new consumer protection measures in Part 4A of the Building Act, which came into law on 1 January.
Under the new consumer protection measures, a 12-month defect repair period starts from:
the completion of the building work under a written contract, or
the completion of the physical building work, in cases where there is no written contract.
During this time, it is the main contractors’ responsibility to fix any defects, or prove that any defective building work is through no fault of their own, the subcontractors under their control, or the products supplied if there is a dispute.
The Guide to tolerances, materials and workmanship in new residential construction covers mainly aesthetic issues (eg, what is considered a reasonable slope in a floor, or what is an acceptable appearance for a newly painted wall) in new builds and additions at any price, whether or not the consumer protection measures and $30,000 threshold apply.
The guide does not cover tolerances for repairs, renovations, or alterations within existing buildings. Tolerances for existing buildings are likely to be below those achievable with new buildings. There are a number of reasons for this, including the nature of the materials used in existing buildings and the effects of both time and natural events.
It is also a great tool to make sure clients understand and agree what acceptable levels of tolerances, materials and workmanship are for new residential building work. It can be used before contracts are signed, to help align expectations of quality with choice of design, materials, finishes and costs.
The Guide to tolerances, materials and workmanship in new residential construction is not a mandatory set of standards. Contractors and clients can mutually agree to their own expectations, preferably within their written contract.
The defects covered in this guide are specific to those resulting from the actions (or inactions) of the building contractor. A building contractor can only be held liable for work done within the construction contract, and by the specialist trades they have commissioned. A building contractor cannot be held liable for work or damage caused by the owner, occupier, or by another person contracted separately by the owner to complete a certain task.
The building contractor cannot be held liable for an event that is not attributable to the building contractor, including:
Damage that occurs outside of human control – eg, a natural disaster.
Damage done by a person outside of the building contractor’s control.
Damage resulting from a failure to undertake normal maintenance.
Damage resulting from a failure to carry out repairs as soon as practicable after the defect becomes apparent (section 362S).
If an owner requires a building contractor to carry out work the building contractor knows will result in a less-than-satisfactory finish or outcome for one or both parties, this should be put in writing to the owner before commencing such work.
Owner dissatisfaction with an outcome that is installed to specification and to a reasonable standard (as outlined in this guide) is not a defect. For example, an owner cannot expect a level 5 plaster finish if the specification called for a level 4 plaster finish.
ISSUES EMERGING OVER TIME
Over time, buildings are subject to the weather, shaking from traffic, minor earthquakes and ground settlement. These result in gradual deterioration of materials (particularly exterior cladding and exterior timbers used in decking, fencing and pergolas, etc), and often development of non-structural cracks at joints and junctions in sheet materials (particularly internal wall and ceiling linings). Unless otherwise agreed in the contract, provided these remain within the tolerances found in relevant parts of this document, they are not considered defects. Where issues emerge after the 12-month defect notification period, these may still be covered under the implied warranties or other legislation (see ‘Introduction of new consumer protection measures’).

LBP or not, anyone carrying out building work carries the same responsibilities as a builder
Under the Building Act 2004, people who take part in building work have certain responsibilities. Some of these are highlighted under sections 14A–14F of the Act to ensure that, if you take part in building work, you are responsible for your part of the project.
There are sections for different parties – from owners, designers, builders, through to building consent authorities. This article takes a brief look at builders’ responsibilities.
Who is a builder?
Section 14E applies to builders. It states that a builder includes anyone carrying out building work, regardless of whether or not they are in trade. The following could all be considered builders for this purpose, because they are all doing building work:
• An owner-builder doing Restricted Building Work (RBW) under an owner-builder exemption they received from the council. • An external plasterer’s apprentice. • A fully fledged Licensed Building Practitioner (LBP) carpenter.
Builders’ responsibilities
A builder has two responsibilities under section 14E:
(a) To ensure that the building work complies with the building consent and any consented plans and specifications. (b) To ensure that any building work not covered by a building consent still complies with the building code.
This means that if you’re doing building work, you need to make sure that it complies with any consent requirements such as inspections, natural hazards or resource management conditions. You need to follow the consented plans and specifi cations, and have them amended or varied if you need to deviate from them.
As always, if you’re undertaking exempt building work, it needs to comply with the Building Code. This is made clear in section 17 of the Act, which states that “all building work must comply with the Building Code”.
Even though the owner (or someone they contract to act as their agent) is responsible for obtaining a building consent before starting building work (covered in section 14B for owners), LBPs can be disciplined for carrying out work where a building consent was required but not obtained.
LBP responsibilities
An LBP has additional responsibilities when they are a builder under the Act. An LBP is also required to ensure: (a) That any RBW is carried out or supervised as required by the Act. (b) They are licensed to carry out or supervise the RBW they are undertaking.
Section 14E clearly states builder’s responsibilities in one place. In addition, for LBPs, the grounds for discipline are set out in section 317, and other sections of the Act also state that you need to be licensed to carry out or supervise RBW.
If you, as an LBP, don’t follow the responsibilities set out in section 14E or the other requirements of the Act, you could be disciplined by the Building Practitioners Board or you could even be committing an offence that could lead to prosecution.
You can read more about exempt building work in Codewords issues 78, 79 and 80 at www.building.govt.nz.
Further information on the Amendment Act and retentions is available on the MBIE website www.business.govt.nz

Written contracts provide clarity about rights, obligations and expectations. Since 1 January 2015, it has been mandatory to have a written contract with your client for all residential building work that costs $30,000 (including GST) or more
If you’re a contractor, you must provide a written contract for residential building work costing $30,000 or more (GST inclusive). MBIE recommends you have a contract even if the work will cost less than $30,000, so everyone has an understanding of obligations, requirements and expectations. It helps to protect both you and your client, and can make your life a lot easier if disputes arise in the future.
Since 1 January 2015, under Part 4A of the Building Act 2004, it has been mandatory to have a written contract with your client for all residential building work that costs $30,000 (including GST) or more. This does not apply to subcontracts between a main contractor and a subcontractor.
Free online contract
NZS 3902:2004 is a standard building contract you can use for clients who engage you to build their house, or to do simple building work or alterations.
MBIE has sponsored NZS 3902:2004 , so that anyone can download this contract for free from the Standards New Zealand website and comply with the mandatory contracting provisions.
Although this contract is expected to be used mainly for house construction, it can also be used without amendment for other small building works.
Why it’s useful
Using NZS 3902:2004 will also ensure the terms of your contract with the client meet the minimum requirements set out in Part 4A of the Building Act 2004 (which requires a written contract as noted above).
Know your stuff: Consumer protection has further information on your other obligations.
Disagreements can happen during construction. If they do, NZS 3902:2004 sets out a disputes resolution process that may help you reach a solution. You may also consider getting legal advice when dealing with disputes.
Not for every occasion
While NZS 3902:2004 is useful, it is not appropriate for all situations, and in some instances you may need to either seek advice or use other standard contracts that are better suited.
You can also prepare or have a lawyer prepare a contract for you, or the client (or their agent or designer) may propose using some other standard contract (such as NZS 3916:2013 Conditions of contract for building and civil engineering – Design and construct ).
NZS 3902:2004 Housing, alterations and small buildings contract can be freely downloaded on the Standards New Zealand website. You can also purchase NZS 3902:2004 as hard copy or an online library subscription.
NZS3916:2013 Conditions of contract for building and civil engineering – Design and construct can be purchased on the Standards New Zealand website.
Contractors: Do your homework has further information on consumer protection measures if you’re doing residential building work.

New LBP registrar determines areas of focus required to improve scheme recognition
A month into his appointment, LBP registrar Paul Hobbs is busy getting up to speed. On his appointment, he said his aim was to work with the Building Practitioners Board to help promote, recognise and support professional skills and behaviour in the building industry.
Paul is confident the scheme will continue to develop and mature over time. However, below are some of the areas he believes require focus going forward.
A review of skills maintenance is currently underway and the MBIE has been working with LBPs and the wider sector to understand how they’re finding the current scheme, and to explore what could be improved. This includes strengthening the brand – ensuring  the LBP scheme becomes more widely recognised by consumers as a symbol of competence. A range of possible changes, which will then be consulted on, are already being developed.
The skills maintenance review is due to be completed by the end of September 2014, and will be featured in Under Construction .
The recent formation of the electrical and building occupational licensing team (EBOLT) supports the Ministry’s aim to become a centre of excellence for occupational licensing. EBOLT brings together the former Licensed Building Practitioners Team and Electrical Workers Teams within MBIE, meaning the EBOLT team is now responsible for administering some 55,000 licence holders across the many areas of practice.
MBIE and Building Consent Authorities are actively pursuing complaints against people who choose to undertake restricted building work (RBW) without being licensed or being under supervision to do so. As a general rule, the sector appears to have come to terms with RBW requirements; however, some individuals continue to operate outside the law.
In addition to the above, MBIE continues to support the Building Practitioners Board, process new LBP applications, administer complaints and appeals for LBPs and build and enhance the LBP brand through sector engagement and advice, education and information.
PlaceMakers next round of skills maintenance seminars will focus on regulatory changes, technical guidance and business tips, ensuring you maintain the level of competence necessary to be a licensed building practitioner.

In addition to expanding the range of low-risk work not requiring a building consent, Building Amendment Act 2013 gives MBIE and councils additional powers, as well as clarifying and re-wording some existing sections.
The Building Amendment Act 2013, which was enacted in November 2013, is the result of a comprehensive review of the Building Act 2004. It is part of a package of changes introducing new measures to improve the building and construction sector. The aim is to deliver good-quality, affordable homes and buildings and contribute to a prosperous economy.
Last month we focused primarily on the changes to the types of work that do not require a building consent; this month we’ll go into more detail about the additional powers given to MBIE and local councils as well as other rewording and clarification. What additional powers have been given to councils?
Councils can now prevent people from approaching or entering “affected buildings”.  [Sections 121A and 124 – 128A]
Buildings that are adjacent to, adjoining, or near to dangerous buildings or dams are “affected buildings”. Councils now have the power to put up notices, fences or hoardings to warn or prevent people from approaching or entering affected buildings.
There is a new type of Section 124 notice that allows councils to restrict entry into insanitary, dangerous or affected buildings for particular purposes or to particular people.
This type of Section 124 can be issued for an initial 30-day period and then reissued once, for a further maximum period of 30 days.
The process for dealing with complaints about Building Control Authorities (BCAs) has been made more efficient. Amendments have been made to sections 200, 202-204, 207A and 207B of the Act:
MBIE is not required to seek any information or submissions from a BCA at the early stage of deciding whether to accept or decline a complaint. MBIE may still request information at this early stage, but BCAs cannot insist that information or submissions be made
If the BCA fails to make written submissions within a reasonable time, MBIE can proceed with an investigation, or make a determination, in regard to a complaint.
MBIE can require BCAs to monitor progress and report on any remedial actions they are required to take as a result of the investigation into a complaint.
MBIE has the ability to undertake inspections of a building to review the quality of the BCA’s work.
MBIE can investigate a council’s failure to perform its functions. People who fail to provide information or documents MBIE has requested in relation to an investigation could be fined. [Sections 207A and 207B]
MBIE can authorise people to issue infringement notices and recover payment of infringement fees: [Sections 371A – 371D and 374]
MBIE enforcement officers will have a warrant to clearly state their functions and powers.
MBIE enforcement officers have the ability to issue infringement notices for infringement offences (for example, failing to disclose certain information to consumers).
MBIE can recover infringement fees, in situations where an enforcement officer, authorised by MBIE, has issued the infringement notice.
The sections that have been reworded deal with alterations (s112), change of use (s115) and subdivisions (s116A).
The amendments do not change existing requirements that cover means of escape from fire, access and facilities for disabled people, protection of other property and, in the case of change of use, sanitary facilities, structural performance and fire-rating performance.
“The process for dealing with complaints about Building Control Authorities (BCAs) has been made more efficient.
The new wording deals with the Building Code compliance of the building as a whole:
If the building complied with the Building Code before the alteration, change of use or subdivision, it must continue to comply with the Building Code after the work is completed.
If the building did not comply with the Building Code before the alteration, change of use or subdivision, then:
The new building work must comply with the Building Code.
Any parts not affected by the new building work (or which don’t have to meet specific requirements) must continue to comply with the Building Code to the same extent as before the work began.
Specific requirements apply depending on the building work being done, so it is important to check the relevant sections of the Building Act before building work begins.
There are new sections dealing with Certificates of Work and Licensed Building Practitioner (LBP) liability and the legal obligations of building product manufacturers. These sections do not change the law, but they outline rights and obligations that already exist.
LBP liability related to Certificate of Work [Section 45]:
Design work that is Restricted Building Work must be carried out,or supervised, by a Licensed Building Practitioner (LBP). The LBP then provides a Certificate of Work that accompanies an application for a building consent for the design work concerned.
Section 45 of the Act has been amended to make it clear that providing a Certificate of Work does not create new or additional liability for a design LBP over and above the liabilities that already exist for negligent or incompetent work or breach of contract.
Legal obligations of product suppliers or manufacturers under the Building Act [Section 14G]:
A supplier or manufacturer of building products is responsible for ensuring those products comply with the Building Code as long as the products are installed according to the data, plans, specifications and advice supplied by the manufacturer.
New consumer protection measures come into effect in late 2014. The aim is to encourage a professional, no-surprises relationship between you and your customers and to enable homeowners to make informed decisions about building work on their homes. MBIE will consult with the building sector while developing regulations and circulate information before the regulations come into effect. Watch out for the information in Under Construction. Knowing your responsibilities helps you to manage risk.

The fourth article in the series looking at the history of the Licensed Building Practitioners Scheme with MBIE’s Bruce Duggan
In the years following the release of the Hunn Report in 2002 and the introduction of the Building Act 2004, many changes were made for the good of our industry and the workers employed in it.
While some changes were not recognised as being the result of the leaky building saga, it all added up to a long-term goal – better, safer homes.
In this article, we take a look at some of those changes, and the impacts they had.
1. Face sealed cladding systems were removed from the Acceptable Solutions. This meant that, if someone still wished to use this form of cladding, they had to prove it would keep moisture out of the building for at least the period set out in the Building Code clause B2 (Durability).
2. Health began to take more prominence in the ‘health and safety’ message. There is now better understanding of the underlying health risks of working around mould uncovered in framing during alterations and leaky building remediation, and the organic solvent carrier systems used to deliver the preservative compounds into the timber in LOSP-treated timber.
3. Clear delineation of responsibilities were created by the NZ Standards 3900 series of construction contracts, which provided much of the definition of who was responsible for what. Gone were the days of ‘just doing it the way we always had’ onsite if you didn’t think the plans were correct or ‘buildable’.
Now, the person that didn’t follow the plans was deemed to be taking ownership of any deviation from those plans. Why would a builder want to do that, especially when their insurance policy wouldn’t cover them for it, while the designer’s insurance covered their design?
4. There were increased requirements for critical information to be provided in the site documents – what used to be a five-page set of plans for a basic house suddenly became eighteen pages or more! This may not seem like a good change, especially the extra time needed at the design stage, but it removed the need for the Territorial Authority and the builder to interpret what the designer intended.
5. Explanatory notes in plain English were to be added to the Building Act and Code, and this led into other areas. A great example would be Building Performance’s 230-page Building work that does not require a building consent guide that provides an easy, concise and reliable look at examples of how to correctly interpret Schedule 1 of the Building Act.
6. Territorial Authorities had to identify instances where District Plan requirements were influencing the planning and site coverage of multi-unit housing projects. This was a lesson from the Canadian leaky condo syndrome, found a decade earlier than our leaky buildings, which was covered in the Barrett Commission report released in 1998. It found that site coverage and boundary setbacks, which were measured from the closest point of the house to the boundary (normally the outside of the eaves or soffits) were restricting the size of building footprints. The obvious design solution to maximise site use was to create parapet walls, and therefore low mono-pitch roofs, internal gutters, and a plaster system to suit the monolithic look – the ‘Mediterranean’ style house!
Industry confidence plummets
The Hunn report grossly underestimated the potential cost of the problem at $240m. It wasn’t just the obvious cost of the repairs that needed to be considered – there were also huge legal, medical and mental health costs from living in and owning these sub-standard houses, and the fact that we’re still finding leaky buildings today that are subject to ongoing cost escalation. Who knows the real cost.
This led to an inevitable outcome – public confidence in the building industry hit new lows.
Introducing… the Licensed Building Practitioners Scheme
The introduction of the Licensed Building Practitioner regime was aimed at improving the skills and knowledge of those involved in residential construction. The following was stated as the intention of the enabling legislation:
“The Government’s goal is a more efficient and productive sector that stands behind the quality of its work; a sector with the necessary skills and capability to build it right first time and that takes prides in its work; a sector that delivers good quality, affordable homes and buildings and contributes to a prosperous economy; a well-informed sector that shares information and quickly identifies and corrects problems; and a sector where everyone involved in building work knows what they are accountable for and what they rely on others for.
We cannot make regulation more efficient without first getting accountability clear, and both depend on people having the necessary skills and knowledge. The Building Act 2004 will be amended to make it clearer that the buck stops with the people doing the work. Builders and designers must make sure their work will meet building code requirements; building owners must make sure they get the necessary approvals and are accountable for any decisions they make, such as substituting specified products; and building consent authorities are accountable for checking that plans will meet building code requirements and inspecting to make sure plans are followed.”

It’s important to provide a Record of Work upon completion of Restricted Building Work
Records of Work must be filled in on time, every time, to avoid complaints being made against you and potential disciplinary action. The Building Practitioners Board received a disappointingly high number of complaints this year about ROWs.
Don’t withhold records of work
(LBPs) hold back the ROW because they are in a dispute or because the client is behind in their payment. This is done under the belief that they can use the ROW as leverage. This is bad practice, as the disgruntled client can complain to the Board that the LBP did not complete the ROW. The Board will then have to discipline the LBP for failing to provide their ROW, regardless of any commercial dispute, as this is not a valid reason to withhold an ROW according to the Building Act.
The Board has no jurisdiction over contractual disputes – it only addresses the conduct of LBPs. Therefore, the LBP can be fined, even if the client hasn’t paid for the work.
Knowing when work is over
Usually it is easy to know when to complete the ROW. The job is finished, so you complete the ROW before moving on. However, sometimes a job ends unexpectedly. Perhaps there is a dispute between contractors, or the client stops paying the bills. If the job isn’t finished, but you won’t be returning to finish it, you should submit an ROW. On it, you can detail what work you did complete, even though the overall job was unfinished.
Sometimes it is uncertain if you will return or not. When in doubt, you can still submit an ROW on what you have done thus far. In the unlikely event you do return, you can add to your records.
Submit your own RoW, don’t pass to others
There is still the myth that if you’re a labour-only contractor to another LBP, the head contractor will do the ROW. This is not the case. Each LBP who does RBW must complete an ROW.
Another mistake is to provide the ROW to the head contractor, who does not then pass it on to the homeowner or council. The Building Act puts the responsibility on the LBP to ensure the ROW is sent to the homeowner and council. You can still be disciplined even if you did provide the ROW to the head contractor.
Typical penalties
When a complaint against an LBP for failing to provide an ROW is upheld, the Board usually issues a fine and requires a payment towards the cost of the hearing. If this was the only offence  committed by the LBP, the fine is typically $1,000 to $3,000 and costs are around $500.
This article is an excerpt from Codewords Issue 93. Reading Codewords articles that are relevant to your licence class is a mandatory requirement for Licensed Building Practitioners. These questions can be answered through the LBP portal, online on the Under Construction website or recorded on the magazine, then provided at the time of renewal.

By applying the correct procedures at the time of construction, builders can minimise the threat of decay within a building’s wall.
This article, based on weathertight remediation workshops run by MBIE – Building and Housing Group, goes back to the basics of avoiding leaky homes – ‘the 4 Ds’ of design.
NZ adopted these principles from Leaky building veterans Canada. They can be applied to all types of building projects but have particular relevance to a building that has already failed.
If less of the cladding is exposed to moisture, there will be less of the building with potential to let moisture in. A house with eaves, for example, can shelter areas of the cladding from rain. This is supported by an analysis of Weathertight Homes Resolution Service assessment reports, which shows that houses with no leaves feature at a disproportionately higher percentage than the overall building stock.
A majority of the costly damage to a leaky home is from trapped moisture, when any moisture that has breached the cladding can’t escape and insufficient ventilating air is present to permit drying.
This is arguably the most important of ‘the 4Ds’; making durability a primary concern when designing and constructing a building will often dictate the use of the other basic principles.
New Zealand has many standard detailing solutions, such as E2/AS1,which, if used, is enough to demonstrate design compliance in certain situations. But is using these ALWAYS the best way to enhance durability of a building in any situation? Is there sometimes a better way? In many cases, it may not make a material difference to the overall cost, but it’s important to remember that each scenario is different and will often require a different solution.
“Properly installed cladding cavities are excellent at addressing all of ‘the 4 Ds’, as well as providing redundancy in the system and simplifying the detailing solutions
Differential air pressures, their effect on a building and how they are dealt with can really affect the durability of a building, but they also vary greatly depending on building design and location.
High air pressure always wants to go to an area of lower pressure, as does positive pressure to negative. Positive pressure on a building (eg wind pushing on an elevation) will create negative pressure (uplift) on both sides of a 25 degree pitch roof. Similarly, on the other three elevations of the building, air is effectively sucked off the building, creating negative pressure.
As positive pressure travels to negative pressure, it’s important pay attention to its effect on the building wrap at external wall corners, or wall to roof junctions, as it could lead to moisture bridging to the cavity’s dry side, and/or paper rattle, which could affect the paper’s effectiveness, durability and, in many cases, be audible.
To avoid this, should you choke them to prevent moist air being potentially sucked through the corners of a cavity system, under parapet tops or into roof spaces via barges? Every situation is different and builders need to consider their options. Similarly, air seals around windows effectively choke the high pressure outside, possibly allowing moist air to be sucked through to the low pressure interior.
Properly installed cladding cavities are excellent at addressing all of ‘the 4 Ds’, as well as providing redundancy in the system and simplifying detailing solutions. With the 2011 changes to E2/AS1, there are now very few situations where an Acceptable Solution design will not require a cavity.
The ‘dry’ side of a cavity is the framing side, with the ‘wet’ side directly behind the cladding. Ideally, all moisture should be kept on the outside. However, if a design detail does not make this possible, then moisture should be contained on the wet side. If moisture is allowed to easily and regularly get to the dry side, where the structural framing is, it potentially compromises durability.
BRANZ research has found that the size of the vents in a wall cavity is the single biggest factor in the drying rate. If building wrap is baggy (especially if pushed out by insulation) or the cavity batten installation hinders the airflow, it’s important to consider how that will affect the drying capabilities of the cladding system.
Changes to the original design of a building, such as a different cladding type, installation of eaves or a pitched roof, could also be considered by a client for better adherence to ‘the 4 Ds’, an improved resale value or simply for aesthetic reasons.
In consideration of all of this, builders need to ask the question: ‘Is there a better way of achieving a durable weathertight building?’
If you believe the specified detail may fail or could be improved, talk to the designer and request a change to the specifications. In serious cases, it may even be advisable to flag and document your concerns to the homeowner and consenting authority. By doing so, it may assist in showing you have done your best to fulfil your obligations in case the detail fails later on.

The sixth and final article in the series looking at the history of the Licensed Building Practitioners Scheme (LBP) with MBIE’s Bruce Duggan
Continuing professional development (CPD) is a vital part of the LBP scheme, but why do we need it ?
“The Government’s goal is a more efficient and productive sector that stands behind the quality of its work; a sector with the necessary skills and capability to build it right first time and that takes prides in its work; a sector that delivers good-quality, affordable homes and buildings and contributes to a prosperous economy; a well-informed sector that shares information and quickly identifies and corrects problems; and a sector where everyone involved in building work knows what they are accountable for and what they rely on others for.”
The Licensed Building Practitioners scheme was built around this statement, which is just as relevant today as when it was written, prior to 2004. The part which says “a well-informed sector that shares information and quickly identifies and corrects problems” is the basis for what is arguably the single most contentious aspect of the scheme – CPD, or, as we know it, skills maintenance.
Significant errors
In August 2021, a High Court ruling said that, due to fundamental errors and failures by builders to follow installation instructions, it was not possible for 144 leaky building owners to prove that a flaw in the cement cladding product used on their building was the cause of their weathertightness problem.
It is important to remember at this point that the Hunn Report referred to the weathertightness issue as a ‘systemic failure’, where a wide range of things aligned to cause the problem – the rules, the design, district planning, building practices, training, the inspection regime, materials, product testing and appraisals, literature availability and accountabilities (or lack thereof) on site… there was no single factor to blame.
Recognising skills maintenance
Nobody wants to do a job incorrectly or badly, but if you haven’t read the manufacturer’s installation instructions to understand how and why that product works, poor performance is going to be the inevitable outcome.
If the designer doesn’t do her or his homework, he or she could specify a component or system that is not right for that situation. Or, if the building practitioner substitutes a similar product in place of the specified one, it’s going to be the same outcome – products and materials that are possibly not fit for purpose could be used.
This is especially relevant today considering the supply chain issues throughout the industry. The building consent authorities are being realistic in this regard, providing additional resources to determine which items or components may be substituted by others. The important thing is to talk to them before you change it.
To find this alternative component, a bit of research is needed – will the substituted product have similar characteristics to the original ? Sometimes an expert is needed to provide the BCA with verification that it does, so talking to the designer in the first instance is vital. This is perfect skills maintenance territory – the research, the discussion with the experts and the council, and showing the apprentice or tradespeople how and why this was done and how it works.
In this case, you can cover both ‘on the job learning’ (the research and what you learned) and ‘elective activities’ (the teaching). For the LBP that is being shown, it is also an elective activity.
The main thing about skills maintenance is recognising it – if you haven’t carried out a certain task before, or you last did it a long time ago and need to have another look at how it’s done – it’s probably skills maintenance. It’s that easy!
Watch out for a future article here for hints and examples of these learning opportunities.
Recording is easier than you think
There is also the issue of recording the skills maintenance once you’ve recognised it. With the technology we have today, it is a simple exercise – just search LBP on your phone, log in using RealMe, and click on Skills Maintenance on the left-hand side of the screen.
This brings up everything you need – you can complete the quiz questions found at the bottom of this article, record the details of the trade breakfast you went to this morning, or, if you have a few minutes, complete the ‘On The Job Learning’ section with what you have just learnt.
If you’re not able to do this on your phone, use the same procedure on your computer when you get home or, if you’re not that tech-savvy, write it in the back of your diary that day.
Once you get used to doing this regularly, you can keep up with your skills maintenance throughout the year with only a few minutes every couple of weeks, and it’s all there and complete at the end of your two-year skills maintenance cycle – no need to panic when you haven’t started it and you need to relicense next week – it’s already finished! Again, it’s that easy.
This brings this ‘History of LBP’ series to an end. A number of LBPs were not even born when the journey began back in the 90s, and a lot of others have forgotten why the scheme come into being. The main reason for this series was to reinforce the necessity for us all to continue learning, whether it’s the big stuff or the small, it all comes down to the “well-informed sector that shares information and quickly identifies and corrects problems.”
How many times have you heard the boss say “you’ll learn something new on the building site every day…” – now that’s skills maintenance!
This article is an excerpt from Codewords Issue 105. Reading Codewords articles that are relevant to your licence class is a mandatory requirement for Licensed Building Practitioners. These questions can be answered through the LBP portal, online on the Under Construction website or recorded on the magazine, then provided at the time of renewal.

PlaceMakers’ new online skills maintenance hub provides more frequent content and makes tracking your answers easy.
After months of preparation, PlaceMakers is thrilled to offer its customers everything Under Construction has to offer in one place – at www.underconstruction.placemakers.co.nz.
As mentioned in last month’s issue, this new website will feature all the same content – and even a bit extra – in an easy-to-digest, online format. With so many of you spending more and more time on the web, we want to offer your skills maintenance content through a medium most of you are comfortable navigating. Having Under Construction online will also allow us to update the site with features and industry news on a more regular basis, enabling you to spread your learning throughout the month.
This means we will no longer be mailing Under Construction to you directly. However, for those of you who prefer a hard copy in your hands, your local PlaceMakers will continue to stock issues; you’ll just have to visit the good guys at your local PlaceMakers to collect your free issue.
Most importantly, there will be no change to the ‘one hour of learning’ – or more! – available to you for skills maintenance each month. If anything, it will be even easier to record.
Remember – whether you’re reading Under Construction in print or online – the variety of content we provide and the ‘Prove your Know How’ questions enable you to claim your skills maintenance points! While the print copy will continue to feature the questions (at the bottom of each article) and the coupon on the inside back cover, the website will not only allow you to answer questions at the bottom of each feature, it will collate your answers and provide you with a score card to print out.
To answer the questions, comment on articles and access our Trade Only deals, you’ll need to create a profile for the site. Your chosen login name and password will also enable you to access the site through a number of information channels, including Facebook, Twitter, Google+ and several others.
PlaceMakers is committed to helping its tradies maintain their LBP status by providing points-earning activities such as reading Under Construction and attending seminars across the country – our new online site is another way to ensure all our customers have access to the information they need.
We trust you’ll be impressed and we look forward to taking your feedback onboard!

MBIE’s latest guidance aims to resolve common areas of dispute between contractors and homeowners
The Guide to tolerances, materials and workmanship in new residential construction is now available. Prepared by the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE), it aims to assist contractors and homeowners, who may be unsure of what constitutes a defect within the Building Act 2004.
This guide focuses on issues that can lead to disputes between building contractors and homeowners, but which fall outside the Building Code, contract documentation and manufacturers’ specifications and installation instructions. It outlines what constitutes acceptable levels of workmanship in standard domestic construction types under normal conditions, and is targeted at new residential building work.
The guidance was written with advice from the industry and supports the new consumer protection measures in Part 4A of the Building Act, which came into law on 1 January.
Under the new consumer protection measures, a 12-month defect repair period starts from: the completion of the building work under a written contract, or the completion of the physical building work, in cases where there is no written contract.
During this time, it is the main contractor’s responsibility to fix any defects, or prove that any defective building work is through no fault of their own, the subcontractors under their control, or the products supplied if there is a dispute.
The Guide to tolerances, materials and workmanship in new residential construction covers mainly aesthetic issues (eg, what is considered a reasonable slope in a floor, or what is an acceptable appearance for a newly painted wall) in new builds and additions at any price, whether or not the consumer protection measures and $30,000 threshold apply.
The guide does not cover tolerances for repairs, renovations, or alterations within existing buildings. Tolerances for existing buildings are likely to be below those achievable with new buildings. There are a number of reasons for this, including the nature of the materials used in existing buildings and the effects of both time and natural events.
It is also a great tool to make sure clients understand and agree what acceptable levels of tolerances, materials and workmanship are for new residential building work. It can be used before contracts are signed, to help align expectations of quality with choice of design, materials, finishes and costs.
The Guide to tolerances, materials and workmanship in new residential construction is not a mandatory set of standards. Contractors and clients can mutually agree to their own expectations, preferably within their written contract.
This guide is targeted at new buildings as well as alterations and additions to existing buildings. However, matching existing materials, finishes and tolerances may be difficult or even impossible in additions, alterations and repairs. It is important to be conscious of common issues that can arise when matching old and new materials. For example, older existing building materials will likely be machined or manufactured in imperial sizing, where new materials often have a smaller finished size as they are manufactured to metric dimensions. This is typically an issue with materials such as weatherboards, skirting, scotia and the like.
Where an exact match is impractical or cannot be guaranteed, a rational approach needs to be taken to determine the options and agreement reached on what are acceptable levels of workmanship. It is important the agreed acceptable levels are recorded in writing, preferably by noting it within the contract. This is particularly the case where a building has been subject to significant damage, such as from earthquake, wind, fire or land subsidence.
Tolerances, particularly for floor levels and walls out of plumb, are likely to be below those achievable with new buildings. MBIE has issued guidance on ‘Repairing and rebuilding houses affected by the Canterbury earthquakes’ which is available on the Ministry’s website (www.dbh.govt.nz/guidance-onrepairs-after-earthquake). Owners who have insurance should also check their policy documentation to see if it describes the level of workmanship that the repairs will be done to. Not all policies require the remedial work to be exactly the same as if the building was new.
Where the building work is attached to an existing structure, the contractor will only be liable for the work they have carried out (including junctions and connections).

TITLE   : Exempt from consent?

Updated and detailed Schedule 1 guidance for exempt building work was released following the November 2013 Building Act amendment – here is some further information on the exemptions and what they mean for you
As discussed in last month’s issue of Under Construction , a number of changes were made when Schedule 1 of the Building Act 2004 (the Act) was amended in November 2013.
In March this year, MBIE published new guidance to help keep you up to date with the changes.
The guidance concentrates on the 43 exemptions of Schedule 1 and is full of practical examples and photos.
It’s important that builders know what building work is exempt from a building consent, as your clients will often rely on you to advise them.
Carrying out building work that is not exempt, without a building consent, is an offence and can incur a fine of up to $200,000 and a further fine of up to $10,000 per day if work continues.
To find out more, read the guidance Building work that does not require a building consent – Building Act 2004 at www.dbh.govt.nz/bc-no-consent
Remember – all building work must comply with the Building Code, regardless of whether it needs a building consent. However, just because it doesn’t require a building consent doesn’t mean you have to go it alone.
1. Does the proposed building work clearly fall within the scope of one or more of the exemptions (excluding exemption 2)?
If you’re unsure whether the building work is exempt, ask for advice from someone with the appropriate building knowledge and expertise such as:
Building consent authorities (typically district and city councils).
Registered architects.
Chartered professional engineers.
Registered building surveyors.
Building consultants.
Design LBPs.
Registered certifying plumbers and/or drainlayers.
2. If, after seeking advice, you decide the building work is outside exemptions 1 and 3 through to 43, what should you do?
Talk to your council to see if it is prepared to exercise its discretion as to not require a building consent (ie exemption 2). If the council does not require a consent, you may still need to apply in writing for an exemption from the council.
3. If the council will not approve an exemption 2, what should you do?
Apply for a building consent.
All building work, whether or not exempt, must still comply with the Building Code and all other relevant legislation, such as the Resource Management Act 1991.
Always check with your local council for its District Plan rules (eg maximum site coverage, yard/setback requirements, sunlight access planes or permitted activities) set under the Resource Management Act 1991, as there are some discrepancies between Schedule 1 and local council requirements. If you need resource consent for the proposed building work, it’s important you get this before starting.
Find out more about the relationship between resource and building consents, how they may affect your project, and what you need to do to have your consents approved at: www.dbh.govt.nz/UserFiles/File/Publications/Building/Building-Act/resource-and-building-consent-processes.pdf .
In the new guidance, each exemption is described in detail with examples, photos and, in some cases, diagrams. It also highlights any concerns to be aware of and clarifies the type of work that is exempt and who can carry it out. Below is an excerpt from the guidance regarding one of the exemptions.
This exemption allows you to alter, remove or construct certain internal walls and doorways.
You may carry out building work in connection with an internal wall (including an internal doorway) in any existing building, unless the wall is:
(a) load-bearing; or
(b) a bracing element; or
(c) a fire separation wall (also known as a firewall); or
(d) part of a specified system; or
(e) made of units of material (such as brick, burnt clay, concrete, or stone) laid to a bond in and joined together with mortar.
Internal walls often contain bracing elements: altering or removing these walls could adversely affect the building’s structural performance. Some internal walls are also load-bearing: altering or removing these may reduce a building’s compliance with the Building Code’s structural performance requirements. Therefore, such walls are not covered by this exemption.
Building work relating to masonry walls is also outside the scope of this exemption. Masonry walls are heavy and the consequences of their collapse if they are not adequately supported are greater than for timber-framed walls.
ALERT!
All new building work must comply with the Building Code, including with its structural performance requirements. Also note that, on completion of the building work, the altered building must comply with the Building Code to at least the same extent as it did before the building work was undertaken.
If you are considering building work that is close to or involves potentially load-bearing walls, it is important to get professional advice (eg from a chartered professional engineer, registered architect, building consultant or registered building surveyor).
“If you are considering building work that is close to or involves potentially load-bearing walls, it is important to get professional advice
An owner of a residential dwelling wishes to remove a section of internal timber-framed wall to make room for a new kitchen installation. After discussing this with a building practitioner, she is satisfied that the section of wall is not load-bearing and is not a bracing element. This building work does not require a building consent.
An owner of a commercial property wishes to build a metal-framed internal wall to provide privacy in a reception area. As the wall is not load-bearing, has no bracing element and is not a firewall, a building consent is not required.
The owner of a dwelling wishes to remove a non-load-bearing wall between the kitchen and laundry to provide for an enlarged kitchen space. The timber-framed wall has no bracing elements and therefore the building work does not require a building consent.
A hotel owner wants to cut a new opening in an existing masonry wall to create an open-plan lobby and reception area. The owner seeks guidance from her local council and an architect. Historic plans are reviewed and the architect discovers that the wall is load-bearing. As the proposed alteration affects a masonry, load-bearing wall, a building consent is required.
An owner of a building wishes to install a door in an internal wall that is not load-bearing. However, the wall is made out of reinforced brick, so a building consent is required.
The owner of a dwelling wishes to remove part of an internal metal-framed wall between the hallway and kitchen. She seeks advice from a licensed building practitioner who, after a quick visit to the house, informs her that the wall is load-bearing. Therefore, the removal would require a building consent.

TITLE   : LABOUR-ONLY CONTRACTS – PART 2

This is the second article in a two-part series highlighting common misunderstandings about the responsibilities of an LBP under a labour-only contract
The first part discussed the difference between liability and accountability and how this applies to building consents. This issue will look at an LBP’s responsibility to provide accurate Records of Work (ROW) and produce quality work.
Providing ROWs
A ROW must be provided by each LBP completing restricted building work (RBW) on a project, as required by the Building Act 2004. The ROW must be supplied to the homeowner and the Territorial Authority.
A common complaint received by MBIE is that an LBP didn’t provide a ROW for a range of reasons, including:
Misunderstanding that providing a ROW will generate additional liability for the work.
Being complacent or forgetful about completing paperwork.
Withholding the ROW due to a dispute regarding payment or quality of work.
None of these, however, are valid reasons not to provide a ROW. As an LBP you have an obligation to provide the ROW, regardless of if there are contractual or payment disputes. You do not need to wait for the entire project to be complete to issue your ROW, just for your part of the work to be finished. In a situation where the contract has broken down, and you are unlikely to do any more work, you can still provide a ROW for the work you’ve already done.
Completing ROWs
The completed ROWs must also be accurate. An employer may find it easier to get one LBP to provide a ROW for all RBW completed within their class of licence, where in fact more than one LBP has carried out the RBW. Each LBP who has undertaken RBW must complete a ROW, or they will be in breach of their legal obligations. In other cases, an employer may be understaffed and request an LBP to provide a ROW stating that they supervised work done by unsupervised unlicensed workers. An LBP should resist doing this, as they may be held accountable for the work done.
If you complete a ROW, you should ensure that the details are correct, as it creates an accurate record of who did what RBW. If there is an issue with the RBW completed and you were the LBP that completed the ROW, it will be harder to prove that someone else is responsible for the work and you will expose yourself to the risk of disciplinary action.
Quality work
Aside from the right to carry out  RBW, a building practitioner’s licence shows the public and potential clients that you meet a minimum standard  of competency.
This provides confidence in your knowledge and skill, and raises you above an unlicensed building practitioner. Regardless of whether you are directly hired by the homeowner or subcontracted, you must complete work to a professional standard and only do work you are competent to do.
If you are learning a new technique within your licence class, ensure you  get advice and support so you know you are doing it correctly. You will still need to complete a ROW, as you are the one doing the work.
It can be difficult to say no when an employer asks you to do work outside your competence or substandard work. There may be financial or time constraints putting pressure on the project. Your responsibility, however, is to only carry out building work that you can do competently and to a reasonable standard. To protect yourself, you should say no if an employer asks you to compromise your professional integrity to meet  their targets. While you may not have to answer to the homeowner directly, you can still be held accountable by the Building Practitioners Board (the Board) for any negligent or incompetent work you do.
Disciplinary action
Working under a labour-only contract may reduce your liability in court, but it does not reduce your accountability as an LBP in front of the Board. If you fail to meet your obligations as an LBP, regardless of what your employer has instructed you to do, you may face disciplinary action. This could include fines and losing your licence for a period of time.

TITLE   : LBP Code of Ethics in force

The new LBP code of ethics came into force on October 25, 2022 and sets behavioural standards for Licensed Building Practitioners (LBPs )
Originally announced in October 2021 with a 12-month period before it came in, the Code of Ethics aims to ensure that high standards are maintained in the industry. It also wants to give the public more confidence that LBPs are “reputable and operate ethically,” according to the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE).
“Homeowners can have greater confidence that when they choose an LBP to undertake building work, they are doing so in a safe, legal, and professional way, and that LBPs will take responsibility for their work.”
MBIE said the code of ethics will also create a framework to discipline LBPs who behave unprofessionally.
By the book
“A Code of Ethics aligns the LBP scheme with international best practice. It also provides clear grounds for the Building Practitioners Board to take disciplinary action against LBPs who behave unprofessionally. The Board is able to issue fines or cancel licences where necessary.” – said MBIE.
The code of ethics comprises 19 standards across four principles: work safely, act within the law, take responsibility for your actions and behave professionally.
It was developed following consultation “with key stakeholders and all LBPs,” said MBIE. Consultation ran for eight weeks and contacted around 26,000 people. Over the course of the consultation period, MBIE received 79 written submissions and 277 webinar attendees.
Industry reaction
The introduction of a Code of Ethics has been met with differing opinion. Speaking to Under Construction, Trident Homes franchisee Hamish Broomfield said he was behind its introduction but thinks it could be marketed better.
“I don’t think introducing an LBP Code of Ethics is a bad thing. I believe that if LBPs are being dishonest or doing something dodgy, they should get called out for it and held accountable. I understand that some people may think introducing a code of ethics would improve the public’s confidence in the scheme, but for that to happen the public has to be aware of it in the first place! For example, I’ve never been asked by a potential customer if I’m an LBP.”
Ben Allan, CEO of David Reid Homes, took a stronger view on its introduction.
“I think a Code of Ethics is a good idea and completely appropriate for members of a professional organisation. A Code of Ethics should be a key part of what you sign up for when you register to become an LBP and something official that you can be held accountable for is important.”
Meanwhile Sam Manson, the director of SMBC, reckons the code of ethics is redundant.
“I don’t feel that the LBP scheme needs a Code of Ethics. If you’re an LBP, you’ve already been through a rigorous process to join the scheme and that means you’re far less likely to be a cowboy or display unethical behaviour.”

LBP competencies for Design, External Plastering and Brick and Blocklaying have been amended
D evelopments in construction industry practices mean licence class competencies need to be updated and clarified from time to time in order to remain relevant. If competencies are not kept up to date, LBPs may not be assessed for competency in some relevant areas, leaving gaps in the industry.
Results of consultation
The LBP team consulted publicly on the proposed competency changes in 2014 and early in 2015. The Ministry received feedback from individual LBPs and industry groups. The consultation process also offered up the opportunity to address some underlying issues in the competency structure and adjust the competencies to reflect other changes in legislation.
The most significant change affects external plasterers, with the inclusion of performance indicators related to the installation of substrates in their competencies. This means the installation of any substrate is now a candidate for restricted building work (RBW), and can only be completed by a licensed carpenter or external plasterer.
Changes made
The changes are generally technical in nature and have been made to the Bricklaying and Blocklaying, External Plastering and Design licence classes. They update and clarify competencies to reflect current practice and to improve competency structure. Some of the main changes to all three licence classes are summarised below.
1. External Plastering changes – will take effect 23 March
The inclusion of more generic terminology – ‘installation of the substrate’ – in the proprietary plaster cladding system (PPCS) external plastering competencies closes a loophole in the current competencies. Previously, the PPCS competencies were limited to installing and plastering over two specific substrates – lightweight fibre cement-based sheet or an exterior insulating finishing system (EIFS). Now that the language has changed, the PPCS competencies apply to the installation of any type of PPCS substrate. This means it is now RBW, provided it meets other RBW requirements such as being residential only and requiring a building consent. This change requires a licensed carpenter or external plasterer to install or supervise the installation of any PPCS substrate where the overall work is RBW.
This change requires a licensed carpenter or external plasterer to install or supervise the installation of any PPCS substrate where the overall work is RBW.
A stucco area of practice was previously proposed but was not finally included because the suite of changes intends to create broader competencies rather than specific ones. This trend is being reflected in national qualifications provided by training providers.
There are also more explicit requirements with regard to following a building consent where one has been issued.
A new competency ‘Work Safely’ has been added to External Plastering to bring together a range of safety performance indicators currently dispersed throughout the other competencies. The Health and Safety at Work Act is now cited in place of the Health and Safety in Employment Act.
These changes will become effective from 23 March 2017 to allow the industry time to prepare.
What will these changes mean for practitioners?
The changes to the PPCS external plastering competencies means that installers of aerated concrete panel products and other related cladding systems will now be carrying out RBW (if the work is residential and requires a consent). As a result, this work needs to be carried out or supervised by a Carpentry or External Plastering LBP. Installers may need to upskill their staff to become LBPs or engage LBPs to carry out or supervise the work.
The rule changes were made on Nov 10 and allowed a delayed implementation period of approximately four months; they come into force on 23 March. This means the rules only apply to building consents issue on or after the implementation date of 23 March.
The other changes are largely of a technical nature and should have a limited effect on current or prospective LBPs, most of the changes are about better aligning the competencies with current work practices and recent regulatory change.
2. Bricklaying and Blocklaying changes – already in effect
There is an updated list of technical information a LBP should be competent in assessing and interpreting. This reflects changes in Standards and Acceptable Solutions.
Reference to E2/AS3 (the code of practice for weathertight concrete and concrete masonry construction) has been included and some references to NZS3604 have been removed. This is due to section 11 largely moving into E2/AS1 .
Minor changes have been made to the performance indicator description to better reflect the type of work undertaken by practitioners. It now reads ‘structural masonry or veneer’ and not ‘bricks or blocks’.
There are more explicit requirements with regard to following a building consent where one has been issued.
A new competency ‘Work Safely’ has been added to bring together a range of safety performance indicators previously dispersed throughout the other competencies. The Health and Safety at Work Act is now cited in place of the Health and Safety in Employment Act.
These changes were implemented on 10 November 2016.
3. Design competency changes – already in effect
There are some changes to the competencies that relate to the client/designer working relationship. These are centred around establishing agreed terms of engagement, timeframes and associated costs with the design process.
Some duplication of performance indicators has been removed from the competencies to assist with clarity.
A new competency ‘Manage construction phase design’ will bring together some performance indicators from other competencies in order to improve the definition and structure of competencies. This competency only applies to Design area of practices 2 and 3.
These changes were implemented on 10 November 2016.
You can read more about the scheme, including the LBP Rules which outline the competencies, on the LBP website.

PlaceMakers ninth round of skills maintenance seminars helps builders stay across the industry’s ongoing changes
W ith the Health and Safety Reform Bill now passed and changes to the skills maintenance scheme starting from November, PlaceMakers is pleased to offer its builders another round of seminars to help them understand their new responsibilities.
“It’s great to see how well most builders have managed to stay up to speed, given how much change our industry has experienced over the last few years,” says presenter John Tait.
“By hosting these seminars, we aim to make navigating these changes easier for PlaceMakers customers.
“In this round of seminars, we will cover off key concepts in the new Worksafe Health and Safety at Work Act and quickly catch up on what’s going on with changes to LBP skills maintenance.”
The seminars will also continue to focus some time on building code clauses. This round, we will go over safety from falling, warning systems, access routes and fencing of swimming pools
“There will be plenty of photos and I expect builders to be a little surprised at what does and does not comply,” says John. “Come prepared to get involved in the discussion.”
Don’t miss out on the well-researched information presented in these seminars. Contact your local PlaceMakers to register your interest and build on the skills maintenance points you’ve already earned through reading Under Construction .

Ten PlaceMakers apprentices awarded scholarships to help them get ahead
Ten aspiring builders from across New Zealand have been given the opportunity to build a future for themselves, as part of the 2015 PlaceMakers Apprentice Scholarship Scheme (P.A.S.S.).
PlaceMakers developed the programme three years ago, in partnership with the Building and Construction Industry Training Organisation (BCITO). Its aim is to support the building industry by helping talented young people build a career in the sector.
From Auckland to Gore, the selected apprentices will have their BCITO tuition fees paid for by PlaceMakers throughout the duration of their studies. Each trainee will also receive ongoing mentoring, support and experience at their local PlaceMakers branch, as they work towards completing their qualification.
PlaceMakers chief executive Dean Fradgley says now is a great time for apprentices to enter the industry, with a skilled labour shortage across New Zealand.
“There hasn’t been a better time to start in the building industry in New Zealand for a long while,” says Mr Fradgley. “There’s a housing shortage in Auckland and there’s steady work in the regions. As a result, the demand for skilled builders and other dedicated tradespeople is high and will only continue to grow.”
PlaceMakers is proud to be a part of training the country’s next generation of builders.
Originally from Dunedin, P.A.S.S. Scholarship recipient David Pont inherited the building bug from his father, who was a builder for his whole working life before retiring. David says he worked in hospitality and catering jobs after leaving high school, before moving to Nelson to start an apprenticeship.
“I was looking around for a job that I really loved, and I’ve found it!” says the 22-year-old. “I really enjoy that we’re working on buildings that will be around for a long time that people get to see and use.”
David says he’s looking forward to working with his mentor and adding to his skill base. Once qualified, he says he’d like to stay with his current boss for a couple of years, to give back to the company.
“He really encouraged me towards applying for this scholarship, so I’d like to continue helping him out before going out on my own,” he says. “I’d quite like to travel as well; building’s a great trade to have, I can go anywhere in the world and apply my skills.”
Matamata’s Luke Smith got his first taste of building when he moved to Pauanui to help his grandfather build the family’s beach home.
“PlaceMakers is proud to be a part of training the country’s next generation of builders
“I’d mucked about with a couple of university papers, and then had the opportunity to help him out,” says Luke. “I really loved the lifestyle and started labouring with a builder up here, who later offered me an apprenticeship; I’ve just gone from there.”
The 21-year-old says he enjoys learning something new every day, which is why he’s excited to receive the scholarship.
“I’ve been told I’ll get to go out to factories and see how different building materials are made. I’m looking forward to that, because I think it will help with understanding the process behind working with different materials and why, from start to finish, you need to do it right.”
He says his plan is to gain as much experience as possible in the next five years, before making any big plans for the future.

Anchors that fix bottom plates to concrete slab-on-ground floors are an essential component of timber frame construction as they secure the upper building structure to the foundation
They must be able to withstand forces in three directions – uplift (tension), along the wall (in-plane shear) and across the wall (out-of-plane shear).
Two options for fixing bottom plates
Section 7 of NZS 3604:2011 Timber-framed buildings provides two options for fixing bottom plates to concrete floor slabs:
Cast-in anchors consisting of M12 bolts and either 50x50x3mm square washers or 55 x 3mm round washers that are cast into the concrete; or
Tested proprietary anchors that are inserted in the concrete once it has sufficiently cured.
A range of proprietary anchors are available, including anchors screwed into pre-drilled holes, anchors chemically grouted into pre-drilled holes, expanding or wedge anchors.
The focus here is on screw-type anchors inserted into pre-drilled holes.
Anchors screwed into pre-drilled holes
Screw-type anchors were initially designed as removable fasteners for fixing plant and machinery to concrete walls and floors. In residential and commercial construction they have become a popular option when inserted into pre-drilled holes, for fixing timber bottom plates to concrete floor slabs.
Screw-type anchors offer some advantages over other types of proprietary anchors as they are:
Quick and easy to install – drill a hole in the correct location in the concrete floor, align the timber framing and install the screw anchor using either a power driver or manual socket or wrench.
Easily removed.
Less likely to cause damage to the concrete as they do not have an expanding wedge or sleeve that applies an expansion force.
A few things to consider
There are some considerations if you are going to install screw-type anchors into concrete foundations:
Have the anchors been tested to demonstrate they have the required capacity to meet the requirements of NZS 3604:2011 ?
Anchor capacity must meet the performance criteria for external and internal walls described in NZS 3604:2011 paragraphs 7.5.12.3 and 7.5.12.4 . These are shown below in Table 1.
Can screw-type anchors be used to hold down walls containing bracing?
Proprietary anchors may be used as hold-downs for walls containing bracing but require additional uplift capacity depending on the bracing unit (BU) ratings:
150BUs/m – 15kN uplift fixings
120BUs/m – 12kN uplift fixings.
Proprietary anchors should also have test results to demonstrate that they have been tested and meet the NZS 3604: 2011 requirements for their intended use.
Can adequate cover to the anchor be achieved, particularly in exposure zone D (as described in NZS 3604:2011 )? Figures 1 (main picture) and 2 provide two details of how the maximum cover can be achieved.
Edge distances and spacings
NZS 3604:2011 does not give edge distance dimensions for proprietary anchors as the dimensions depend on the particular product and the slab edge detail, frame width, concrete strength and load.
Anchor spacings for proprietary anchors are given in the Standard as:
900mm centres maximum for in-situ concrete floor slabs.
600mm centres maximum where the slab edges are formed using concrete masonry header blocks.
No more than 150mm from each end of every plate.
Durability depends on use
The protection required for all structural fixings for all zones in closed environments may be mild steel (ie, uncoated and non-galvanised) in accordance with NZS 3604:2011 Table 4.1. However, the Standard states that where fixings are fixed into timber treated with a copper-based preservative, the fixings in closed environments should be at least hot-dipped, galvanised steel.

In this multi-part series, we’re taking a look at the history of the Licensed Building Practitioner scheme with MBIE’s Bruce Duggan
In the latter half of the 1990s, an alarming issue started to appear in recently built houses in New Zealand. Following investigations into an upper-level deck collapse (among other examples), it was found that we had a problem.
Building control in NZ It should be remembered that it was only a few years earlier that the Building Act 1991 was passed into law. This new building control system introduced a performance-based method, changing the focus from how a building must be designed and constructed to how a building needs to perform in its intended use.
The purpose of the Building Act is to ensure that people can use a building without endangering their safety or health. A building also should be able to be used by people regardless of their health, physical independence and wellbeing, as well as hitting other measures such as people being able to escape in the event of fire. A building should also promote sustainable development throughout its lifecycle and, of course, all building work must comply with the Building Code.
In the hierarchy of building controls, the Building Act is the governing law, under which are the Building Regulations. The Building Code sits within Schedule 1 of the Building Regulations 1992, and it sets the minimum performance criteria to which all building work in NZ must comply. The intent was that when a building consent was required, a full set of drawings and specifications would be provided, and, once approved, the building would be built to comply with those documents.
What happened next? Back to the investigation into the deck collapse. In this instance, the cantilevered deck joists had not been installed to prevent water ingress as per the Building Code requirements.
The result of this was that rainwater was able to run along the top of the joists, past the cladding and into the interior of the house. Once inside the house, gravity took over and the moisture ran down the sides of the joists, onto the top plate, and into the wall framing.
The resulting damage As we know, when moisture enters an area where there is little or no air movement it will soak into a product such as timber and eventually cause that timber to rot. This is what happened to the deck – the joists rotted sufficiently to reduce the strength required to support the cantilever, and when a group of people gathered on the deck, it collapsed.
A developing picture Investigations into building failures were beginning to paint a bleak picture – our houses were allowing water to enter the primary structure from where it could not escape. It was found that we had water ingress problems through incorrectly flashed junctions and penetrations through walls, as well as through some types of claddings – particularly sheets which require face sealing to provide the weatherproofing.
Different causes were being uncovered almost, it seemed, on a daily basis – parapet flashings missing; head flashings being omitted where plaster cladding systems were used; top mounted brackets on parapets; incorrect levels at entranceways; poorly designed, specified and built decks above habitable rooms; saddle flashings missing; substitution of specified products or systems; and the list goes on.
A major building failure was beginning to appear…

TITLE   : The owner-builder exemption

Facebook
Twitter

When Restricted Building Work (RBW) became law in 2012 measures were put in place to enable homeowners to build or alter their own homes following some intense lobbying to protect the DIY tradition in New Zealand
S ections 90A to 90D were inserted into the Building Act 2004 on 13 March 2012 and introduced the owner-builder concept which allowed the tradition to continue, but with conditions. A homeowner who qualifies for this exemption does not need to use a Licensed Building Practitioner (LBP) for any RBW on their home, but they still need to apply for a building consent.
To qualify for the owner-builder exemption, the owner of a building must:
Live, or intend to live in the home (this includes a bach/crib or a holiday home).
Carry out the RBW themselves or with the help of unpaid friends or whānau.
Not have used the owner-builder exemption to carry out RBW to any other home in the previous three years.
The owner must give notice to the council
The owner is required to complete the statutory declaration form as part of the building consent application to obtain an owner-builder exemption, outlining what RBW they intend to complete under the owner-builder exemption.
The owner must give notice to the building consent authority if there is a change in the owner-builder carrying out the RBW or when the owner-builder ceases to carry out the RBW under the approved exemption.
Restricted building work
An owner-builder will be responsible for ensuring that RBW carried out under the owner-builder exemption complies with the building consent and the plans and specifications to which the building consent relates. The building consent authority will still carry out the normal building inspections.
Any RBW that is not done by the owner-builder or their unpaid friends or whānau must be carried out by an LBP who holds the appropriate licence. The LBP must provide a Record of Work once that work is completed. The owner-builder may also hire a designer to draw their plans, and the designer will need to provide a Certificate of Work.
There is some specialised work that the owner-builder cannot carry out including plumbing, gas-fitting, drain-laying, and electrical work.
The council will record the building work and who carried it out on the property land information memorandum. Any future buyers will have access to this information showing whether it was carried out as a do-it-yourself project by the owner or done by an LBP.
How the owner-builder exemption applies to LBPs with trade or design licenses
Given the requirement that any person who assists the owner must do so without payment and on the basis that they are friends or whānau, an LBP hired by the owner does not come within the owner-builder exemption.
It follows that an LBP who carries out RBW in relation to an owner-builder exemption for reward must provide a Record of Work for any RBW they carry out or supervise.
An LBP should also take care when being engaged to carry out RBW on a building consent that has been issued under an owner-builder exemption that they do not, unwittingly, breach the building consent that has been issued. In this respect, an LBP should also note the provisions of section 89 of the Act which requires them to notify the building consent authority of a breach of the building consent.
The LBP code of ethics
The Code of Ethics applies to LBPs carrying out any building work whether it’s RBW or not, and therefore applies when you’ve been engaged by an owner who is carrying out work under the owner-builder exemption.
If you are onsite as an LBP, be mindful of the behaviours expected of an LBP, and what RBW you are allowed to carry out or supervise under your licence. If, for instance, your licence is in roofing and there is someone onsite carrying out blockwork which is RBW, make sure that you have made the owner aware that you cannot supervise that blockwork as it is outside your licence class. However, if the owner is helping you put the roof on, then you must ensure they’re doing the work correctly and you will need to show on your Record of Work that you were supervising them.
Knowing what work you’re allowed to do is just one part of the Code of Ethics – the other 18 standards will also apply to at least some extent while working on the above project, just as they do while you’re undertaking any building work under your licence. You can find out more about the LBP Code of Ethics on the LBP website.
The Site licence holder
The above does not apply to an LBP who is licensed in the Site licence class. The Site licence holder would not be able to work for payment on a project under the owner-builder exemption as they are not able to carry out or supervise RBW. They may only work as an unpaid friend or family member and would be under the supervision of the owner-builder.
More information on the obligations and responsibilities of owner-builders and their building project can be found at owner-builder obligations on the Building Performance website.
This article is an excerpt from Codewords Issue 112. Reading Codewords articles that are relevant to your licence class is a mandatory requirement for Licensed Building Practitioners. These questions can be answered through the LBP portal, online on the Under Construction website or recorded on the magazine, then provided at the time of renewal.

Little has changed since BCITO reported a shortage of apprentices in the construction industry three months go. With work projected to increase considerably in the near future, now is a good time to recruit apprentices – both so you can meet the growing demand now and leave the industry in good ‘hammer hands’ for years to come
BCITO chief executive Ruma Karaitiana says “this is the best time anyone could hope for to enter the industry.”
A 12% increase in construction activity accounted for two thirds of the overall increase in GDP during the March 2014 quarter. This was driven by large lifts to both residential and non-residential building activity. With residential consent numbers around most of the country continuing to climb, and the non-residential rebuild in Canterbury gearing up, the construction sector will continue being a key contributor to growth throughout 2014.
Without a significant increase in trainee numbers, the construction industry won’t have enough trained professionals to cope with the increased volume in the near future.
Statistics supplied by economic analysts Infometrics show the value of commercial building work in the March quarter was up 91% from a year earlier, the strongest lift since 2004. Nationwide new dwelling consents are expected to increase by an average of 14% per annum over the three years to March 2017. This projected yearly build rate of 33,200 would be less than the 2004 peak, but is backed by projections indicating that further increases in residential construction are needed to meet underlying demand.
There was also very strong growth in office consents (112%) and retail consents (48%) from the March 2013 quarter. Infometrics predicts that growth in commercial building activity will continue at a rate of at least 2.5% per annum during the next two years.
Employers in the building and construction industries should take on apprentices now, in order to curb an imminent skilled labour shortage. There are a number of other good reasons to bring new blood into the industry:
Does your business have an ageing staff profile? When your older employees with many years of industry knowledge exit, your business will need up-and-coming professionals in training to be able to retain those valuable skills and experience.
Have you been thinking about a succession plan? When you wish to retire or move on, will that succession happen from within your business?
The Government’s incentive of the Apprenticeship Reboot Scheme* offers financial assistance to trainees and employers, who sign into training agreements before 31 December 2014.
Apprentices learn from the boss or trainer on the job every day. They put in time ‘on the tools’, learn the ropes of the trade and work with clients and other tradespeople. Apprentices training through BCITO are provided with assessment and support. A designated training advisor will visit a few times a year to see how the apprentice is progressing. Some theory is required and apprentices are supported by their employer and BCITO to help them reach their goals.
After recently merging with FloorNZ/DecorateNZ and the Joinery ITO, BCITO is now the third-largest industry training organisation in New Zealand. BCITO now has coverage for apprenticeships and national qualifications in the following industries:
Architectural Aluminium Joinery
Glass & Glazing
Brick and Blocklaying
Interior Systems
Carpentry
Kitchen & Bathroom Design
Concrete
Masonry
Exterior Plastering
Painting & Decorating
Flooring
Tiling
Frame & Truss
Timber Joinery
*Eligibility criteria apply. Click here for full information.
Working closely with industries to provide support and meet training needs into the future, BCITO is geared up for an increase in trainee numbers and is eager to hear from any employers ready to begin taking on extra capacity. If you want someone young and fresh to help you out who’ll become a valuable member of your team and the industry give serious thought to hiring an apprentice now.  BCITO may even be able to help you find the most suitable candidate.
To learn more about apprenticeships and nationally recognised qualifications visit www.bcito.org.nz or phone BCITO on 0800 4 BCITO (422 486).

In the previous issue of Under Construction , we covered the first two principles of the LBP Code of Ethics – Working Safely and Acting Within the Law. Principle three is about taking responsibility for your actions
It is important to note again that the Code of Ethics applies to all Licensed Building Practitioners (LBPs) regardless of whether they are employed, are the employer, or are contractors. Most LBPs already meet these standards, but the introduction of the Code of Ethics will hold those who do not to account.
When undertaking work, you are representing yourself, your business or employer and the building profession. It is important to maintain a high level of trust with your clients. Not only should you be willing to get the job done to an acceptable standard for your client, but you should also be prepared to engage appropriately with your client when things do not go well.
The following are the expected standards of behaviour of LBPs under principle three.
You must be knowledgeable about what you are allowed to do
This means knowing what your licence class permits you to do when you are carrying out, or supervising, Restricted Building Work (RBW).
For example, you may supervise a non-licensed person to carry out RBW that you yourself are licenced in, but not for work within a different licence class – for instance, the blocklayer can’t supervise roofing work where it is RBW.
You must explain risks to your client
You must take all reasonable steps to discuss the design and construction risks of a project or approach with your client, and make sure that they understand the options available to mitigate those risks before the work begins. Where risks arise during the course or your work, you must, as soon as practicable, advise your client in writing.
The classic example of this would be the renovation of an older house. Even the most experienced builder can get caught out by something unexpected – rotten timber, loss of support to a structural component, or just previous poor workmanship.
It is up to you as a building expert to make the client aware of these issues and the associated costs involved in fixing it. It could also be a good time to explain the difference between fixed price and charge-up contracts, and which could potentially be best for both parties.
You must inform and educate your client
You are the building expert in most cases when dealing with a client. This means you must provide your client with sufficient information and advice to enable them to make an informed decision, so that you can carry on with your building work.
If you are unable to provide your client with the information or expertise required, then you may consider directing them to a suitable person, such as a designer, architect or engineer.
You must be accountable
In the event of defects caused by yourself or someone you supervise, you must take all reasonable steps to communicate with your client in an honest and responsive way, and act with integrity when resolving the problem.
You must advise clients of any delays as soon as they become apparent
You must keep your client up to date with progress on the work you are carrying out, or supervising, and give realistic timeframes and promptly notify them if these timeframes change (particularly in the case of delays).
You must advise the client about the reasons for delays and take effort to ensure delays can be prevented wherever possible. For instance, if you come across rotten timber or a rusted hidden gutter, let the client know as soon as you can. Always keep them up to date with progress and any potential delays.
You must act in your client’s interests
Your client is expecting a professional service and a finished product of an acceptable standard, so make sure any building work you conduct, or supervise, is up to an acceptable standard. Doing this will likely mean you get positive feedback from clients and may increase the amount of word-of-mouth work you get in the future.
You must normally follow your client’s instructions
The client is the end user of the work you are doing, so you should endeavour to follow their instructions. However, if those instructions are unlawful, dangerous to implement, or are contrary to any contracts or consents in place, you must discuss this with the client.
For example, the client asks you to add an extra metre onto the length of the addition while you are digging the footings. Can you do this ? Yes, but it would mean stopping the work, contacting the designer, and submitting an amendment to council, and there would be significant cost implications. The client may think that ‘it’s only a metre’, so you will need to explain these issues to them.

Timber joinery is a feature of New Zealand heritage architecture and is a relevant part of building and renovation today, but it’s important to know how and when to use it
Timber joinery products meet the requirements of the current Building Code, but there are several Standards to consider, so it’s important to use them accordingly. The following tried and trusted standards can give you confidence that you are following good practice.
Benefits of timber joinery
Timber joinery provides many benefits:
Higher thermal resistance compared to some commonly used building products.
Condensation is reduced or eliminated with double-glazed timber joinery.
Joinery details that closely mimic the traditional appearance of timber joinery allow replacement and renovation work to blend seamlessly.
Surface coatings that can be repaired relatively easily on site and colours that can be changed to suit the client’s needs.
Added design flexibility due to the relative ease in modifying timber profiles.
Reduced carbon footprint, as the product is manufactured from renewable timber resources and, with the proper maintenance, it can last 50-plus years.
Specify the right product for your job
In New Zealand, testing the weathertightness performance of individual windows and doors for external use is done using NZS 4211:2008 Specification for performance of windows . This standard also includes glazing systems.
Windows and doors that pass NZS 4211:2008 testing can be labelled as being in accordance with NZS 4211:2008 . This includes the appropriate air leakage and wind zone rating for the product, as established through the  testing.
Generally, when specifying windows and doors using NZS 4211:2008 , the following steps should be taken:
Establish the appropriate wind zone in accordance with NZS 3604:2011 Timber-framed buildings section 5.
If the wind zone is beyond that given in NZS 3604:2011 , see section 10 of NZS 4211:2008.
Select a window that has been tested to NZS 4211:2008 and is labelled as suitable for the relevant wind zone.
In May 2014, the wind zones in NZS 4211:2008 were revised to align with the wind zones specified in NZS 3604:2011 . This incorporates the extra-high wind zone for more exposed building sites.
Some NZS 4211:2008-compliant timber joinery suites have been tested beyond the extra-high wind zone, so specifying these can give you additional confidence in performance.
Easy to identify NZS 4211:2008-compliant joinery
It is easy to tell the difference between NZS 4211:2008- compliant timber joinery and other timber joinery. NZS 4211:2008 -compliant joinery will be fitted with identification tags that show relevant wind zone and air leakage ratings. See example of NZS4211:2008-compliant timber joinery tag below:
It also has a unique identification number that can be traced back to the original registered manufacturer. Tags are typically installed on the frame in the rebate of an operable door or window sash, like those found on fire doors.
Registered manufacturers of NZS 4211:2008-compliant timber joinery must work to a manufacturing standard to ensure quality. Structural members within the joinery are individually calculated using specialist software and engineered calculation charts. Timber species and size can be altered to ensure relevant wind zone requirements are met.
More information online
NZS 4211:2008 is one of the standards funded by the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) to support Building Code compliance. The NZS 4211:2008 standard can be downloaded free of charge on the Standards New Zealand website.
NZS 4211:2008 -compliant timber joinery product and installation details can also be downloaded from the Joinery Manufacturers’ Federation website.
The documents available on the website outline opening trim preparation, flashing details, fixing methods and seal locations. They will assist in both detailing and installing timber joinery to appropriate standards.

Stay up to speed with industry changes and building code clauses
P laceMakers ninth round of seminars is under way, and the focus on building code clauses – and their common compliance issues – is generating unprecedented discussion among attending builders.
Presenter John Tait, who has extensive experience as a building inspector, is using live examples to prompt builders to share their experience handling different situations.
This round focuses on fall safety, warning systems, and access routes.
“I expect builders to be a little surprised at what does and does not comply,” says John. “Come prepared to get involved in the discussion!”
Given that the Health and Safety Reform Bill has now passed, and changes to the skills maintenance scheme are starting from November, this round of seminars will include a review of the key concepts in the new WorkSafe Health and Safety at Work Act, as well as outlining the changes to LBP skills maintenance.
Contact your local PlaceMakers to register your interest and build on the skills maintenance points you’ve already earned through reading Under Construction .
Earlier this year, MBIE announced that the current requirements for the LBP skills maintenance scheme were set to change
The changes come into effect this month, on 2 November, at which point LBPs will start a gradual transition to the new skills maintenance scheme. The new framework moves away from an entirely points-based system in favour of a new ‘mixed-model’ approach, with the aim of promoting more meaningful and relevant learning for LBPs.
The new model will require LBPs to complete both compulsory and elective activities. Compulsory activities include reading LBP Knowledge articles in Codewords , completing a quiz after each article and demonstrating two examples of on-the-job learning. The elective part of the new scheme remains largely the same. Each hour of relevant elective activity equals 1 LBP point.
Although the new scheme officially starts on 2 November, LBPs are only required to transition to the new system once they renew their licence on or after the change date. For example, if you are required to submit your next skills maintenance form by 13 May 2016, you will continue to do activities and earn points under the current scheme until then. From 14 May 2016, you will transfer to the new scheme.

Updated references to standards and minor changes in the Acceptable Solutions and Verification Methods came into effect on 14 August 2014 – make sure you’re aware of the changes and incorporate them into your work!
To ‘build it right first time’ and stand behind the quality of your work, you need the right tools for the job.
Acceptable Solutions and Verification Methods published by the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment are some of those tools.
They are methods that, if followed, provide a sure way for a design to achieve a building consent. They are not the only way, but they are a direct way.
The Acceptable Solutions and Verification Methods often refer to Standards. This means that the design will need to follow the Standard, or the part of it, that it’s referred to.
The Ministry works to make sure that Acceptable Solutions and Verification Methods reflect the latest research, building practices and materials.
So, from time to time, the Ministry updates Acceptable Solutions and Verification Methods to refer to the latest versions of Standards.
The Ministry has changed a number of Acceptable Solutions and Verification Methods, so that they now refer to updated Standards. Following a consultation process, the Ministry published these changes on 14 February 2014.
A transition period of six months allowed both the old and the new solutions to be used. This transition period ended on 14 August 2014 – from that date, the old solutions are no longer effective and only the new solutions apply.
So, it’s important to make sure you are familiar with the new versions of the Acceptable Solutions and Verification Methods, which can be downloaded at www.dbh.govt.nz/compliance-documents .
Check out the summary below to see what areas have changed.
Keeping up to date with the latest tools helps make sure a design is Building Code compliant and can achieve a building consent.
Updated Standards can be purchased from Standards New Zealand, www.standards.co.nz and the latest Acceptable Solutions and Verification Methods can be downloaded at: www.dbh.govt.nz/compliance-documents .

Between hands-on construction, admin and life outside work, it’s hard to stay on top of industry changes, reviews, consultations and more. PlaceMakers’ fifth round of seminars promises to deliver as much info as possible in a clear and easy way.
PlaceMakers’ fifth round of skills maintenance seminars aims to keep builders up to date with the myriad of changes that have already taken place – and those potentially just around the corner.
The new presenter John Tait, who will be familiar to some of you as presenter of a number of seminars in the last skill maintenance series, brings years of varied building experience and a fresh perspective to PlaceMakers’ ongoing skills maintenance programme.
“Skill maintenance is about ensuring you’re aware of the industry changes that affect your work on a day-to-day basis and we’ll do our best to explain those in an easy-to-digest format – PlakeMakers’ seminar presenter John Tait
“Skills maintenance is about ensuring you’re aware of the industry changes that affect your work on a day-to-day basis and we’ll do our best to explain those in an easy-to-digest format,” says John.
Coming from a trade background, John holds a national diploma in construction management and has been in the industry for twenty years. He previously worked as a building inspector, a technical advisor for the Department of Building and Housing and even worked at PlaceMakers Evans Bay for seven years in the yard, panel store, hardware store and trade sales office.
John currently provides a range of building consultant services to owners and councils around the country and says he is looking forward to meeting attendees and helping them manage the significant changes still taking place in the construction industry.
Some of the aspects he’ll be focusing on include Building Act Amendment No 4, the Construction Contracts Act, the Earthquake Prone Building Policy, the Law Commission review of joint and several liability and a number of recent Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment guides such as the ‘Guidance on the use of Certificates of Work, Producer Statements and Design Features by Chartered Professional Engineers under the new Restricted Building Work regime’ and ‘External moisture – a guide to using the risk matrix’.
So, attend a seminar near you and build on the skills maintenance points you’ve been collecting by reading Under Construction.

It is widely acknowledged there is a shortage of apprentices in the construction industry. An initiative developed by the government will make it easier for employers to gauge the suitability of school leavers to their respective trades
Developed by the Ministry of Education in collaboration with industry and education, Vocational Pathways launched in April 2013 as part of the government’s Youth Guarantee initiative, to better align and prepare students for further study, training or work. Vocational Pathways is particularly useful for the construction industry. Students wanting a future in construction can identify their interest early; this also helps them build an appropriate skillset before beginning an apprenticeship – making it easier to shape them into future industry captains.
Approximately 70% of school leavers do not enter degree-level study, with many looking at alternative options and careers via a different route. Vocational Pathways provides a new way to structure and achieve NCEA Level 2. The pathways show how their learning is relevant for a wide range of jobs and study options in six broad sectors of industry.
“Increasing the number of young people leaving the education system with qualifications will make a positive contribution to the future labour market
As part of its Youth Guarantee programme, the government has set a target that 85% of 18-year-olds will have NCEA Level 2 or equivalent in 2017. Increasing the number of young people leaving the education system with qualifications will make a positive contribution to the future labour market. NCEA Level 2 is now regarded as the minimum qualification required to enter and progress to further study, training or work.
With more than 600 credits at Level 2 now structured and colour-coded within Vocational Pathways, learners can plan their journey from school to employment knowing what skills, attributes and knowledge they need to enter their chosen industry.
Learners use an online Profile Builder to plan a Vocational Pathway into a particular industry.
Achieving industry-related credits means learners are fully informed of what they need to achieve at school to progress to the type of work they are interested in.
“The next time you’re talking to a school leaver about an opportunity in your industry, ask to view their Vocational Profile
Once someone is studying at NZQA Level 2, they will have access to a Vocational Pathways Profile. This is a visual, colour-coded graph that shows their achievements against each Pathway.
The graphic makes it easier for employers to see a snapshot of industry-related achievements compared to a Record of Achievement, which is just a long list of unit standards.
This profile shows a student who has achieved standards in the construction and infrastructure (orange) industry
The next time you’re talking to a school leaver about an opportunity in your industry, ask to view their Vocational Profile. You can see what pathways they are interested in, and quickly assess how they relate to your business. If the learner has planned to enter the construction and infrastructure industries, their Pathways Profile (in orange) will show industry-relevant knowledge and skills.
Working closely with industries to provide support and meet training needs into the future, BCITO is geared up for an increase in trainee numbers and is eager to hear from any employers ready to begin taking on extra capacity. If you want someone young and fresh to help you out who’ll become a valuable member of your team and the industry give serious thought to hiring an apprentice now.  BCITO may even be able to help you find the most suitable candidate.
To learn more about apprenticeships and nationally recognised qualifications visit www.bcito.org.nz or phone BCITO on 0800 4 BCITO (422 486).
You can be sure that if someone has achieved a Vocational Pathway in your sector then they will have a strong base to help them succeed.
Detailed information for employers about the Vocational Pathways can be found at: www.youthguarantee.net.nz/vocational-pathways/employers

Almost half of the Licensed Building Practitioners who responded to MBIE’s annual survey want the scheme to become more qualification-based
M ore than 1,000 LBPs responded to the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment’s annual survey to find out what LBPs think of the scheme.
The survey showed that more than 80% of respondents want access to national standards included in their licence fee. Just over 5% disagreed, with the remainder either unsure or of no opinion.
Given the overwhelming response, MBIE is working towards finding a solution that would bring Licensed Building Practitioners better in line with other occupation licensing groups with access to standards.
MBIE – service could be better
Asked how satisfied they were with the overall quality of service delivery, more than 65% of the respondents said they were satisfied and over 25% said they were neutral on the issue.
Despite very few responding they were unsatisfied, MBIE said that more work is required to increase the number of positive responses.
Asked whether the scheme should move towards a qualification-based programme in the near future, nearly 50% said ‘yes’. Around 30% were ‘not sure’, with nearly 20% responding ‘no’.
The ministry noted that work is already under way to consider how the scheme might move to a fully qualification-based entry in the future.
Online tool on its way
An online Record of Work and Certificate of Work database is being developed by MBIE as part of the skills maintenance project and is expected to be released next year.
It will enable LBPs to complete the forms in a portal and remove the need for standard details to be re-entered each time a form is completed.
Close to 70% of respondents said they would use such a tool.
Better awareness needed
Just over half of the respondents said they felt clients were either ‘moderately aware’ or ‘very aware’ of the LBP scheme.
That was only slightly more than those who said customers were only ‘slightly aware’ or ‘not at all aware’ of the scheme.
While MBIE acknowledged more work was required to build the brand among customers, it reported that awareness has increased every year since the scheme’s introduction.

New seminar format well received by builders
PlaceMakers has once again been touring New Zealand, providing builders with the opportunity to get up to speed with industry changes – and earn elective skills maintenance points – by attending its latest round of skills maintenance seminars.
For this round of seminars, PlaceMakers allocated half the time to six speakers – three technical and three business-focused – to provide extra expertise, which has been well received by customers.
“Based on attendee feedback, all respondents found the session useful and the topics of relevance,” says Trade Engagement Manager Andrea Albertyn. “Some of the host branches reported an increase in attendance numbers compared to last year, with a couple of stores having to change their venue at the last minute to accommodate the extra numbers!”
The quick survey form, handed out after the completion of each session, measures how well the different presentations hit the mark.
The feedback is invaluable in helping identify what’s working and where improvements are needed, so trade customers can expect PlaceMakers to continue refreshing the LBP series to ensure attendees get maximum value in return for taking valuable time off the tools!

They say nothing happens overnight and it’s no different for Restricted Building Work (RBW) – one year on, licensed building practitioners (LBPs) still have plenty of questions surrounding the subtleties in RBW procedure and regulation.
Around 300 builders crowded the Working Men’s Club in Petone for PlaceMakers’ fourth round of skills maintenance seminars on RBW and the importance of Records of Work (ROW) memorandums.
Alongside presenter and industry expert Paul Alsford, building control managers Leonie Gibb (Hutt City Council), John Hudson (Upper Hutt City Council) and Chris Scott (Wellington City Council) fielded a number of questions on the RBW process and the repercussions of not providing a memorandum.
“We’re not policing the guys on site, we’re just there at the end to collect the memorandum,” said John. “The LBP system runs parallel to the consenting system and we’re at the end of that ensuring there are no gaps in the paperwork.”
Chris explained that gaps – portions of the build not signed off as completed or supervised by an LBP – will remain as marks against the property, which could be grounds for the homeowner to file a civil case against the project manager if it affects the sale of the house.
“To avoid this, it’s important to have everyone – builders and sub-contractors – lined up for each portion of the build before it begins and to be clear with the owner about what their responsibilities are,” said Leonie.
“If the owners are handling the project management then they need to have sub-contractors sign off their work – you don’t want them handing you the roofing memorandum and saying ‘the roofer said you’d sign this’.”
Ludlow Builders director Brian Ludlow, who has been builder for more than 40 years, says he is confident with the RBW process but feels attending a seminar where others might ask questions he hadn’t thought of is a great refresher.
“It’s a great reminder about how important it is to plot your building plan beforehand and make sure you’ve got the right LBPs on board and that the plumbing and electrical subbies are certified or registered,” he said. “There’s a lot more to to this business than just building; these seminars reinforce that.”
Leonie said she was glad for the opportunity to attend the seminar and encouraged builders to contact their local council with any questions.
“We’re here to assist. We’d prefer to answer questions rather than see guys get themselves in a difficult situation.”
Pre-planning is the key to managing Restricted Building Work. Be clear about what work you are contracted to do and what work, if any, you are contracted to supervise or collect RoW for. If this clear in the contract, there should be no assumptions or surprises.

The Building Practitioners Board’s annual report outlines a continuation of increased activity over the past 12 months, especially around dealing with complaints received by the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment
A s of 23 February 2017, the scheme had 30,305 licences issued to 25,305 individuals (some LBPs hold more than one licence). In the 2015/2016 financial year, 720 new licences were granted.
Increasing complaints
According to the report, the number of complaints received by the Board has increased by about 71% in the past year – likely due to increasing consumer awareness of the programme and increased residential construction activity.
Table 1: Complaints received in previous four years
In relation to LBP complaints, the Board identified a number of common themes:
The most dominant is the non-provision of records of work (RoW) memorandum. These are being withheld either out of ignorance or, in many cases, as leverage in a commercial dispute, neither of which are valid reasons.
Poor understanding and application of site supervision.
Undertaking work relating to general repair, maintenance and replacement as per Schedule 1 of the Building Act considered confusing to the industry at large. It is hoped that further Ministry-led guidance may reduce the number of complaints.
Complaints about LBPs issuing signed statements (which are supposed to give assurance that building work meets the Building Code) based on little or no factual basis are increasing.
Complaints that highlight the breakdown in the relationship between an LBP and the consumer where the LBP is replaced and a complaint made.
NOTE: Despite industry noise about the poor quality of design work, the Board has not received many complaints against designers.
Decisions on all these issues have been, and continue to be, made by the Board. The Board is encouraging LBPs to read these decisions so they can better understand how to avoid complaints in these areas.
Precedent-setting decisions
There have been a number of precedent-setting decisions this year, with the most significant ones relating to supervision.
Having taken into account Parliament’s intention in the Act, the Board decided that LBP supervision applies to work covered by a building consent AND non-consented work.
The Board also decided that, while the Act states an LBP cannot supervise another LBP of the same licensing class, if another LBP (employer) instructs an LBP to undertake work a certain way, and that work is subject to a complaint which is upheld, then the instructing LBP can be held to have carried out building work in their own right. While this does not fully address the power imbalance that exists between an employer and employee (as not all employers are LBPs), it is making those in positions of authority more accountable. The Board is also working with the Ministry to look at ways of further redressing this power imbalance.
Chairman of the Board, Chris Preston, says that now that the LBP scheme has been in place for a few years, there will be less leniency when it comes to decisions and repercussions.
“With respect to penalties handed down by the Board, the Board has, to date, taken the approach that the scheme is still relatively new and LBPs need the chance to fully understand their responsibilities,” said Preston in the report. “As such, the penalties imposed have been at the lower end, but it is the Board’s intention to increase these over the next year to make it clear that poor workmanship and behaviour will have its consequences. The time for leniency has ended.”
Complaints in numbers
One of the Board’s targets was to determine 80% of complaints within 85 working days of the date of the hearing. In the end, the Board surpassed its target, determining 100% of complaints within the timeframe. Another target was to determine 90% of appeals within 85 working days of receipt of a complaint appeal. This too was achieved, with the Board determining 95% of appeals within six months.
Of the total complaints/Board inquiries determined in 2015/16, 80 (82%) were upheld. The remaining 17 (18%) were not. Table2 details the licence classes held by LBPs who were disciplined.
The LBP scheme is a complex occupational licensing model with seven separate licence classes – six trade-related and one which deals with the design of certain residential buildings. When compared with the total number of licences in each license class, the proportion of LBPs disciplined per license class closely reflects the overall distribution.
Complaints by region Almost half of the penalties imposed by the Board are Auckland-based. This high volume is thought to be due to the quantity of work being undertaken in the wider Auckland area and the interrelated pressures on labour supply.
Canterbury also appears to be a growth area for complaints, up from 6% in 2014/2015 to 11% in 2015/2016. A substantial number of these complaints stemmed from a recently released report into the Building Code compliance (or lack thereof) of earthquake repairs to Canterbury homes.
The report followed an independent survey of 101 homes randomly selected from more than 2,700 addresses provided by EQC, Housing New Zealand and IAG. Once these potential acts of non-compliance were brought to the Board’s attention, it initiated inquiries into the LBPs in question.
Consequences
In 2015/2016, 89 penalties were imposed for 80 upheld complaints against LBPs. Some complaints had more than one penalty imposed. Possible penalties included having the LBP licence cancelled or suspended, getting fined, having their name published, being censured and/or being ordered to take training.
Looking ahead
Moving forward, the challenge for the Ministry, the Board and the sector as a whole is to lift the current levels of qualified entrants and work towards drawing a legislative ‘line in the sand’ for it to become an explicit requirement to hold a trade or design-related qualification to enter the scheme. This will be an important step in the scheme’s development and maturity.
You must provide a Record of Work once the building work is complete – whether you’ve been paid or not.
Supervising someone else’s work requires actual supervision of the work and makes the supervising LBP liable for its quality.
If in doubt, check it out! Don’t proceed with work if you suspect it might be non-compliant.

The Building Code is required to evolve over time to meet the needs of New Zealanders. To achieve this, the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) is holding biannual consultations and Building Code reviews
In New Zealand, building work must meet mandatory requirements. These are laid out in the Building Act 2004 and its supporting regulations – the Building Code.
The New Zealand Building Code is performance-based as opposed to prescriptive. A performance-based Building Code provides choice and flexibility in demonstrating compliance.
Options for demonstrating compliance
There are various compliance pathways that may be used to demonstrate that building work meets the minimum performance requirements set by the Building Code.
Compliance pathways that must be accepted as complying with the Building Code include:
Acceptable Solutions – simple stepby-step instructions that describe specific solutions for complying with the Building Code.
Verification Methods – test or calculation methods for complying with the Building Code.
The Building Code, Acceptable Solutions and Verification Methods documents require updating regularly to remain current with sector innovations and best practice.
Consulting on change
MBIE consults on the Building Code twice a year – every February/ March and August/September. The consultation runs for six weeks and stakeholders are invited to make submissions through the MBIE website on a range of issues raised for discussion.
After the consultation closes and all submissions are analysed, Acceptable Solutions and Verification Methods are updated and published in June and November each year.
The purpose of these biannual updates is to ensure effective administration of the Building Code documents. MBIE is committed to updating these documents twice a year, so that the Building Code keeps pace with innovation, current construction methods and the needs of modern society. It also provides clarity, certainty and consistency to the building and construction sector.
The first biannual update changes were published in November 2018, followed by a second set in June 2019. The most recent round was published in November 2019.
Latest changes
The November 2019 changes are to:
Support safer and more resilient foundations for buildings on liquefaction-prone ground.
Improve consenting efficiency for steel-framed housing by introducing a new steel frame Acceptable Solution.
The change to foundation requirements on liquefaction-prone ground is already in place in the Canterbury region and will now be extended to all of New Zealand. This will provide clarity to both councils and engineers, ensuring new buildings are being built safely and strongly enough to withstand liquefaction risks.
MBIE is also making the National Association of Steel Framed Housing (NASH) standard an Acceptable Solution rather than an Alternative Solution. This will help support higher density housing by increasing the number of  construction material options available in compliance pathways.
More information
For more information you can check out the updated Acceptable Solutions and Verification Methods on the Building Performance website. If you would like to receive email updates on changes to the Building Code and when  consultations are open, information is available here .
This article is an excerpt from Codewords Issue 94. Reading Codewords articles that are relevant to your licence class is a mandatory requirement for Licensed Building Practitioners. These questions can be answered through the LBP portal, online at underconstruction.placemakers.co.nz or recorded on the magazine, then provided at the time of renewal.

Under Construction looks to further clarify the details of the Construction Contracts Amendment Act 2015 retentions trust regime
S ince the passing of the Construction Contracts Amendment Act (CCAA) in 2015, the construction industry had been waiting to find out the details of the retentions trust regime.
With 31 March come and gone, the CCAA is now in its final form – after some eleventh-hour amendments. We’ve covered the new regulations extensively over the past few months, but builders have told us that some aspects are still unclear.
With that in mind, we’ve gone into further detail about the retentions trust regime and the most recent changes.
The main change
By far the most controversial change under the CCAA requires that all retention money withheld by a party (Company A, usually a principal or head contractor) from another (Company B, usually a contractor or subcontractor) is deemed to be held on trust.
This applies to all commercial construction contracts where the retentions are above a minimum amount. However, after consulting the building industry in 2016, MBIE decided not to specify a minimum amount. This means that the retention money provisions will apply regardless of the amount of money involved.
The purpose of the retentions trust regime is to protect retention funds in the event of an insolvency event, such as occurred with Mainzeal.
Trust funds receive special status in a receivership, liquidation or bankruptcy, as they are not the property of the party holding them. This means in Company A’s insolvency, Company B will have a claim to the retention funds above other creditors, including the IRD and banks.
Managing the funds
The CCAA specifies how Company A can hold and use the retained sums. The funds must be held as cash, or another liquid asset readily convertible into cash. Company A can invest the retentions money held, so long as they uphold their obligations under the Trustee Act 1956 (and the investment remains readily convertible into cash). Company A will be entitled to keep any benefit of this investment, but must make up for any shortfall.
Company A will also be allowed to co-mingle the retention monies in their current accounts – in other words, with Company A’s working capital. Some industry experts have expressed concerns about this, as from a trust management perspective it is not the best practice and erodes away the protections offered by a trust.
The CCAA also prescribes record-keeping requirements for the retention funds. These requirements mirror those contained in the Companies Act and will be familiar to accountants.
The CCAA provides that Company B may request a copy of the records pertaining to the trust funds they are the beneficiary of. This is a useful tool for Company B to use to ensure Company A is upholding their obligations.
Company A may only use the retention funds to remedy defects in the performance of Company B’s obligations under the contract, and they must be paid once Party B has performed all its obligations under the contract to the agreed standard. A contract clause that delays this payment, or makes it conditional, will be void.
Regulatory amendment
After years of anxious anticipation within the industry, the NZ government finally released an amendment contained within the Regulatory Systems (Commercial Matters) Amendment Bill.
The amendment clarified an ambiguity in the CCAA by confirming that the retentions regime would apply only to contracts entered into or renewed after 31 March 2017 (rather than all existing contracts as it initially appeared).
Also, in March 2017, less than a month before the regime was to come into force, an alternative to the regime was offered.
Retention alternative
The alternative allows Company A to sidestep the retention trust requirements, if they take out a ‘complying instrument’. Company A is not required to hold Company B’s funds on trust, if Company A takes out an instrument that adheres to the following criteria. The instrument must be:
Issued by a licensed insurer, registered bank, or any other person/entity prescribed by regulations.
Issued in favour of Company B or endorsed with Company B’s interest.
A means of securing for Party B payment of retentions should Company A fail to do so.
The instrument can take any form, provided it complies with the above – the examples given are insurance, bonds and guarantees. However, the retentions trust regime is still the default position.

Under Construction now includes all compulsory Codewords articles to help LBPs stay up to speed and earn their required points. This month’s article is required for those who hold a Carpentry, Foundations, Site or Design licence
Under the new skills maintenance scheme, reading Codewords articles relevant to your licence and answering the corresponding questions is a mandatory part of skills maintenance (for those who have renewed their licence since 2 November 2015).
This month, Under Construction is featuring Codewords’ article about the new Standard for installing insulation.
Once you’ve read the article, go to the LBP website (under Codewords Issue 75) to answer the associated questions.
Installing insulation in residential buildings
The New Zealand Standard for installing insulation in residential buildings has gone through a major revision. The new Standard is NZS 4246:2016 Energy efficiency – Installing bulk thermal insulation in residential buildings. This replaces NZS 4246:2006 Energy efficiency – Installing insulation in residential buildings.
The Standard provides guidance for the correct installation of insulation products by any installer, including DIY installers, in order to achieve high-quality and safe insulation installations in buildings.
How has the standard changed?
The Standard has been updated, extended and now provides additional guidance on installing insulation:
• In steel-framed installations.
• Under concrete slabs on the ground.
• Around downlights, particularly where there have been significant technology advances.
Additional diagrams, photos and figures have been included to provide easyto- understand, step-by-step guidelines for installing insulation in new homes, and for retrofitting insulation in existing residential buildings.
Products and applications covered include:
• Loose-fill product (such as wool, mineral wool or cellulose fibre) for insulating walls and ceilings.
• Segment and blanket products (such as polyester, wool or mineral wool) for insulating in walls, ceilings and floors.
• Rigid sheet insulation products (such as expanded or extruded polystyrene (eps or xps) and polyisocyanurate (pir) for insulating walls, ceilings and floors).
• Semi-rigid insulation (such as wool, mineral wool, polyester) for insulating walls, ceilings and floors.
• Pipe insulation (such as pre-formed tubular foam).
• Hot water cylinder wraps (such as wool, mineral wool or polyester blanket with cloth or foil-backing).
• On-ground vapour barriers.
Ban on foil insulation (retrofit or replacement)
Foil insulation continues to be excluded from the scope of the revised Standard. A ban on retrofitting or replacing foil insulation in residential properties came into force on 1 July 2016 to reduce safety risks associated with installing this product. Read more on the ban on installing or repairing foil insulation in residential buildings on the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment’s (MBIE) Building Services website.
Meeting everyone’s needs
Installing insulation correctly means it performs effectively and doesn’t compromise the durability of your building, or put the health and safety of installers and occupants at serious risk. In addition, the Standard is cited in the Residential Tenancies (Smoke Alarms and Insulation) Regulations 2016. If you have rental properties it’s important you read and comply with the Standard when installing insulation in those properties.
Where to find the revised standard
The revision of the Standard was commissioned by the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority and is publicly available on MBIE’s Tenancy Services website. To download the Standard, go to the homepage, select ‘Maintenance & inspections’, then ‘Insulation’. At the bottom of the page there is a link to a PDF of the Standard.

MBIE’s latest guidance aims to resolve common areas of dispute between contractors and homeowners
The Guide to Tolerances, Materials and Workmanship in New Residential Construction is now available. Prepared by the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE), it aims to assist contractors and homeowners, who may be unsure of what constitutes a defect within the Building Act 2004.
This guide focuses on issues that can lead to disputes between building contractors and homeowners but fall outside the Building Code, contract documentation and manufacturers’ specifications and installation instructions. It outlines what constitutes acceptable levels of workmanship in standard domestic construction types under normal conditions, and is targeted at new residential building work.
The guidance was written with advice from the industry and supports the new consumer protection measures in Part 4A of the Building Act, which came into law on 1 January.
Under the new consumer protection measures, a 12-month defect repair period starts from:
the completion of the building work under a written contract, or
the completion of the physical building work in cases where there is no written contract.
During this time, it is the main contractors’ responsibility to fix any defects that they are notified of within a reasonable amount of time, or prove that any defective building work is through no fault of their own, the subcontractors under their control, or the products supplied if there is a dispute.
The Guide to Tolerances, Materials and Workmanship in New Residential Construction covers mainly aesthetic issues (eg, what is considered a reasonable slope in a floor, or what is an acceptable appearance for a newly painted wall) in new builds and additions at any price, whether or not the consumer protection measures and $30,000 threshold apply.
The guide does not cover tolerances for repairs, renovations, or alterations within existing buildings. Tolerances for existing buildings are likely to be below those achievable with new buildings. There are a number of reasons for this, including the nature of the materials used in existing buildings and the effects of both time and natural events.
The guide is also a great tool to make sure clients understand and agree what acceptable levels of tolerances, materials and workmanship are for new residential building work. It can be used before contracts are signed to help align expectations of quality with choice of design, materials, finishes and costs.
The Guide to Tolerances, Materials and Workmanship in New Residential Construction is not a mandatory set of standards. Contractors and clients can mutually agree to their own expectations, preferably within their written contract.
The Guide to Tolerances, Materials and Workmanship in New Residential Construction is concerned with defects that fall within section 362Q of the Building Act (ie, those that a contractor would be required to remedy within a reasonable amount of time if notified within one year of completion of the building work). A defect can be defined in a number of ways, including:
Non-compliance with the Building Code.
Non-agreed variations from consented drawings.
Failure to meet agreed contractual specifications.
Premature product failure.
This guide focuses on failure to achieve acceptable industry levels of quality or performance on items not covered by the first four bullet points.
What constitutes a defect will change over time with fair wear and tear, settlement, weathering, and ageing of materials. Therefore, what may be a defect at handover may not constitute a defect after 12 months. For example, deep scratching to a polished wood floor is a defect at handover, but may not be several months later due to fair wear and tear.
If the owner believes they have identified a defect, they should talk to their building contractor in the first instance about the issue and how to resolve it.
If the contract, specifications and consent documentation do not provide sufficient information to enable the owner and building contractor to agree, the issue may be covered by an existing New Zealand Standard, industry code of practice or this guide. Where an issue is raised that is not covered by any of these sources of information, professional advice may be needed to establish if the issue is a defect and how it should be rectified.
If the defect is suspected or known to be a Building Code compliance issue, the next step should be to contact the relevant council that issued the building consent or code compliance certificate. For issues relating to the contract, seek independent legal advice. It is common for variations (both minor and major) to occur during a construction project. It is important the owner’s instructions or agreement to variations proposed by the designer or building contractor are recorded, to avoid differences in expectations and potential disputes.
While the building contractor is required to remedy defects notified within one year of completion of the building work, the building contractor is able to pursue the usual routes of redress for faulty products or sub-standard workmanship of subcontractors. However, section 362M of the Building Act requires defects to be remediated within a reasonable amount of time.

What you need to know when repairing flood damaged buildings and carrying out work under the schedule 1 exemptions of the Building Act
The severe weather events that hit many regions across Aotearoa New Zealand in 2023 resulted in damage to thousands of buildings. Remediation and recovery work continues.
Before you start
Before you start repair or remediation work on buildings affected by flooding, you should:
Ensure the building is safe to enter.
Take photos before and during the work.
Take appropriate health and safety precautions, including wearing safety gear and ensuring power and gas are turned off.
Ensure that the sewerage system has been checked and presents no risk to health. Floodwater may be contaminated by silt and sewerage that is deposited as water recedes.
Check your local council’s website for current guidance for repair work, if any.
MBIE has produced some guidance that may help, such as:
Starting the work
Once you know what work is needed, you should check if it needs a building consent.
If a building consent is required, your client must obtain this before you start the work. If the work needs to be done urgently to save or protect people’s lives or health, or to remove a risk of serious damage to property, you should contact your local council. They will be able to advise you if you can proceed with the work and apply for a certificate of acceptance after the immediate danger has been removed or reduced.
All work must comply with the Building Code to the extent required by the Building Act, even if a building consent is not required.
Schedule 1 exemptions of the building act
The list of building work that does not require a building consent is provided under Schedule 1 of the Building Act and includes specific conditions to manage risk.
When you start repair work, you may find that the extent of the damage is larger than you originally thought. In that situation a building consent may be required, so you should contact the property owner and local council to discuss.
Some of the exemptions that may apply to remediating flood damaged buildings are:
1. Territorial and regional authority discretionary exemptions
This exemption allows local councils to use their discretion to exempt any proposed building work if it complies with the Building Code and is unlikely to endanger people or buildings. This discretion can be used to exempt proposed building work from the requirement to obtain a building consent if:
The completed building work is likely to comply with the Building Code, or
If the completed building work does not comply with the Building Code, it is unlikely to endanger people or any building, whether on the same land or another property.
2. General repair, maintenance and replacement
This exemption allows building owners to maintain their buildings (including carrying out any repairs or replacement) without having to get a building consent.
The following can be repaired, maintained and replaced if comparable building products or assembly is used, and, in the case of a replacement, it is in the same position:
Building products.
Assemblies incorporated in or associated with a building.
This clause cannot be used if a complete or substantial replacement of a specified system is required, or the product contributes to the building’s structural behaviour or fire safety properties.
3. Internal walls and doorways in an existing building
Building work in connection with an internal wall (including an internal doorway) in any existing building doesn’t usually need a building consent unless the wall is any of the following:
Load bearing.
A bracing element.
A fire separation wall (also known as a firewall).
Part of a specified system.
Made of brick, stone, concrete (or similar) joined with mortar.
4. Repair and replacement of plasterboard due to flooding
When a flooding emergency happens and walls have been damaged, it is likely that the plasterboard will need to be partially or completely replaced.
It can be difficult to identify the type or purpose of plasterboard without expert knowledge or information. The building consent plans will usually show where the different types of plasterboard are located, and these plans, if available, can be obtained from your local council.
To help identify the type of plasterboard, you can take photos of the fixings and any information on the back of the plasterboard if you remove it, or you may be able to find out the use and purpose based on its location.
If you are unsure, it is safer to treat all plasterboard as if it is a bracing element and take appropriate measures to repair it.
Before starting repairs, it is important that any cavity spaces, such as between cladding and building wrap where silt and other contaminants may have collected, have been cleared out, and that all timber framing is dry and in good condition.
Consider the safety risks to yourself and others. Make sure you and anyone working on your behalf have the correct equipment and resources.
What information do you need to provide
You may need to provide a record confirming what work has been completed. The information could consist of a written or drawn record of the repair, a producer statement for construction work (PS3), certificates from any specialist trades such as electrical certificates of compliance, or a Record of Work for any Restricted Building Work completed.
This information should be provided to the property owner, and if the work is done under a building consent, the record of work must also be provided to the local council.
Reading Codewords articles that are relevant to your licence class is a mandatory requirement for Licensed Building Practitioners. These questions can be answered through the LBP portal, online on the Under Construction website or recorded on the magazine, then provided at the time of renewal.

Minister for Building and Construction Jenny Salesa announced on 24 May that new building consent exemptions are being added to the Building Act, meaning that more building work will be able to take place without a building consent
Allowing more building work to take place without a building consent is intended to make the building process quicker, easier and less expensive for builders and DIYers, while also allowing councils to focus on building work that is higher risk.
It is expected that the changes could save building owners up to $18 million a year in consenting costs and, if lodged separately, could reduce the number of consents issued by councils by up to 9,000 per year. This could save builders valuable time, as their consents for higher-risk jobs may be processed more quickly and they can carry out smaller jobs without needing to request or wait for a consent.
While some of the new building consent exemptions can be done without the help of a professional, others will require the involvement of a Chartered Professional Engineer or Licensed Building Practitioner.
STAKEHOLDER SUPPORTED
During the consultation process last year, MBIE received positive feedback from a range of stakeholders, including councils, industry organisations and building owner groups about increasing the number of building consent exemptions, covering work carried out in both rural and urban areas.
Following Government decisions, the scope of the single-storey detached building exemption has been expanded and there is now more building work which can be designed and carried out or supervised and signed off by a Licensed Building Practitioner without needing a building consent.
SUMMARY OF NEW EXEMPTIONS
Building consents will no longer be needed for a number of new or expanded types of low-risk building work, such as sleep-outs, sheds, carports, outdoor fireplaces and ground-mounted solar panels.
A summary of each is provided below:
Single-storey detached buildings (eg, sleep outs, sheds and greenhouses)
There will be additional exemptions that increase the size of the current exemption (available online):
Kitset or prefab buildings with a maximum floor area of 30m2, where a manufacturer or supplier has had the design carried out or reviewed by a Chartered Professional Engineer.
Buildings with a maximum floor area of 30m2, where a Licensed Building Practitioner is to carry out or supervise design and construction.
Buildings with a maximum floor area of 30m2, where only lightweight materials with structural components built in accordance to Building Code compliance B1/AS1 are used, and this work may be done without the help of a professional.
Ground-mounted solar array panels (in both rural and urban zones)
In urban zones, there will be an exemption for panels up to 20m2, which can be built without the help of a professional.
In urban zones, there will be an exemption for panels up to 40m2, where the design has been carried out or reviewed by a Chartered Professional Engineer.
In rural zones, there will be an exemption with no restrictions in panel size, which can be built without the help of a professional.
Carports up to 40m2
There will be two additional exemptions that increase the size of the building work from the current exemption:
The design has been carried out or reviewed by a Chartered Professional Engineer.
A Licensed Building Practitioner has carried out or supervised design and construction.
Ground floor awnings up to 30m2
There will be two additional exemptions that increase the size of the building work from the current exemption:
The design has been carried out or reviewed by a Chartered Professional Engineer.
A Licensed Building Practitioner has carried out or supervised design and construction.
Ground floor verandas and porches up to 30m2
There will be two additional exemptions that increase the size of the building work from the current exemption:
The design has been carried out or reviewed by a Chartered Professional Engineer.
A Licensed Building Practitioner has carried out or supervised design and construction.
Outdoor fireplaces or ovens
With a maximum height of 2.5m, and maximum cooking surface of 1m2.
Flexible water storage bladders
For irrigation or firefighting purposes up to 200,000 litres in storage capacity.
Small pipe supporting structures
For water only and on private land.
Short-span (small) bridges
Which the general public cannot access and does not span on a road or rail area. The design will need to be carried out or reviewed by a Chartered Professional Engineer.
Single-storey pole sheds and hay barns in rural zones
There will be two exemptions:
The design has been carried out or reviewed by a Chartered Professional Engineer
A Licensed Building Practitioner has carried out or supervised design and construction.
NEXT STEPS AND TIMINGS
More information about the new exemptions, including technical requirements will be on building.govt.nz in August. It is expected that LBP technical requirements will be on the website later this year.

Following on from the History of LBP series, this article looks into what continued professional development (CPD) looks like. In the Licensed Building Practitioner (LBP) scheme, we know this as skills maintenance
As an LBP, you need to keep up to date with changing industry practices and regulatory changes. This is done by completing and recording skills maintenance activities — learning activities that help make sure you continue to meet the minimum standard required to keep your licence or licences.
This requirement isn’t unique to LBPs. Most professional associations have a CPD programme of some kind to ensure members are kept up to date. Can you imagine going to an architect or engineer and getting advice that was current when they trained 30 years ago ? And there’s the medical industry, airline pilots, your accountant, building consent officers – you’d really expect them to be up to speed with current legislation and practices to earn your hard-earned cash, wouldn’t you ? This is exactly what your client is expecting of you.
All LBPs must complete a set of skills maintenance, which combines both compulsory and elective activities, every two years.
A lot of keeping up with the play is naturally occurring – you’re in the industry carrying out your job every day, so you’re bound to pick things up from the plans or see one of your workmates doing something differently. This is what the boss was talking about when you first started work – “you’ll learn something new every day on site…”.
And skills maintenance isn’t just about laying one brick on top of another or drafting a plan. If something you do improves efficiency in your work or the running of your business, your dealings with customers or workmates, or provides a more cooperative and inclusive working environment, it’s going to be beneficial to the customer, to you and to the industry. As a result, it would be considered skills maintenance.
As mentioned above, skills maintenance is divided into compulsory and mandatory activities.
The compulsory activities – reading specified articles and answering quizzes for the licence classes you hold, and two examples of on-the-job learning – are the same for all licences held.
Elective activities can be any activities useful to you and your work, and the number of hours required depends on the type of licence. According to lbp.govt.nz, the activities must relate to learning activities you’ve carried out — not just things that you’ve done — and they must be relevant to your licence class. However, as explained below, that does not necessarily mean trade-specific.
Design, site and carpentry
For carpentry and site practitioners, finding learning opportunities that count as skills maintenance is relatively easy – there is always a new product, system, or installation instruction on site. It may be a bespoke engineering detail or architectural feature, which requires them to explain exactly what they want. This may not be a discussion you’re personally involved in, but the message will be relayed to you if you’re doing the job, so there’s good skills maintenance there. This discussion is great for one of your on-the-job learning examples – remember to keep a copy of the detail off the plans and any instructions from the designer as evidence.
It could even be that the building or safety inspector has a discussion with you regarding an incorrect installation or a potential hazard you hadn’t picked up on – this could also count as on-the-job learning.
Design LBPs have a far more stringent CPD regime than skills maintenance if they belong to a professional organisation. Robyn McArthur of Architectural Designers New Zealand (ADNZ) shares some of the CPD activities their members undertake:
A vast selection of supplier’s webinars and films.
Superhome events such as bus tours (working towards more healthy and efficient homes).
Tuelo talks, pods, and Notion Flo webinars (Teulo Ltd is an online education platform)
Passive House (PHINZ) events.
Engineering New Zealand (ENZ) – engineer involvement in their projects.
Manufacturer seminars.
Roofing, plastering, brick and blocklaying and foundations For our specialist trade practitioners, it becomes somewhat more difficult to find, or recognise learning opportunities, especially as there is not an abundance of new products entering this market.
Brian Miller, on behalf of the Master Brick and Blocklayers Association, provided the following four key elements, which aren’t necessarily trade specific, that the organisation believes are necessary to ensure a competent and enduring tradesperson in the sector:
Current competency – technical compliance and keeping current, being aware of dimensional and composition changes in products to ensure accurate and aesthetically correct installation.
Core business skills such as operational costs, employment law, and financial acumen for businesses and contractors.
Health and safety – a wider focus on wellbeing in addition to site-specific requirements.
Future proofing the industry – taking on apprentices and being fully involved in their training. The Association is introducing access for apprentices with an education package which includes webinars and a site verification app to improve the efficient compliance certification of installation work, all at no cost.
Graham Moor, CEO of the Roofing Association of New Zealand, agrees that CPD doesn’t always need to be trade specific – there are many softer skills that will fit the criteria of improving site awareness and the client’s experience during the disruption in their space while you are working there.
For dealing with the customer, his suggestions are:
Knowledge of the requirements under the Consumer Guarantees and Fair Trading Acts.
Customer service awareness.
Dispute resolution courses.
For a cohesive worksite, which also enhances the customer’s experience, his suggestions are:
Cultural awareness, given the mix of ethnicities and cultures found on sites today.
Mental health – the building industry has some of the highest suicide rates in NZ. Join Mates in Construction or one of the many organisations active in this field.
Employment law – and this is for employers, employees and contractors alike. Know what’s required and what’s fair.
As exemplified above, industry associations are there to keep you up to date and current, using webinars, newsletters, magazines, conferences, workshops, seminars, competitions, etc. Although belonging to an association has a small cost, the benefits are worth it not only for your skills maintenance requirements, but also for your own personal growth.
Visit lbp.govt.nz for more information and guidance on skills maintenance, especially under ‘On-the-job-learning’.
This article is an excerpt from Codewords Issue 106. Reading Codewords articles that are relevant to your licence class is a mandatory requirement for Licensed Building Practitioners.

The Building Amendment Act 2013 expands the range of work not requiring a building consent, imposes higher penalties for work done without the building consent, and more…
Recent changes to the Building Act, reflected in the Building Amendment Act 2013 that became law on 28 November 2013, will affect building contractors and homeowners across the country. Some changes came into force immediately, while others will come into effect throughout 2014.
They include changes to the types of work that do not require a building consent, making more low-risk work exempt and imposing limits on potentially high-risk work.
You will now be able to demolish a detached building that is not more than three storeys high without building consent. Previously, you could only do this if the building was damaged. This change means, for example, that an old, single-storey detached bach may be demolished to make way for a new dream home without applying for building consent. The new dream home will require building consent, though!
It’s also okay to remove a building element without building consent, such as the upper part of a brick chimney that is protruding above the roof, provided it is not more than three storeys and the removal does not affect the primary structure of the building, any specified system or any fire separation.
Some existing outbuildings not used by the public, such as carports, garages, greenhouses and sheds that are one storey or smaller, can be repaired and replaced without building consent, whether they are damaged or not, as long as the new outbuilding is the same size or smaller than the original, and is on the same footprint and is comparable to the original. You can’t, for example, replace a carport with a garage without building consent, nor can you shift a shed to another part of your property and add an extension without building consent.
Exempt building work is listed in Schedule 1 of the Act, which has been reformatted to make it easier to navigate.
The first part lists exempt building work with no limitations on who designs or carries out the work.
The second part deals with exempt sanitary plumbing and drainlaying, which must be carried out by people authorised under the Plumbers, Gasfitters and Drainlayers Act, with some exceptions.
The third part covers building work which has been designed or reviewed by a chartered professional engineer.
“All building work, whether exemptor consented, must comply with the Building Code
MBIE’s guidance document will contain examples of the kind of work that is exempt and examples of work that requires building consent.
The guidance will also advise readers to seek good advice on any building work, before they start. It will remind readers that all building work, whether exempt or consented, must comply with the Building Code and that any alterations or additions to an existing building must not adversely affect the building’s compliance with the Building Code.
Refer to Schedule 1 of the Act for details of work that can be done without building consent.Other immediate changes to the Act include: Higher penalties for work done without a building consent.
Higher penalties for work done without a building consent.
Councils have more powers to restrict entry to buildings that are near dangerous buildings.
The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) has more power to hold building consent authorities to account.
There have been changes to the way dams are defined and measured.
Changes that come into effect later next year include new regulations to protect consumers, who are building a house or making major renovations to their home.
Building contractors will have to give consumers information about their skills, qualifications, licensing status and business record when they are engaged to build a house or extension. Contractors will have to provide written contracts for work over a certain sum and can be fined if they don’t comply with the law. Details of what information will have to be given and what has to be included in the written contracts will be sorted in regulation yet to be written.
There will be a 12-month ‘defect repair period’ when building contractors oron-sellers will have to remedy any defects they have been told about. If the contractor disagrees, the burden of proof is on he/she to demonstrate their work is not defective.MBIE will develop the regulations over the coming months.
For more details about the Building Amendment Act 2013 and to read the exempt building work for yourself, go to http://www.dbh.govt.nz/building-amendment-act-2013, where you can download a fact sheet or read key information.
While exempt building work does not require a consent, that doesn’t meant that it does not have to comply with the Building Code. All building work – carried out by Licencesed Building Practitioners, homeowners or builders who are not licensed – must comply with the Building Code. If you’re not sure, using an Acceptable Solution is one way to ensure the building work complies.

On average, 5% of LBPs have their licence suspended every month simply because they haven’t renewed it.
While a number of Licensed Building Practitioners (LBPs) have been relicensed once or twice already; a surprising number are not renewing their licences on time and, as a result, about 5% are having them suspended every month!
Having your licence suspended stays on your public register record for three years, with the ‘Grounds for Suspension’ description stating: “Failure to comply with the conditions of licensing set out in section 293 of the Building Act 2004”.
In addition, if your licence is suspended, you cannot promote yourself as an LBP or carry out Restricted Building Work without being supervised and having your work signed off by an LBP with a current licence.
If you do not have the funds to pay your re-licensing fees, or are not currently practising, you can voluntarily suspend your licence and it will not affect your public register record. You can do this by filling out the form on the LBP website – www.lbp.govt.nz – under ‘I am an LBP’.
So, to avoid having your licence suspended, check the expiry date on your LBP card and record it in your diary!
To get relicensed you must:
Earn the minimum number of points over 24 months specified in your licence class.
Record your activities and claim one point for every hour of learning.
If you hold two or more licensing classes, you need the higher point allocation. For example, if you are licensed in Carpentry and Site and Design – area of practice 2, you need 36 points.
You can update your skills maintenance records using the LBP online system or by recording your points in your work diary. If you choose the latter, you will need to update the ‘record of skills maintenance form’. When due, the Registrar will attach the ‘record of skills maintenance form’ with your annual relicensing.
Remember – using the online system, or updating your work diary as you go, is a great way to avoid last-minute panic trying to remember what you’ve done over the past 24 months.
The Building Practitioners Board might ask to see evidence of your skills maintenance, so keep receipts and other evidence that shows what you’ve done. You should keep this evidence for a minimum of two years or longer, depending on your circumstances.
Coupons from the back of Under Construction .
Tertiary education – certificates or record of learning certificates.
Emails, faxes or letters from the person who organised or paid for the activity.
Pages printed from a website (or a URL noted).
Handouts or meeting agendas.
Photocopies of a DVD case or other learning tools.
Seminar flyers or notices.
Details on materials you have read e.g, issue and title.
Documentation about on-the-job training (eg, induction, mentoring, or supervising an apprentice).
As long as you can reasonably show you did the activity, it is up to you to decide whether you keep a record. It’s a good idea to sign and date your evidence – if it doesn’t already have a date on it – and photocopy it where necessary
Having your licence suspended appears as above on your public register for three years.

New and amended regulations came into force on 30 September to better clarify a ‘minor variation’ when it comes to amending a building consent and a ‘minor customisation’ when it comes to a MultiProof
The Government made this change in August 2024. The changes address some of the recommendations in the Commerce Commissioner’s market study into residential building supplies related to product substitution and variations.
Minor vs major
After a project gets a building consent and begins, it is possible that some building products specified in the plans are not available. In this situation, you can make a change to your consented plan without impacting the consent, as long as the change is minor and does not affect compliance with the Building Code. This is known as a ‘minor variation’ for building projects and a ‘minor customisation’ when it is applied to a MultiProof.
Building consent authorities (BCAs) will still assess changes to ensure the building will comply with the Building Code but people won’t need to submit an amendment for a building consent for minor, straightforward product or design changes.
The problem comes when there is disagreement (usually between a builder or designer and a BCA) about whether a change is ‘minor’, or whether it needs to be dealt with under the ‘major variation’ rules, which require a building consent to be re-submitted.
The difference between a minor and major variation can be extensive in terms of time and cost involved, so it is important that all parties can agree on the scope of the variation.
A closer look at the clarification
Minor variations are covered by the Building (Minor Variations) Regulations 2009, which forms part of the Building Act 2004. Under the change, these regulations have had three new parts added to make them clearer:
The substitution of a comparable product is a minor variation if—
A. The products achieve an equivalent level of performance, having regard to their design, installation, intended use, and maintenance; and B. It is not likely to affect the compliance of other parts of the building work with the building code; and C. The consequences of a building failure due to the product substitution would not be significantly worse than a building failure caused by the failure of the original product.
These sections are additional to the current minor variation definition, which simply says that a variation must not ‘deviate significantly’ from the original plans and specifications.
Planning for potential variations in advance
Building consent application forms have been changed to allow builders and designers to specify alternative products in advance. This is optional and will allow you to specify comparable building products in advance so an alternative will be pre-approved and ready to go without a variation needed, if needed.
This allows for improved efficiency in the building consent process and encourages competition for building products – especially around supply and availability.
Minor customisations for MultiProof
For Licensed Building Practitioners (LBPs) designing MultiProof projects involving restricted building work, the regulation changes also impact ‘minor customisations’. MultiProof enables fast-tracked building consents for pre-approved building designs. The inclusion of a definition for minor customisation now gives homeowners and builders some flexibility to make personal choices about a build without sacrificing the benefit of a pre-approved building design.
The bigger picture
Updating the regulations around the definition of a minor variation may help to speed up consenting and improve efficiency. Other changes already announced in this space include:
• Mandating the acceptance and use of overseas building products. • Increasing the uptake of remote virtual inspections. • Reducing the cost of the building levy. • Improving the monitoring of the building consent system, including publishing data quarterly.
This article is an excerpt from Codewords Issue 121. Reading Codewords articles that are relevant to your licence class is a mandatory requirement for Licensed Building Practitioners. These questions can be answered through the LBP portal, online on the Under Construction website or recorded on the magazine, then provided at the time of renewal.

TITLE   : CARPORTS WITHOUT CONSENTS

From 31 August 2020, a range of new and extended building consent exemptions were added to Schedule One of the Building Act, including a range of options for building carports. Read below to find out more about what is and isn’t included in the exemptions
Several of the new and extended exemptions require the assistance of a Licenced Building Practitioner (LBP) to supervise or carry out the design and construction work, which will allow consenting authorities to focus more on higher risk building work. It is also a great reflection of the expertise that LBPs provide, and will help boost their profile to the public.
The current Exemption 18 in schedule 1 of the Building Act, amended in August 2020, applies to free-standing or attached carports that are:
On ground level.
No greater than 20m2.
This amendment also introduced Exemption 18A to allow greater floor area of carports to be constructed without a building consent.
Exemption 18A applies to free-standing or attached carports where:
They are built on ground level.
The floor area is between 20m2 and 40m2.
Any design or construction work is carried out or supervised by a licensed building practitioner or the design is carried out or reviewed by a chartered professional engineer.
Exemption 18A recognises the capacity and capability of professional people in design and construction of carports over 20m2 and less than 40m2. These professionals are well placed to manage the risks associated with compliance with the building code requirements.
It’s important to remember that the building consent process is only one part of the legal requirements for building a carport. All the usual requirements about durability of materials, district planning, location of services and boundary restrictions still apply.
Carport vs Garage There is no detailed or fully explicit definition for a carport in the current building regulations. However, Clause A1 of the Building Code classifies a carport as an outbuilding. This classification primarily applies to buildings not intended for human habitation that are an accessory to the principal use of associated buildings.
A carport is a covered parking structure for the storage of lightweight vehicles, and is commonly used in connection with a dwelling. A carport is covered, but not fully enclosed, which must be open on one or more sides. A fully enclosed space with doors would be reasonably considered a garage, and these are covered by different rules.
Structural considerations A carport may be freestanding or attached to another building. However, if you wish to attach a carport to a building, due consideration should always be given to the impact the fixtures or connections may have on the weather tightness and structural integrity of the existing building.
All carport structures are required to comply with the requirements of clause B1-structure of the Building Code. For example, a carport must resist the lateral force acting on its structure (wind and seismic), as well as potential loads on top of its own weight (such as snow loads). The structure of carports is outside the scope of the Acceptable Solution B1/AS1 , especially when cantilevered structural elements are designed to resist loads.
Kitset solutions If a homeowner is looking to use this exemption for a pre-manufactured carport, or a ready-to-assemble carport kit, they would need to make sure that the design has been verified by a Chartered Professional Engineer. If a supplier or manufacturer does not have such verifications, you will still be able to cater for this exemption as an LBP under exemption 3B, but a homeowner will not be able to exercise it without obtaining verifications from the right people.
A producer statement may be a good means of demonstrating that a kitset design complies with the clause B1 of the Building Code, for example, if the structure is designed by an engineer using B1/VM1 .
Be aware of fire risks Regardless of whether a building consent is required, a carport must comply with the Building Code and your council’s planning rules. The Building Code limits fire spreading and heat transmitting across boundaries.
A carport generally has a lesser risk of fire spread to neighbouring buildings than a garage due to the venting of heat and smoke from its open sides. It is common practice to use low-height walls or lattice type screens (trellis type components) to cover the side-walls of a carport in order to achieve a better fire performance. Also, these side-walls can result in less likely use of a carport for the storage of any substantial quantity of substances or materials that may increase the potential for fire.
Consider the extra roof area It is important to note that the storm water runoff from larger carports may be significant, and this will need to be taken into account, and be compliant with the Building Code, as stormwater must be collected in a way so that it does not create a risk to land, buildings and structures nearby. This would generally be achieved by installing gutters, downpipes and stormwater pipes. The roof-water must then be discharged appropriately. It is recommended that you check with your local council about where to discharge the stormwater.
Further information You can find the updated information in the guidance document Building work that does not require a building consent on the Building Performance website at building.govt.nz .
This article is an excerpt from Codewords Issue 98. Reading Codewords articles that are relevant to your licence class is a mandatory requirement for Licensed Building Practitioners. These questions can be answered through the LBP portal, online at underconstruction.placemakers.co.nz or recorded on the magazine, then provided at the time of renewal.

Under Schedule 1 of the Building Act 2004, there are some building projects that don’t require building consent. It was updated in 2020 to exempt low-risk building work, such as sleepouts, sheds, carports, outdoor fireplaces and ground-mounted solar panels from consents; however, there are still conditions that builders need to meet
Passed in November 2013, the Building Amendment Act 2013 details the range of work not requiring a building consent. Exemptions are detailed in a live document, which has been updated four times since it was released in 2014.
The document ‘Building work that does not require a consent’ is available for download by searching ‘Building work consent not required guidance’ on building.govt.nz/projects-and-consents/ .
It’s important to keep up to date with the changes and to understand which projects do or don’t require a consent. This article focuses on the common exempt building work added to the list of exemptions in 2020.
Single-story detached buildings
The following examples are exempt from consent:
Kitset or prefab buildings with a maximum floor area of 30m 2 where a manufacturer or supplier has had the design carried out or reviewed by a Chartered Professional Engineer.
Buildings with a maximum floor area of 30m 2 where a Licensed Building Practitioner (LBP) carries out or supervises design and construction or buildings with a maximum floor area of 30m 2 where only lightweight materials with structural components built in accordance with Acceptable Solution B1/AS1 are used – this work may be done without the help of a professional.
Carports
Carports up to 40m 2 in size can be built without a consent if the design has been carried out or reviewed by a Chartered Professional Engineer or an LBP has carried out or supervised design and construction.
Ground-floor awnings
Awnings up to 30m 2 on a ground floor can be built without a consent if the design has been carried out or reviewed by a Chartered Professional Engineer or an LBP has carried out or supervised design and construction.
Sleepouts
Sleepouts up to 30m 2 no longer require building consents if the work is carried out or supervised by an LBP. A sleepout must be its own height away from a boundary and must not be designed to be lived in exclusively.
Outdoor fireplace or ovens
A permanent outdoor fireplace or oven can be built up to a maximum height of 2.5m, with a maximum cooking surface of 1m 2 without a building consent. The fireplace or oven must be at least 1m away from any legal boundary or building; however, double check what local government restrictions there are regarding lighting open fires.
Flexible water storage bladders
Flexible water storage bladders with up to 200,000L storage capacity supported on the ground for use in irrigation or firefighting.
Ground-mounted solar panels
Ground-mounted solar panels up to 20m2, built in an urban zone, can be built without the help of a professional. Ground-mounted panels between 20-40m2, in an uber zone, can be built without a consent if the design has been carried out or reviewed by a Chartered Professional Engineer.
There is no restriction on size for solar panel arrays in rural zones.
Structures, bridges, pole sheds and barns
Small pipe supporting structures can be built without a consent if they only carry water and are on private land. Short-span bridges can be built without a consent if they are a maximum of 6m long and if they do not span a road or rail area. The design also needs to be carried out or reviewed by a Chartered Professional Engineer.
Pole sheds or hay barns in rural zones can be built as long as they are no larger than 110m2 and the design has been carried out or reviewed by a Chartered Professional Engineer or an LBP has carried out or supervised design and construction.
Verandas and porches
It is possible to build a veranda or porch of up to 30m2 on a ground floor without a building consent if the design has been carried out or reviewed by a Chartered Professional Engineer or an LBP has carried out or supervised the building work.
Plumbing and drainage
Certain plumbing and drainlaying jobs can be done without a consent if the job is done by an authorised person, such as a registered certifying plumber or drainlayer or a plumber or drainlayer carries out the work under the supervision of a registered certifying plumber or drainlayer – as long as they are registered, hold a provisional licence, or are under training.
The following can be carried out without a consent:
Repair, maintenance, and replacement of sanitary plumbing and drainage.
Drainage access points.
Repair and maintenance of existing water heater.
Replacement of open-vented water storage heater connected to supplementary heat exchanger.
Replacement or repositioning of water heater connected to controlled heat source.
Minor alteration to drains.
Alteration to existing sanitary plumbing (excluding water heaters).
Always check before you build
If you are not sure if your work requires a consent, you can check Schedule 1 of the Building Act 2004. It’s also important to note that some exempt building work requires an authorised professional to carry out. Authorised professionals include Chartered Professional Engineers, a person authorised under the Plumbers, Gasfitters and Drainlayers Act 2006 and Licensed Building Practitioners. •
However, it’s still important to note that work must comply with the Building Code and legislative requirements such as the Resource Management Act 1991 and the Electricity Act 1992.
While the projects outlined above relate to the 2020 updates, below • are additional, common examples of what can be carried out without a consent:
Retaining walls up to 1.5m high, providing they are not carrying any load other than the ground.
Fences up to 2m high, other than fences around swimming pools.
Garden sheds less than one storey and 10m2 in floor area, which do not contain sanitary facilities or facilities for the storage of drinking water and are not positioned any closer than the shed’s own height to a boundary.
Decks not more than 1.5m off the ground.

Our regular business coaching contributor shares his own experience in building a sustainable business – and offers three key factors to make it work
Starting a business can be really difficult! Fifteen years ago, when I started my coaching business, I had a great coaching system but only a few clients, which was difficult.
Fortunately, I quickly discovered that the handful of building clients I had at the time responded particularly well to my coaching programme. I decided this was a sign and stuck with them, developing a solid coaching business by focusing on builders – thus The Successful Builder was born. Since then, I’ve had the privilege of helping many builders become successful business owners.
In the process, I discovered three transferable keys to building a sustainable business, and I teach these to all my clients.
1.Be a specialist
Most builders I work with are above-average tradespeople. They are resourceful people, who can turn their hand to almost any building problem. Moreover, should they come across a new problem, they know where to go to  find help.
So, when they present to a potential client, they do so as an all-round building guy. However, almost every builder I have worked with also prefers a certain type of work.
Some love renovations and would do nothing else if they had the choice. Being the expert, solving unexpected challenges and having to rely on personal experience gives them a real buzz. They love working with homeowners  and helping them plan changes to their home.
Others prefer high-end architectural builds, where cost is not a huge focus and challenge. They find fulfilment in working with good designers and engineers, and being part of a team working on award-winning homes and  buildings.
Others prefer building typical new homes, with the focus on speed and efficiency – organising the subbies and getting the job done in the best possible timeframe with a solid outcome.
The thing is, when you specialise in doing what you are really good at, you start to get a reputation as an expert in that area. That attracts better customers and, because you are working in one area, you become even more  competent. Because I have specialised in builders for so long, I find there’s no situation I meet these days that I haven’t met before.
Ask yourself: What kind of building work do I prefer doing? What kind of work gets me most excited? What kind of work am I really good at? Then look for work in that area, and promote yourself as a specialist.
2. Fantastic clients
Too few builders actually stop to think about the kind of clients from whom they get the best results, the best references and the best referrals. Yet these people are probably their ideal clients.
They are the people you just seem to ’hit it off’ with. They love what you have done for them and tell everyone they know about you. What’s more, you really enjoyed working with them. If you had a choice, all your clients would  be like these people and what a fantastic business you’d then have.
But the reality is, you can choose.
When I ask some builders who their favourite clients are, they look at me blankly. Yet if I ask them what their favourite truck is, I get an instant answer! Now, what’s more important? Surely having favourite clients.
There is nothing worse than scoring a large job and then discovering part-way through that you are working with a very difficult client – one with impossible expectations. If only you had known that earlier, you wouldn’t have bothered following up the lead. But you didn’t check out if they fitted your ‘favourite client’ profile.
When I discovered that my ideal builder is qualified, has a great work ethic and integrity and loves delivering excellence, it made locating them much easier.
So, what’s your favourite client profile? How old is s/he? Where do they live? What are their preferences? What do they want?
Most importantly, what are you doing to attract more of these? If it’s not enough, look at how you can reach these potential customers.
3. Make profit
The bottom line of any business is profit. Too often I hear the complaint that there are lots of dollars going through the business account, but very little profit at the end of the day. It’s not alright to do all that work and not have  much to show for it.
The thing is, if the economics of a business are not right, then it doesn’t matter what else might be going well, the business is not going to be sustainable. Economics do matter. Profit is important.
So, when you are thinking about your next client and job, ask yourself the following questions: Am I sure I can complete this job efficiently? Have I priced it correctly to ensure it generates my desired profit? Are these the kind of people who can afford to pay on time? Does this building contract protect me against unforeseen issues? Can I make the same amount of profit with less risk?
When I realised that building businesses often have large turnovers, and small adjustments can make a huge difference to returns, finding my coaching fee quickly was not difficult – another reason I chose building businesses.
So, what jobs are making profit for you? Where have you lost money? What difference would it make to your business if you only worked on profitable jobs?
Takeaway
Each of the above concepts are important  by themselves. But imagine if you had a  business where all three were in play? Imagine your business where you are known as the specialist, working only with clients you love, and on only jobs that made profit! Do you think your life might be easier?

In business, there is no one right way to achieve growth. However, before expanding, it’s important you fully understand your company, because while growth can lead to bigger profits, it can also lead to collapse
Every business starts out small and requires a lot of work before you can start make a living from it. After a while, you may want to expand and this could include moving into another sector. Growth is often a key target, because the perception is big profits equals big business. Below are some methods that could help you take your business to the next level:
This happens naturally via an increased volume of work and higher turnover. It can happen quickly, or over time and is largely dependent on the effort you put into your business, and how targeted that effort is.
You need to take care to ensure that your resources grow at the same rate as the rest of the business, otherwise the quality of your work will suffer and your efforts will be wasted.
You can achieve growth quickly using this method, as you immediately benefit from the additional size and ability of the acquired business. This approach simply involves buying another business:
If you’re trying to grow in your sector, target a competitor, such as another building business.
If the goal is to expand into previously untapped markets, acquire a complementary business, such as a roofer or bricklayer.
However, this method carries risks. It’s important to ensure you perform proper due diligence and consultation before any acquisitions. There are numerous horror stories where the financial performance of the acquired business has been inflated, or the processes used by each business did not complement each other.
The purchase of a poorly suited business can often drag down a successful parent company. If you’re buying a business that is reputable and well positioned, you should be able to merge it into your operations as a stand-alone company without much interference. Conversely, an underachieving business will require greater capital input.
“You need to take care to ensure that your resources grow at the same rate as the rest of the business, otherwise the quality of your work will suffer and your efforts will be wasted
This is usually limited to individual projects and is an effective way to win contracts that you otherwise couldn’t. Big players in the construction market commonly use this method, so that they can tap into other business areas while spreading their risk.
It’s important to ensure that the parties you’re looking to work with have similar views and are willing to work cohesively to ensure the job is finished on time and on budget.
A good example of this would be if you were looking to tackle a subdivision project, but wanted the investment and advice of a strong partner with expertise in another area of the construction industry.
Diversification can either be vertical (moving up or down your supply chain), or horizontal (branching out into a different sector, such as plumbing).
It’s a good way to spread risk and/or protect the business from supplier demands or other contractors.
By utilising vertical diversification, you would be buying either a supplier of goods or a distributor of your own products. By doing so, you would gain greater control of the supply of goods and services to your company.
Horizontal diversification would be purchasing a complementary business to tie in with your own, so that you can offer more services to customers in your industry.
Coupled with these methods, you should also keep the following in mind:
When to get off the tools.
Timing growth according to market conditions.
As the business grows, it will require someone working full-time in a managerial role – it’s usually better to do this sooner rather than later.
When it comes to timing, it’s critical to get the growth phase aligned with an upturn in the market you operate in. There’s no point in investing capital in the business or acquiring new projects if work is slow and hard to find.
While the above is a snapshot of what’s important to grow a business, there’s a lot more to understand. With that in mind, Crowe Horwath has teamed up with Minter Ellison Rudd Watts to provide a free comprehensive afternoon training session to cover these areas in more detail and give you and your business the tools it needs in order to achieve success. The sessions begin in late April 2015 and will be running in different locations around the country.

Recently, I asked a group of builders what they felt a prospective client wants to see on a builder’s website. They suggested a full range of services, a gallery of past work, references from satisfied customers, awards and memberships, guarantees and more.
When I checked a number of builders’ websites, that’s pretty much what I found – pictures of great-looking houses, the logo and the name of the company, lists of services provided, awards, memberships and guarantees.
While these are great items to have on your website, some important aspects were routinely missing:
When looking through family albums, which one do you stop and look at? The one with YOU in it! It’s just how we are. So, think of the internet as a giant photo album, through which your clients are flipping – page after page after page.
Where will they stop? When they get to a page (site) in which they see themselves. Simple but true. Because while looking, they’re asking the question “Could this client be me?”
So, if you want them to stop at your website, just include ‘their’ picture on the front page! It’ll make them stop every time.
The general response I receive when I suggest this to builders is that they don’t know what ‘they’ look like.
That’s often because most websites are trying to attract everyone and anyone. But you can’t supply expert services to everyone – and most clients don’t like to see themselves as just anyone.
So focus your website on your ideal customer (which I discussed in my last article). Think about what they wear, drive, eat, etc. Then review your website graphics with this in mind and make sure your photos are in line with that.
By doing this, when your ideal customer arrives at your website, you can almost hear them exclaim, “That’s me!” or “That’s us!”
OK, so your ideal customer has arrived at your website and found themselves surrounded by familiar people and things, so they know they are at the right place. Their next question is: “Can you give me what I need?”
Now, the truth is that even though they think they know their needs, they often don’t – they know their wants. For example, your client wants a new executive home, but might not know what s/he needs. For example, they don’t know how big it should be, what kind of roof is best in their setting or which materials to use for the cladding, etc. They may not even be precise about the number of rooms.
You can help them by asking diagnostic questions, such as what kind of houses they prefer, how many people will be living there, does it need to be child-friendly and do you expect to retire here?
“You want your website to start asking the questions that gets your prospective client thinking – then they will call you for answers
This will show them that you want to build a home that’s right for them and demonstrate your ability to help them move from wants to needs. Anyone can simply display heaps of impressive information – the internet’s full of it – but an expert locates the real need, and your customer knows when their real need is being dealt with.
So, review your website content. Does it deliver information, or does it raise expert questions? Consider including questions such as: Do you need a home study capacity for your teenagers? Do you plan to work out of your home? What level of soundproofing do you need? Do you plan to accommodate extended family at any time (number of bathrooms)? What will your family look like five (or ten) years from now?
You want your website to start asking the questions that gets your prospective client thinking. Then they will call you for answers.
Having found the right people (‘people like me’) and the right builder (one who understands my specific needs) your prospective client needs to have confidence in you to provide the solution.
This is where testimonials come into their own, because they provide independent proof from people like them.
Remember, a testimonial is NOT a reference – there is a chalk and cheese difference between the two.
A reference is all about the character of the builder, whereas a testimonial focuses on the client’s needs being met and says very little about the builder. Instead, it tells the story of the client in three parts:
1) their needs and aspirations;
2) what they did to get those needs met; and
3) the results they received.
A testimonial only mentions the builder in passing, focusing instead on the actions the satisfied client took – actions your ideal customers could imitate.
So review your testimonials and make sure they’re not just full of nice things about you. While it’s great for them to hear that you were accommodating and easy to deal with, everyone is different and it’s the actions you take that matter most. Make sure your testimonials include your customers’ needs, what they did about them and how they now feel about the results.
Take the time to review your website, as it’s often your first point of contact with prospective clients. While a number of websites fail to do the trick, many work – especially the ones that meet a prospective customer face-to-face, like a mirror on the wall.

IRD steps up monitoring of tradies around the country to find those not declaring income
Construction is a hotbed of activity in what is dubbed the ‘Hidden Economy’. There has been a high level of non-compliance by smaller operators in the sector not declaring part (or in some cases) all the cash payments they receive. That’s why IRD is interested in tradies’ affairs.
Behind the scenes, IRD is running detailed analytics over large volumes of third-party data to find taxpayers who may be underreporting their income, so compliance officers can make targeted interventions. While IRD maintains its first assumption is to believe the taxpayer may need help getting their taxes right, or may be unaware of their obligations, it will act if it becomes evident someone isn’t complying.
But how can they tell? Cash doesn’t leave a trail, right?
Wrong. It does, as it is likely to be spent at some point. IRD is comparing taxpayers’ spending habits (think living expenses, mortgage re-payments and other purchases) with their income tax returns to identify any outliers. If tradies can’t explain where the money to pay for those things came from, IRD’s suspicions may be aroused.
There are serious repercussions if you are caught.
Any additional tax obligations that arise from undeclared income carries IRD interest (currently 8.22%) and shortfall penalties. These penalties range from anywhere between 20 to 150% of the tax shortfall, depending on the seriousness of the breach. Criminal prosecution may also follow.
Below are a few pointers to help you out if IRD decides there are grounds to investigate your affairs further.
Know your rights
IRD investigators are entitled to visit your business without warning. Should one show up, ask to see their identification and take their business card.
Refrain from answering any questions. Take their contact details and arrange a time to meet with them along with your accountant.
Don’t let them take original documents, as these can get lost or misplaced. Insist they make copies if they require any information.
Don’t go it alone
IRD audits are a specialist area and legally complex, so it’s wise to engage the services of someone who has expertise in both. Sure, they’ll charge fees, but it’ll be worth every cent given the considerable time, stress and money you’ll save.
Respond to IRD swiftly
Deliver any information IRD wants by the deadlines imposed. If you require more time, let IRD know as soon as possible and negotiate a new date to supply what is required. Doing this shows you take your tax compliance seriously.
Fess up
Make a voluntary disclosure if you haven’t been entirely honest. Doing so has some advantages.
Firstly, it can reduce any shortfall penalty. This can be by 40%, 75% or even 100% in some cases, depending on what stage of the investigation you make the disclosure.
Secondly, you can reduce the chances of criminal prosecution.
Use tax pooling
If you receive a notice of reassessment from the taxman, an IRD-approved tax pooling provider can reduce the interest cost by up to 30% on any additional tax payable. Savings are considerable.
You also receive an extra 60 days from the date the notice of reassessment was issued to pay.

New Zealand farmers are resilient people – builders can learn a lot from how they ride the peaks and troughs of seasonal work, writes business expert Graeme Owen
F armers in New Zealand are subject to many influences over which they have no control, such as the weather, exchange rates, interest rates, international trade relations, diseases and oil prices. Yet those same farmers repeatedly rise above such uncertainties and bounce back from the bigger shocks that affect them from time to time.
Can we learn from them ?
If you are running a building business then, yes, you can learn heaps from our farmers about the mindset required to survive and thrive in the face of challenges, problems, and sudden shocks.
1. Things come in cycles
Farmers observe the cycle of life and learn the natural rhythms of the seasons. There is a time to plant and a time to harvest. There’s the cold of winter, when things seem dead, and the withering heat of summer. All of these moments pass. An experienced farmer does the kind of work that is required in each season.
Similarly, in the building business, there are observable cycles. Smart business owners accept that, while they can’t influence the cycle, they can adapt their activity to suit it. Cycles come and go, but they each tend to have their own traits. Understanding these and acting accordingly is doing business like a farmer.
2. You’re a survivor
The majority of farmers I have met are survivors. They may need some immediate help (material and psychological) to recover from a large shock, and they may whinge a bit, but most farmers know they will survive.
While the shock of an unexpected event may feel like the end of the world, it usually isn’t. In fact, it is often shocks, threats and disasters that spurn creativity and innovation. So, when you face your next big problem, don’t only focus on survival – be on the lookout for opportunities. Believe you will survive!
3. Contagious confidence
The farming families that I know personally have an innate sense of self-confidence – and it’s contagious. The experiences and knowledge of the older members are passed down to the next, giving them the ability to make decisions with insight beyond their years. That leads to confidence in implementing new ideas that may take years to mature.
Remember when you were learning to ride a bike ? Other kids could ride confidently, so you knew you could too. Like me, you probably fell off the first few times, but you just got up and tried again until you succeeded. You kept at it until your skill increased and you could ride without falling off. Then you rode with confidence. If you’re in business then you have already demonstrated confidence in yourself. You may have experienced setbacks – every successful business owner has – but you have picked yourself up and moved on.
Confidence does not protect you against shocks, but it does give you the power to keep going and the presence to take others with you.
So, if circumstances require that you need to make changes in the way you run your business, get the best advice you can and then make the changes. Decisive actions lead to decisive results (good or bad). Evaluating those results enables you to make better plans going forward, and to take your team with you.
Better plans deliver better results. Better results improve confidence. Confidence is contagious.
4. Get prepared
Experienced farmers have a good idea of the likely threats to their farms. They know the impact of certain weather on particular areas, and what they need to do when disaster threatens. They heed forecasts and move stock and materials to suit, knowing that years of work can be lost in days.
Some of the recent flooding in the North Island has been accentuated by older infrastructure designed for lower rates of precipitation. If we had known ten years ago what 2023 would deliver, we could have been better prepared.
So, how might you prepare ? Take time to think about how you will cope with sudden price increases ? Unavailability of products ? Cancelled jobs ? Staff losses ? Consider what are the key vulnerabilities in your business and start preparing a plan to cope with these. Maybe you need to build a cash surplus to get you through, or diversify a little to spread the risk ?
Takeaway
If there is one thing the past few years have taught us, it is that “change is the only constant” and we will see periods when everything is running smoothly, followed by periods when everything seems to be in upheaval. Thinking like a farmer can help you traverse these times.

Here’s an example of how one builder (we’ll call him Bob) built a million-dollar business in just over a year
Not only has Bob significantly grown his business, he receives emails like this from his customers:
“You have provided such outstanding, detailed, up front and specific service exactly tailored to our needs and budget. We really appreciate it and pretty much find it impossible not to choose your company as a result.”
Below are the four simple steps Bob made an integral part of his business model. Give them a try and see if it helps your business.
From day one, and while still learning how to sell, Bob made a point of following up every single enquiry and making personal contact with the homeowner. He didn’t win every job but kept going and never lost confidence in the sales principle ‘people buy from people’.
It was time intensive; many small jobs that didn’t make a lot of money could have been handled over the phone, but by visiting every potential customer and asking the same set of questions every time, he gained a first-hand understanding of what was important to the homeowners in his area.
Bob also found out what frustrated them when they dealt with his competitors in the area.
While it’s true that people may be the same the world over, every local community has its own particular set of quirks and idiosyncrasies. Knowing these gives you a healthy advantage when you’re selling your services in and around the community.
Try asking yourself the following questions:
What are the peculiarities of the potential clients in my area?
What frustrates them about builders?
How do I tailor my approach to them?
Because Bob was learning more and more about what was important to the homeowners in his city, he was able to target his simple advertising flyers and brochures to address these matters, then the phone started ringing more often.
That’s when he also got to know the kinds of problems that local homeowners were facing at that time of the year. Using this knowledge, he focused his advertising on their specific needs. He wondered if others in the immediate area were likely to be facing similar situations, because they share the same micro-climate and their homes were of similar age and construction.
He found that in winter, he was dealing with roofs and drainage; in spring, he was working more on small renovations and decks; then in autumn, Bob’s attention was more focused on kitchens and bathrooms.
When he looked at the marketing material of other builders in his area, he discovered most were running with the same advertising month after month, irrespective of the season. They listed everything they could do, even though they hardly ever did most of them.
Homeowners generally only need one thing repaired at a time and a long list of services is confusing. When he focused his advertising on their specific, seasonal needs, it seemed to stand out more than the rest. The proof? The phone rang.
Homeowners tend to select builders they think will give them the least inconvenience. Repairs and maintenance can be frustrating, and everyone has heard the bad news stories. All people want to be treated well and with respect, so Bob devised this straightforward four-point guarantee:
To start within 14 days.
To only invoice for actual work done.
To repair any poor workmanship at no cost.
To professionally clean up.
They may seem like small things, but they are important to the homeowners in his area.
What is important to the homeowners in your catchment?
“Many builders fail to take advantage of what is probably the best and cheapest marketing in the world – asking for referrals
Many builders fail to take advantage of what is probably the best and cheapest marketing tool in the world – asking for referrals. It may seem self-seeking, self-promoting, self-centred and desperate, but it doesn’t need to be.
Bob simply learnt to ask his clients if they had any friends or family that could do with some advice about maintaining or repairing their homes. Because he had proved reliable and trustworthy (like the majority of builders), his clients were willing to put him in touch with their friends and family.
When he visited them, he treated them in exactly the same way as he treated the referrer and received similar results. As Bob’s company grew, he trained his staff to do likewise and, as the list of satisfied customers grew, leads started to come in for larger jobs.
Sometimes the simplest approach is the best. Bob was able to quickly grow his business by taking this approach and recently enjoyed an overseas holiday with his family. Try it out and maybe you could, too!

Taking his building business from a team of three to 22 over two years has been a dream come true for The Successful Builder (TSB) client Jeremy Claridge , but that doesn’t mean it was an easy journey. TSB asked him if he would share what he has learned that might help other young builders starting out in the business
TSB: Starting out in business can be hard and slow. How did you go about getting clients in the first place?
JEREMY: I focused on delivering great service and then getting referrals from satisfied clients. It meant we kept getting clients who also wanted great service.
TSB: More recently you have grown dramatically. What has been the single most important step you have taken that’s delivered this success?
JEREMY: I had to learn to value and manage my time. When I became serious about growing my business, one of the key things I realised was that I needed to get control of time.
It became clear that this was my only truly irreplaceable asset, so I needed to use it better. I had an apprentice and intermittent contractors, so I was personally busy on the tools, and gaining control over time took discipline.
I started by keeping a planning diary and scheduling when I would work on the tools – including how many hours each week – and when I would work on quoting and invoicing.
I learned to collate similar tasks into blocks of time and do these all at once. I became more focused and more efficient. It was a bit frustrating, as sometimes I had to compromise on completing immediate tasks to achieve long-term goals.
Everyone has the same number of hours in the day, so if you want to improve your results, then you need to learn to use your time differently.
TSB: When you started out, you told me that you didn’t really know much about business. How is it that you now have a company of 22 people?
JEREMY: Everyone’s an expert when you start out in business. Everyone has an opinion about what you should and shouldn’t do. But there are some opinions that you simply shouldn’t listen to. Initially I wasn’t sure how to pick the better opinions, and it cost me, but now I know.
TSB: So what constitutes good advice?
JEREMY: Firstly, just because someone is good at business doesn’t necessarily make them good at advising others.
Secondly, some professionals are really good at working with small businesses in general areas, but they run out of steam when you want them to give you specific help for your business ASAP!
Thirdly, I learned that there is a difference between business knowledge and business wisdom. Business knowledge is about what is generally true, but it doesn’t take into account the specific cultural, personnel and local specifics of an individual business (or my personality!)
This is where business wisdom is important. Something that may be true in most situations, may be unwise in my specific situation.
You need to find advisors who know both the business you are in, and who will take the time to get to know your particular situation. No advisor will ever get it right all the time, so be prepared to balance advice with your own developing experience.
TSB: Some time ago, I did a tally up and discovered that a custom build normally involves up to 40 different subcontractors and suppliers. How do you build relationships with this many people and/or companies?
JEREMY: One of the first things I was told by a mentor was to surround myself with good subbies and suppliers, so from the beginning I have made a conscious decision to only work with people who share my values.
It’s taken longer to grow this type of network, but it’s proved worthwhile when something’s gone wrong, as there’s a common foundation on which to work out a solution. It just makes good business sense to eliminate conflicts that arise from having different values.
Furthermore, we learned to talk to our suppliers as soon as we thought we might be facing a problem and to map out how we planned to resolve it. The great people at Placemakers Evans Bay have been particularly helpful – Graeme Joy and his team have believed in us, supported us, and provided consistent and competitive pricing and really good service as we’ve grown. Relationships like that are gold.
Being a builder isn’t easy, so surrounding yourself with good people really helps make it better.
TSB: You have grown to a team of 22. What have you learned about recruiting?
JEREMY: In some respects, it’s fairly straightforward; as the old saying goes, ‘if you pay peanuts, you will get monkeys’. In our situation, we try to offer something really unique to our staff in the form of culture, income and work-life balance.
I was fortunate that the first person I took on as an apprentice was a really great guy, who stayed with me after completing his time and only left because he moved to another city.
Now when we recruit, we focus first on the ability of the applicant to fit into our team culture. Of course skill is important, but we would rather not hire someone than compromise on the character and attitude we look for.
We also teach our team to appreciate that we get paid by the client – not by the company – and delivering quality in good time is the key to ensuring this.
TSB: A final word of advice?
JEREMY: Don’t be afraid of risk.
Running a building business, or any business for that matter, comes with some element of risk. If you get it wrong, it can and will cost you. However, there are steps you can take to minimise risk. Things do go wrong, but when you have good systems the risks are reduced.
We have put in place processes that give us up-to-the-moment information about the progress of each job against its schedule. This enables us to intervene immediately if we suspect there might be a problem. Our accountant helps us plan our cash flow to ensure that we will always be able to meet our commitments, and our marketing and sales processes give us a measure of control over the number of clients we take on.
If I was to make a final comment, it would be that self-belief is also crucial – set your sights high, but make sure to create goals and steps to lead you there.

Construction Growth Foundation (CGF) is partnering with Business Mentors New Zealand (BMNZ) to deliver mentoring to help strengthen business capability in the construction sector. To achieve this, it is funding mentorship opportunities for small and medium-sized businesses
The initiative addresses a key issue for the sector, where smaller firms predominate and many struggle to maintain financial sustainability long term, as reflected by the fact that half close fewer than five years after beginning trading.
Under the partnership agreement, CGF will fund mentoring registrations for 12 months from 1 May 2025, which will enable BMNZ’s mentoring support to be offered to small (up to 20 FTEs) businesses that are members of a CGF member association. Click here to see if you belong to a CGF member association.
Successful applicants will receive a year’s mentoring, gaining access to tailored, one-on-one support from BMNZ’s national pool of over 1,500 experienced volunteer mentors.
A chance to build a business foundation
CGF’s Chief Executive, Brian Dillon, said many small and medium-sized (SME) construction business owners are highly skilled in their trade or profession but may not have had the opportunity to build up business knowledge.
“By offering this mentoring support, we’re responding to the need to develop business skills, which will ultimately benefit the sector as a whole. We’re delighted to partner with BMNZ given their track record of empowering kiwi businesses across a range of sectors for the past 34 years,” said Dillon.
BMNZ connects entrepreneurs and SME owners with experienced volunteer mentors who offer practical guidance on everything from managing staff to growing revenue and overcoming industry-specific challenges.
Interested business owners can register for mentoring support by clicking here and specifying which organisation they are affiliated with and why a mentor would benefit them.
Vital support
BMNZ’s Chief Executive, Sarah Trotman, said the organisation has supported over 80,000 businesses to date, including some in the construction sector, and knows that support for trade businesses is urgently needed.
“We know business owners in the construction trades and professions are facing significant pressures – from skills shortages to rapid growth demands. A mentor who has ‘been there and done that’ can make a huge difference. CGF’s support through this partnership enables us to reach more of these business owners and equip them with the guidance they need to succeed long term,” said Trotman.
The Building and Construction Training Fund (BCTF) was established in October 2021 after changes came into effect following the previous government’s Review of Vocational Education (RoVE). This resulted in the disestablishment of the Building and Construction Industry Training Organisation (BCITO), from which BCTF emerged. In April 2025 it adopted a new constitution, from which the name changed to Construction Growth Foundation (CGF). A core focus of CGF’s strategy is capability-building and skills development to support the long-term resilience and sustainability of its member associations and the sector as a whole.

The last in our series on integrating migrant workers into your workforce focuses on accommodation – along with a round-up of everything we’ve covered over the past few months
The process of finding accommodation in New Zealand may be different to those in migrant workers’ countries. In New Zealand, rental properties are usually unfurnished – this means that, although an oven is provided, your worker may need to provide their own furniture (including beds and linen), refrigerator, washing machine, cutlery and cooking equipment. They will likely need guidance on the best place to buy these.
If your workers are bringing their family to New Zealand, you should suggest they come in advance to make arrangements. Where possible, you could provide or arrange accommodation for your workers.
Make your workers aware of websites that advertise accommodation, such as:
www.trademe.co.nz
www.allrealestate.co.nz
www.flatfinder.co.nz
It’s helpful if you have advice, but you don’t have to be the expert! Here are some useful websites that contain further information:
www.dbh.govt.nz/tenancy-index
www.dol.govt.nz/ssnzhousing
You should advise your migrant workers that their advance move-in costs could include a bond (equivalent of up to four weeks’ rent) and, in some cases, letting agent fees (usually one week’s rent plus GST).
Immigration New Zealand provides a free information service for new migrants. New migrants can use these services for information about living in New Zealand, for example, where to find a doctor, how to choose a school, understanding the health system, and clubs and community groups that they and their families can join.
There are four ways that new migrants can access free information about life in New Zealand.
Visit www.newzealandnow.govt.nz
Phone 0800 776 948 to ask questions ( ‘Language Line’ is available if they want to speak to someone in their own language)
Email their question to newmigrantinfo@mbie.govt.nz
Visit a Citizens Advice Bureau in one of 30 areas. See www.newzealandnow.govt.nz for details about the locations.
The faster migrants settle, the faster they’ll become productive members of your staff. A well-settled migrant is a productive employee, and more likely to remain loyal.
You can help by providing the migrant (and their family) with information and insight into the basics, such as introductions to schools and local settlement services.
To make sure you and your migrant workers get the most of their move to New Zealand, use this simple checklist as a guide to help smooth their integration into your workplace.
Before your migrant worker arrives in New Zealand, ask yourselves these questions:
Have I arranged for someone to meet them when they arrive?
Have I arranged for someone to act as a ‘buddy’ or mentor?
Do I have a written job description and/or a list of tasks and targets to give to the new employee?
Do I have written information about how we operate – staff structure and roles, lines of communication, hours of work, timings of breaks, use of internet/e-mail and telephone, etc.
Are their accommodation and transportation needs being met?
Are existing employees prepared for the new employee’s arrival?
Do I know something about the values and work styles of the new migrant employee’s culture?
Do I know how they expect to be managed?
Do I know about their cultural and religious beliefs and whether they have any religious commitments, such as going to church on a Saturday or Sunday?
Have I found out if there is a local person from the migrant’s ethnic community that I can put them in touch with?
Have I allowed for some time off in the first week for the new employee to organise their home life in New Zealand?
Have I organised a tour of the local area?
Check they have a driver’s licence and information about driving in New Zealand. If you’ve provided them with accommodation, show them around, explain the house rules and how to use its heating and equipment.
You should also:
Ensure they have the right clothing for work.
Prepare a written list of tasks.
Have their written employment agreement on hand.
Let them know there’s a free information service available for them, and give them the details.
Welcome your new employee.
Meet with the migrant and their immediate supervisor.
Introduce them to a ‘buddy’ or mentor.
Introduce them to team members.
Take them on a tour of the workplace and their own workstation/office.
Give them prepared written documents about the job and the workplace.
Show them how to safely use any important equipment.
Explain any workplace etiquette – e.g. use of kitchen, recycling.
Set up regular meetings with your migrant employee and their ‘buddy’ to help with settlement into the workplace.
Organise on-the-job or off-site training, including inducting them in your health and safety systems, and enroll them in safety training. Continue with your orientation programme and organise social work activities for your migrant employee, and their family, to help them integrate.
Ensure they are able to keep in touch with family back home – this can help to reduce feelings of isolation and homesickness. You should also be conscious of how you communicate:
Use simple language.
Explain jargon and new words.
Check you are understood when giving instructions – try asking the new migrant “so, what are you going to do first?” to see if they have understood.
Write things down – use a notice board or whiteboard, or signs and maps in the workplace.

Liquidation, receivership and bankruptcy are all risks when you run your own business, but a comprehensive accounting system can help you prevent it happening to yours
I t’s all too common in the construction industry to see a once-profitable businesses go bust, in some cases overnight. The obvious question to then ask is, where did it all go wrong ?
It’s not an easy question to answer, although one thing is certain – if the company had a comprehensive accounting system in place, they would likely still be trading.
Given the vast range of accounting systems currently available to business owners – from Xero to MYOB, through to cloud-based and customised solutions – choosing one to use can be challenging. There is something for everyone’s budget, and there is really no longer any excuse for not having an effective accounting system in place.
Get smart!
Smart accounting systems can revolutionise a business. They can reconcile bank transactions, prepare quotes, provide GST returns with a keystroke, prepare and email invoices to customers – all without you having to leave the construction site.
Businesses that have established budgets in place can benefit by incorporating accounting systems into this process, allowing them to track performance and identify areas of concern. For those businesses that don’t have a budget in place, an accounting system can help them set one up.
Modern accounting systems can also provide up-to-the minute reports on profit figures, GST, cash balances, and a whole lot more. Some can even provide an immediate reconciliation of the amount that has been charged for a job and what remains in the budget.
This type of information is invaluable, as it can assist with business planning and payments.
Having access to real-time information offers a greater insight into how a range of business decisions and late payers can impact on an organisation. It also provides an enhanced ability for both the business owner and their accountant to simultaneously view data anywhere, anytime.
Time management
A common complaint amongst builders is the amount of time it takes to reconcile bank accounts, prepare invoices and chase up debts. Time spent on this leaves less time available for hands-on business management and can even reduce leisure time.
An effective accounting system can put an end to long nights scanning accounts and paperwork. It opens up a world of insights and opportunities, and the freedom to choose how you spend your precious time.
In the next edition of Under Construction, we’ll take a closer look at and compare some of the more popular systems currently available.
If you would like to find out more about how accounting systems can enhance the way you do business, contact Peter van der Heijden at peter.vdh@crowehorwath.co.nz or your local Crowe Horwath advisor.

TITLE   : Quality quotes that win work

Do you get frustrated when your building company presentations don’t look as good as your competitors’, especially when you know they are not necessarily better builders? Here are some tips to give your quotes a more professional look
Unlike in many other service sectors, most residential building clients can’t ‘try before they buy’. They can’t simply get a replacement if they are unhappy with the product or service, so they need to choose a builder carefully.
Your clients are likely to base a large part of their decision on their experience during the quoting process. The real question then changes from ‘who is the better builder?’ to ‘who looks like the better builder?’
Here are seven simple things you can do to improve the presentation of your quotes:
Do it in person
Emailing your quote is the best way to tell your client they are not really important. It may seem like the faster way, but it is far less personal and, unless it is a small job, less likely to gain a favourable response. It is much better to go through your quote with them; this way, you can answer their questions face to face and on the spot.
Present professionally
Present well. Make sure you dress as a building professional, but don’t go overboard. Dress as your clients would expect someone to dress, who is advising them on investing hundreds of thousands of dollars. Remember, at this stage you are not the guy on the tools.
Use presentation aids. Get a nice satchel to carry all your documentation and use a nice pen. Make sure your quote is clear and easy to read and make use of the white space around text.
Don’t over-crowd the page and beware of simple mistakes, spelling etc. If using photos, ensure they are of a good quality and resolution. Your eye for detail is important here.
Include company promises
Your best promotional materials should provide answers to the ‘pre-sale’ qualifying questions that clients may or may not ask, but need to have answered in order to be happy to move ahead. Key amongst these are who you are, whether you can be trusted and why they should chose you.
Make sure that your documentation includes some information about you, the specific guarantees you provide and four to five good reasons for choosing you.
For example, it might be that, because you have lived in the area all your life, you understand the weather patterns and can advise on appropriate materials and guarantee better results.
If you have built in a number of other places, then you bring a national or international perspective that ensures best practice. If you don’t tell your client why they should choose you, nobody else will!
The purpose here is to overcome any emotional resistance to purchasing, so your client can focus on making a logical decision.
Introduce your people
Renovation clients in particular will want to know who is going to be working on their project, since they may well be living and working together for several months. They will want to know that their property will be respected and their needs recognised.
Introduce your prospective client to your team leader and allow them to connect on a personal level. Explain communication and security arrangements, and highlight what the team leader brings to the job. If you can’t introduce your team leader personally, then include a personal bio and photo with your proposal.
Showcase with photos
It can be difficult for new customers to imagine what their finished project will look like from plans and elevations, so an astute builder will include renders, photos of details and product brochures to make it easy for their new clients to see what they’ll get for their money.
Explain the process
Because your prospective client may complete only one major renovation or build in their entire lifetime, they are likely to have very little idea of what to expect.
It may be just another job to you, but for them it is a major part of their life. Take the time to explain the build process to them and what they should expect during construction, as this will help reduce misunderstandings and disappointments. A simple one-page flowchart can help to settle nerves and reassure them that you have the whole process in hand.
Clarify provisional sums
People new to construction contracts don’t fully understand why some works cannot be accurately priced and are included as provisional sums (PS).
Prime cost (PC) sums are clearer, since their choices affect the outcome (eg, an allowance of $30,000 for the kitchen), but PS sums can be a minefield. A careful builder will ensure that multiple quotes are properly compared in these areas to prevent client disappointment.
Because your client will judge the professionalism of your building business by the standard of your presentation, improving your presentation skills increases your chances of getting jobs.
Take a look at your building estimates and proposals and ask yourself, what can I do right now to raise the professional image of my building estimates?

The concept of ‘love’ doesn’t have an immediately obvious connection to the nuts and bolts of building, but, in this article, business coach Graeme Owen sheds light on how the two can be intimately connected
What difference would it make to your building business if your clients were to say: “we totally love our renovation/new build!”? What might they tell their friends? What would their testimonials say?
“Love is the way forward for business,” says Kevin Roberts, ex-CEO of Saatchi and Saatchi in his book Lovemarks: the future beyond brands (powerHouse Books, 2004). When customers have a positive emotional response to something, the effect is long-lasting.
When your clients love their build, and their experience of working with you, they are more likely to tell others and more likely to contact you again in the future – both of which should have a hugely positive impact on the success of your business. So, how do you help ensure your customers love your work?
1.Respect
Although your business may be small, your sales are often the largest purchase your client will make – larger than most of the products they will purchase from much bigger companies, maybe in their lifetime.
Further, a single contract can represent a large chunk of your business for any given year. So, respecting your clients for the value they bring you is an important foundation for love.
If you are selling things people need but don’t desire – eg, commodities such as gravel, petrol, basic food items –  you don’t need much respect, because there is little emotional attachment. But, as a home builder or renovator, you are selling something of much more importance and emotional investment.
This means you will want to increase the emotional connection between your client and your company by showing respect.
2.Commitment
Your clients will make long-term judgements about your company based on whether you deliver on your promises.
When you say “I’ll try and get this to you by Thursday”, they hear “I’ll get this to you by Thursday”. They don’t hear the word try. When you don’t get it done by your try-time, for whatever reason, they will feel let down (unloved).
So, because you want to love your clients, make sure that you only make commitments that you can keep.
3.Listen
You are a professional building advisor and you solve problems others run away from! You know what needs to be done after one quick look – but your client doesn’t.
At the top of their mind is the problems they are having now (either with their current house, or in planning a build). They need to know you are with them.
So, take time to listen to them when they tell you what they want. Ask questions. Before offering any solutions, make sure that you really understand their dilemma. Check that you are on the same page by asking “Are you saying…?” until they reply “Yes”. Then you know that you have really heard them.
4.Options
Sometimes what your client thinks they want is not always what they really need. If you give them exactly what they ask for, they may not get the best solution. They may not be aware of the possibilities that your professional help can provide.
So, don’t simply jump to quote the first solution. If you have other ideas, show them, even if they cost more – it may provide more options.
I remember planning the extension to our first house. I’d worked on every possibility and figured out the best place to extend. Our builder could have built it, but instead suggested we get a designer involved. Well, that changed everything! It cost more, but the outcome was many times better than my best. We loved our new home and were so grateful our builder had pushed us to consider other options.
So, don’t be afraid to help your clients consider other possibilities.
5.The long term
Build costs are high in New Zealand, and we tend to build to the minimum permissible standard, but the truth is the Building Code delivers the lowest possible quality house that you are legally permitted to build.
Are the cheapest, lowest level of material, fittings and finishings best for your client? It is highly likely they will not be aware of the advantages of certain materials over others. Ask yourself some questions. Would I install these in my own home? Should I warn my client about the maintenance costs of different claddings? Should I tell them about the life expectancy of different hardware?
It may be that building to a higher standard will cost more initially, but deliver a better long-term return for your client. If so, they are likely to love your company.
6.References
Here are three things you might be tempted to do, but please don’t:
Boast about how good you are.
Say you are better than other builders.
Disparage your competitors.
When you do that, you are just another desperate salesperson. Rather, show your prospective clients your testimonials and let your previous clients tell their story about your company.
Better still, introduce your prospective clients to your past clients. If they have been loved, they will shout your praises. A builder I knew would introduce a prospective client to a past client and leave them talking – in one case for an hour! But in (almost) every case, the experience of the past client ‘sold’ the prospective client.
7.Truth
No story spreads quicker than a bad review, especially if there has been any hint of deception. So be meticulously truthful.
Take care about what you say and promise. Take notes of meetings – especially where money is involved – and send your client a copy for confirmation. If you stuff up, own up! You will gain more respect for fronting up and fixing things than trying to cover and hide.
Takeaway It may not be usual to connect love and building, but builders who integrate love into their construction business are likely to have highly satisfied customers.

You don’t pour foundations without first knowing what is below the ground, so you probably shouldn’t employ a new team member without first checking their suitability
Finding tradespeople in the midst of a nationally recognised skills shortage is a challenge. When an applicant comes across your radar, you made be tempted to quickly hire them in an attempt to fill a void. However, it is important to take a patient approach to ensure the people you are hiring will suit your workforce and display the type of character that fits your company culture.
This article provides four key safeguards against hasty recruiting.
When interviewing builders, it is usually best to meet them in person, as it helps you get a well-rounded impression. Think of it like buying a used truck online ­— usually we want to view it first to ensure it’s all it’s cracked up to be.
Of course, if you’re hiring from abroad, you may not have the option of meeting in person. The next best option is a video call, as we learn much more by seeing than by hearing.
When you can see somebody it allows you to assess not only what they might say, but all the things they don’t say. Psychology Today says that 55% of communication is via body language, 38% is by the tone of voice, and only 7% is through the actual words spoken. So if you can only hear your candidate, you may only get half the story!
It is also worth taking notice of how your candidate dresses for the interview. It can tell you a lot about their personal pride and respect for others.
You’re struggling to find staff, when suddenly you get a hit with a CV in response to your advert. It’s well presented and they are a qualified builder with good experience — great! However, don’t be blinded by the light. Get your own evidence by testing their skills.
Ask all candidates to complete a small building task/test. This way, you can assess the quality of workmanship and select more carefully. I know some builders who have even travelled overseas to test candidates in this way.
Note: This isn’t always feasible for everyone, but in the event it isn’t, safeguards 1, 3 and 4 should provide enough of an insight.
Asking the right questions is another effective way to recruit the right builder. Past behaviour is a good predictor of future performance. How many times have you heard of someone hiring a builder who looked good on paper, only to find out they were a bad fit for the team and company?  They would turn up late to jobs, wouldn’t pull their weight, or just didn’t get on with the rest of the team.
Asking competency/behaviour-based questions, which look at actions taken in past situations, can help you to assess whether the candidate has the right skills and attitudes for the job.
Here are some examples:
Tell me about a time when you displayed leadership?
Give an example of a time when you had to go beyond what was required of you to ensure the customer was satisfied?
Tell me about a situation when you showed exceptional teamwork?
Give an example of a time when you had a negative run-in with a teammate. How did you handle it?
Describe a time when you had to learn a new skill quickly.
Give an example of a time when you used your initiative to overcome an obstacle.
The best way to find behavioural questions is to look at your job description and identify the key competencies, skills and attitudes necessary for the role. From here, create two to three questions for each, like the ones above, that will ask the candidate to give examples of when they have displayed the skills you are looking for.
Listening :
The key part is to listen for the actions they took. Don’t get caught up in the details of the actual situation or the result.  It’s the behaviours they displayed that will tell you the most. You may need to ask probing questions to your candidate to give the information you want.
A simple tool is the ‘CAR’ technique:
C – Context. What was the situation you found yourself in?
A – Action. What actions did you take?
R – Result. What was the result/outcome?
You may even want to qualify some situations with an additional ‘ L – Learnings’: What did you learn from this situation?
You wouldn’t buy a car without first looking under the hood and checking the service history. Similarly, you wouldn’t hire a builder without first checking with their past employers. References are an integral part of the recruitment process. As a rule of thumb, a minimum of two references should be contacted. Ask for their current employer and most recent employers.
When doing the reference check, listen to the tone of voice as well as what is not said.
Here are some examples of reference questions:
How would you rate Bob’s attention to detail?
How likely would you be to hire Bob again?
As a team member, how did he relate to others?
How would you describe his trustworthiness?
Was he always punctual?
What would you say are his top three strengths?
What would you say are areas for improvement?
Is there anything else you think we should be aware of?
Finding the right builder for your team does take some effort. However, the benefits of going through a structured interview process far outweigh the risk (and cost) of hiring the wrong person.

In last month’s issue, we looked at the reasons for having a robust accounting system in place. This month, we look at three different options, weighing up the pros and cons of each
A t the end of a long working day, the last thing many of us want to do is sit in an office and be overwhelmed by the sheer amount of bookwork that needs to be done.
All three products we’re reviewing are aimed at small to medium-sized companies and may not necessarily be suitable for larger organisations.
Each of the products has varying levels of functions, so we’ve taken a broad-based approach when reviewing them and what they can offer.
Xero
Its simplicity means that Xero is easily the most user-friendly option available to small businesses.
Pros
Fully online, it is accessible regardless of where you are.
Mobile app available.
Thousands of add-ons, including building-specific tools that allow for the flow through of invoicing.
Long established in online solutions.
Departmental/job reporting available via segment reporting.
Cons
Can be quickly outgrown if the business expands rapidly.
Need to purchase add-ons for any job costing/quoting work.
No offline access, problematic if the internet is down or unreliable.
Payroll is an additional cost.
Segment reporting is not as user-friendly as MYOB or Moneyworks.
Xero is ideal for labour-only contractors or those who don’t have standard quoting for materials or a need to cost out/track job expenditure.
MYOB
MYOB’s cashbook option is the cheapest online tool on the market.
Pros
Includes job costing tools in AccountRight package.
Has traditional offline access and online options, as well as a hybrid package.
Includes payroll (other than cashbook option).
Mobile app available.
Cons
Not as well established as Xero in online services.
May require a higher level of accountancy knowledge to operate.
Add-ons are not as widespread as Xero options.
It’s not as user-friendly as Xero.
We think MYOB is best suited for those who scope out all aspects of a job when they quote, as it offers better functionality in this regard.
The all-in-one package allows for less complex reporting and lower cost.
A good mid-range system for a growing business, it also has a wide product range to support different business sizes.
Moneyworks
It’s the most comprehensive system on this list, but does require users to have a good base knowledge of accounting.
Pros
Reporting on a job-by-job basis. Provides the ability to track each job – profits or losses – on a daily basis.
Includes job costing in package plus measuring quotes vs actual results.
No limit on the number of companies used per licence.
MoneyWorks Trades Plug-in – an extension that allows for the importation of price books and invoices generated by the major trade suppliers in New Zealand.
Online and offline options available.
Reports are more customisable than MYOB, although there are charges associated with this.
Cons
The least user-friendly option.
Optimal job costing requires an add-on.
Harder to correct user errors.
Pricing is not on a monthly subscription basis. A one-off outlay is needed, it requires more cash up front.
Once up and running, a business would not outgrow this system in a hurry.
However, the user would need additional training in order to get the most from it. Upfront pricing may put some people off.
Points to remember
This is a very high-level review of only a few of the software options currently available.
There are, of course, many others on the market that should be considered before deciding on a new system.
The major point is that you will need to do a bit of research or discuss options with a business advisor, in order to ensure that you have the best possible system in place to meet your needs.
While the information above is not meant to be exhaustive, each system has its own positives and negatives. In particular, job costing usually requires the use of an additional service.
A key point to remember is that these are accounting systems – not necessarily building software systems. Finding what works best for your business is crucial.
If you do have any further questions about what software your business should be using in order to reduce the number of hours you are spending in your office each night, please contact Peter van der Heijden at peter.vdh@crowehorwath.co.nz or your local Crowe Horwath advisor.

There have been a number of stories in the media about Kiwi employers taking advantage of migrant workers’ lack of knowledge surrounding New Zealand law. While most employers wouldn’t do so knowingly, avoid the error by ensuring you understand your responsibilities as an employer
Migrant workers can help fill labour and skill shortages in the construction sector; however, it’s essential that employers grant these workers the rights they are entitled to under New Zealand’s employment laws.
Immigration New Zealand provides direction on migrant workers’ rights and simple tips on how to handle any confusion that may arise in its helpful guide Are You Employing Migrant Construction Workers ?
Over the next few issues of Under Construction , we’ll continue to feature content from this guide.
Having a written employment agreement may be new to employees from other countries.
It is important to provide migrant employees with a clearly written employment agreement. This will help reduce the risk of misunderstanding.
Migrants may also want to study their signed written employment agreement to familiarise themselves with New Zealand employment conditions, such as work hours, leave entitlements and public holidays.
Even if you agree and sign a contract saying a person is a self-employed contractor, this will not legally be the case if the situation is not genuine. If a person is an employee, then he or she will have employee rights under the Employment Relations Act and other employment laws. If it is found that the relationship is not genuinely a self-employed contractor situation, you will be liable for all employment entitlements owed.
If you, as the employer, control when and how the work is done, provide the equipment, have the power to hire other people to do the work, and the person working for you is not genuinely operating a business in their own right, it is most likely you have an employment relationship with that person and your obligations under employment law must be met. For more information visit: dol.govt.nz/nzworker-type
Many migrant workers are not used to having the right to take at least four weeks of paid annual holidays/leave once they have completed a year of employment. They may not know about their entitlement to 8% of their gross earnings if their employment is less than one year.
If you employ migrant workers on a fixed-term agreement of less than one year, or as a casual worker with intermittent or irregular work patterns, they can agree to have 8% of their gross earnings added to their regular pay instead of receiving it when they end their employment or take holidays. However, you need to specify this arrangement in their written employment agreement and the amount of annual leave/holiday pay advanced in each pay period must be recorded as a separate identifiable amount from their wages. For more information, go to: dol.govt.nz/nzholidays1
Some businesses and construction sites close for a defined period over the Christmas/New Year break. It will be important to ensure new employees are informed if this is the case, particularly if they have not been employed long enough to have accrued sufficient leave entitlements to cover the period.
In such cases, you should ensure workers know whether they will be paid for the entire period. For example, some employers allow new workers to anticipate leave not yet earned to cover the closure period.
Some migrant workers may need to accumulate their leave to make a visit to their homeland worthwhile, or they may have emergencies that require leave flexibility, due to the distance from family.
Migrant workers will understand public holidays, but they will need to know when New Zealand public holidays occur. If they work on a public holiday, they may not know about their entitlements under New Zealand employment law – time and a half for the hours they work. If the public holiday falls on a day they would normally work, then they are also entitled to another day off. These entitlements may be completely new to migrant workers.
“It’s important to provide migrant employees with a clearly written employment agreement to help reduce the risk of misunderstanding
In New Zealand, employers and employees can agree to transfer the observance of a public holiday to another working day to meet the needs of the business or the individual needs of the employee. An employer and employee should make the agreement in writing. For workers who may want to exchange public holidays for their own religious holidays, please go online at: dol.govt.nz/nzholidays2
Migrant workers will need to have sick leave entitlements explained to them. The five days’ paid sick leave each year after they have been employed continuously by the same employer for six months is straightforward. But they may not realise that their sick leave can be used when they are sick or injured, and also when their spouse or partner, or a person who depends on them for care (such as a child or elderly parent) is sick or injured.
Bereavement leave is a challenging area for migrant workers, as they live so far from family and home. It is often unrealistic for a migrant worker to take their entitlement of three day’s leave after six months employment to fly home to family. However, they may need this time to grieve and it is important to make sure they know that this paid leave can be taken for the death of their spouse or partner, child, brother or sister, mother or father, grandparent, grandchild, or parent of their spouse or partner. Some cultures consider cousins as ‘brothers’ so you may need to explain that for other bereavements they may be entitled to one days’ leave.
Most migrant workers will be aware of the adult minimum wage rates. They are usually informed about this as part of the immigration information they receive and they know the rates are reviewed every year. To see the current rates, go online at: dol.govt.nz/nzwages
Migrant workers come here to earn and it is helpful to explain their payslip to them. Any deductions from their pay need to be explained carefully and agreed to by them in writing. It is helpful for them to know about deductions required by law (such as PAYE) tax that do not require their written consent.
For more information on employment relations, pay, holidays, and health and safety, go to the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment’s website or call the Ministry’s helpline.
Migrants can also call MBIE’s helpline – 0800 20 90 20 – and can request ‘Language Line’ if they want an interpreter.

Business coach Graeme Owen asked builders about the problems that can arise when working with substandard electricians; here are some tips to help you sort the wheat from the chaff
To help identify what to look for in subcontractors, I asked a number of builders, as an example: “what’s your number one frustration when dealing with electricians?”
The most common frustrations were:
Leaving a mess Those surveyed said that subcontractors who don’t pick up after themselves are an issue, because they threaten their reputations running clean and tidy work sites.
Threatening structural integrity By drilling and cutting into structural elements, a bad electrician can compromise a building’s strength. Examples included incidents where sparkies notched studs and beams rather than centre drilling.
Ruining great finishes Another common complaint was that they didn’t take care to perform their work to the same standard as finished work.
Examples included drilling through finished aluminium worktops, not fixing switches at the same height, damaging finished walls and smashing holes rather than neatly drilling them.
This led to delays on site, whether it was because of newbies making mistakes or electricians overlooking important fittings in prewire.
It’s not all bad Some builders surveyed, who’d had complaints in the past, said they now had a great electrical subcontractor on whom they could rely. So what did these builders do to get such a good run?
Here are five things we found that can make a difference:
1. Work with subbies you know
Put a process in place to ensure you only engage the type of subcontractors you want to work with.
Start by doing a reference check. Hiring a subcontractor should be no different to hiring an employee. After all, they can have as big an impact on your reputation as any employee, possibly more so, so getting it right at the beginning is essential.
2. Require accountability
There is an old saying that goes, “you don’t know what you don’t know”.
If you don’t inform a subcontractor about what you want done, then you are destined to get only what they think should be done.
To make expectations clear, create a checklist that outlines what you want your subcontractors and their team to do. Include it with the documents you send when you engage them. You may even require that a completed checklist be included with any invoices.
Ensure that your site supervisor has spare copies of any checklists, so they can check them off at the end of each job. It’s also a good idea to include what type of behaviour you expect on your site and other rules of conduct, such as parking, tidiness, customer communication etc.
By doing this, you’re making it clear that you have a standard of performance you expect them to meet. You might feel this will put some subcontractors off dealing with you, but the good ones won’t mind. They will understand why you’re doing it and, most likely, already be doing it anyway!
3. Plan your schedule
Supplier and subcontractor delays are one of the largest scheduling problems builders face – especially ones that occur on short notice. Finding fill-in work for carpenters is not easy, and almost always eats into profit margins. Consequently, keeping subcontractors on time can have huge financial benefits over the long haul.
When you’re setting up your job schedule, make the start date for subcontractors as early as possible. This way you create a buffer in case there are any delays. Where appropriate, schedule carpentry to coincide with when the subcontractor is on site. Then, if your subcontractor is delayed, there is less impact on your time schedule.
4. Regular updates
Just as you plan work targets with your employees, do the same with your subcontractors. Call them regularly (even daily) and ask them about their target for the next day/week. Ask about any problems they foresee or are having and how they will solve these to stay on schedule. Get agreement so that everyone is on the same page, then follow up.
By doing so, you not only have a better chance of keeping your job on schedule but, in some cases, you may help your subcontractors improve their performance and possibly even their profits. That has to be good for everyone.
5. No excuses!
Great subcontractors and great builders take responsibility. Make it clear that there are no excuses and that simply laying blame isn’t an option. When something doesn’t go to plan, you need to know that your subcontractor is committed to fixing it. Expect them to inform you immediately if a problem arises and to outline how they will remedy it.
It’s when these stressful occasions occur that clear expectations and accountability illuminate the way forward. Moreover, when these situations are handled professionally, strong relationships and loyalties are built.
Stick to the above and you will attract the subcontractors you want to work with – and those who will want to work with you. The result will be a strong network of subcontractors you can rely on.

A recent research exercise revealed that one of the three biggest challenges facing builders is quoting residential work correctly. Here are several tips to help you get them right
Q uoting accurately can be especially challenging for builders who have recently started their own business. Common questions include:
How do I quote correctly ?
How do I make sure that I am not going to exceed budget ?
How can I ensure that I charge a fair price and make money ?
Of course, a straightforward new home is reasonably easy to quote. The only real variable you have as a builder is the carpentry time. However, renovations, larger builds and architecturally designed homes can be quite a different story. Unique details and structural particulars can catch you out.
I am sure that you know of many cases (as I do) where a builder has underestimated the time a job has taken and lost money.
Unfortunately, there is not one solution to the problem of an incorrect quote. There are simply too many variables to consider, such as the fitness of the members of your team and how fast they work; the skill levels of your builders; the ability of your foreman to plan ahead; the scheduling of subcontractors; rework; wastage of materials etc. to say nothing of unexpected problems or weather interruptions.
Here are several things about quoting that I’ve learned:
Some builders are good at maths and love designing spreadsheets for their business, others aren’t. If you struggle with spreadsheets, then be very careful about creating your own to compile quotes. It’s so easy to make a formula error that can cost you heaps. It is also easy to confuse mark-ups, margins, charge out rates, preliminary and general, and profit percentages. What may look like a good quote that wins you the job can in fact have a negative impact on your business.
It is better to invest in a good piece of quoting/estimating software and take the time to learn how to use it well.
Just because a client asks for a quote on a renovation, or a complicated build, doesn’t mean you have to give them a fixed-price quote. It may be better to give them an estimate of overall cost and then quote your rates.
This is especially true if you are not experienced in such jobs. In that case, you are probably better to spend your time showing your client why an estimate with quoted rates is a better option for them.
Sometimes there are parts of a job that you are unable to quote accurately. It may be that you simply don’t have the expertise, or that there are too many variables.
Should this be the case, then don’t be afraid to separate the uncertain parts from the fixed part of your quote. Give those uncertain parts a rough estimate (if you can), but make sure that your client understands which is which.
There is no argument that correct quantities are important for developing accurate quotes – that and spot on labour forecasting. You can ensure that you have accurate quantities by paying for a professional quantity surveyor to help on your jobs.
Instead of labouring over numbers and quantities you’re not sure are right, spend the time more profitably improving the other components of a great quote. For example, reviewing the plans and coming up with the best build processes so you can reassure the client you really are the best choice of builder.
Also, as a result of pouring over the plans, you may well be better equipped to assess whether or not your team can complete the job in the hours the QS has estimated. Or, whether you need to allow more time because of the complexity of certain construction details you suspect will take your team longer.
Henry Ford said, “history is bunk,” but a contemporary of his also said, “those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it” (George Santayana).
And how true this is in a building business. For example, the builder who heads straight into the next job without back-costing the previous one is highly likely to repeat any mistakes in the new job.
Back costing is the only way to get real information about the performance of yourself and your team. If you estimated 500 hours for a job and it actually took you 650, then next time around you should allow 650. You would adjust your estimating formulae.
It sounds like common sense, but I have met builders who keep estimating with the same formulae – after they have lost money! They then wonder why they are not making a profit.
While it may be time consuming, it’s worth the effort to back cost every quoted and estimated job. By doing so, you build up a record of your team’s performance so you can estimate jobs more accurately in the future.
Getting your quoting right is really important in building a long-term secure business. So make sure that you don’t leap into giving quotes just to stay in the game. Doing so may put you out!

What can birds teach builders about marketing? How to get your brand out there!
Do you need to “get your brand out there”? Most people agree that online marketing can make a huge difference, but there’s less consensus about which platform is best for builders. Talking to others doesn’t remove the confusion, because they all have different stories, and few of them are doing it successfully.
So which online marketing platform(s) should you use? Facebook?  WhatsApp? LinkedIn? Instagram? Twitter? Google+? Pinterest?  YouTube? Tumblr?
The most important thing to realise is that the answer won’t be the same for everyone – the best online marketing platform for you is the one that your prospective clients are using.
Now, that’s what we at Successful Builder call a BFO – blinding flash of  the obvious!
When you engage in the communication channels that your prospects are using, you are way more likely to find yourself getting in front of them. And vice versa. No matter how popular a medium may appear to be, if it’s not popular with your prospective clients, it’s of no use to you. For example, even though the Yellow pages are still used by millions of people, business owners seeking clients in major cities find advertising in the paper version of Yellow Pages a waste of money (since very few people in major cities use them!).
So rather than starting with the “which marketing platform?” question, it may be better to start with the following:
What do I want to communicate?
To whom?
Once you know the answers to these questions, you can go looking for  the best online platform.
All about Allbirds
This is where the birds enter the article! Allbirds – to be precise. Heard of them? Of course!
One of the fastest growing companies in 2015 and 2016 and rated by Time magazine as creating the world’s most comfortable shoe. Their vision was to be fun, cool, sexy, good quality and environmentally caring – a reflection of them as people.
Their target was younger people, but there are hundreds of other shoe brands in that market. They needed a platform that would give them opportunity to communicate authentically and put them in front of their target market.
They chose Instagram. Predominately the medium of younger people, with its special provision for high quality pictures and video. Instagram provided a space where they could showcase where they sourced materials, how customers could style things with their shoes and their commitment to quality, using the medium popular with younger people – photos and videos.
It worked brilliantly, growing the Allbirds brand to international status in a very short time. (By the way, if you think I’m talking about an avian phenomenon, then you probably aren’t interacting with Instagram).
When Allbirds told their story and shared their passion and vision, they were communicating their passion and their vision to their target market – younger people (according to Statista, 71% of active users of Instagram are under the age of 35 years).
They inspired them to purchase because people buy from inspiring people. So while at least a dozen knock-offs started soon after Allbirds, these were not able to match the story, passion and vision of the Allbirds founders and their marketing seemed lifeless in comparison. They found that people wanted to buy from them. As a medium for inspiration, warmth and human stories targeted at younger people, Instagram suited the Allbirds’ marketing plan perfectly.
So, like Allbirds, there are tonnes of others in your market. People could buy from any one of them. But some will want to buy from you – because you are you! It’s the uniqueness of you that makes your company different! So choose the medium in which your target is active and tell them about you – your passion and vision. If you are targeting a younger market, then Instagram could be for you.
So, let’s assume that you are doing the basics: signs outside jobs; letterbox dropping neighbours; keeping in touch with previous clients and contacts; but you want to raise the stakes. Then it would be good for you to do the following:
1.Clarify the demographics of your target client
Are they single, parents, middle class, professional, older or retired? Do they have children, teenagers, grandchildren or parents living with them? One income or two? City or suburban?
2. Decide what it is you want to communicate to them
What is the main need or frustration that your service alleviates? How can you help them? What do they need to do to start the process – download a pdf, send an email or call you?
3. Find out the online medium(s) in which your target market is active
You may need to do some research here. You could survey people in the demographic, or get in touch with a local expert for advice. Then create your marketing!
If you don’t have the time, skills or inclination to carry out such a marketing campaign, contact a local marketing expert and get the assistance you need. But first, make sure that you are very clear on the who, the what and the where before you agree to an expensive online marketing campaign.
Remember, people buy from people! So don’t be afraid to inject your personality into your marketing!

The Inland Revenue has begun a campaign targeting cash jobs (‘cashies’) in the trades – it pays to know where you stand
M any people working within the building industry will have received a letter from the IRD notifying them of its latest target area – ‘cashies’.
While some may view it as an unfair notice, others could be feeling a sense of discomfort about what used to be standard practice in the building industry. So, what’s wrong with doing a cash job ? What are the risks involved and what are your responsibilities ?
When it comes to doing a cash job, the most obvious loser is the IRD. Cash jobs aren’t declared as income; therefore, no income tax, ACC and GST are paid on the amount earned.
“Who cares ? ” some might say. “It was only a couple of grand, what’s the harm ? ”
If every taxpayer got a ‘couple of grand’ tax-free in their pocket, it would quickly become a huge problem for the country. It would also be hypocritical, given that a common complaint among New Zealanders is that high-income earners don’t pay their share of taxes. Furthermore, cash jobs aren’t just a simple matter of saving on a tax bill, as there are a number of issues associated with them.
Risks of cash jobs
Those who get into the habit of doing cash jobs run the risk of not being paid ACC. While ACC may be viewed by some as just another tax, it is extremely important should a workplace accident occur – not an uncommon occurrence in the building industry.
If you are injured and cannot work, payouts by ACC are based on your previous year’s earnings. If you’ve done quite a few cash jobs, earnings will have been under-reported to the IRD. As a result, if you are injured and can’t work, the ACC payment you receive won’t reflect your true income, which could lead to financial hardship.
Another risk of cash jobs is, quite simply, the IRD’s interest in them. The IRD usually has a number of tax dollars that it aims to collect when it embarks on a new campaign. In order to meet target amounts, the IRD will closely scrutinise the construction sector through audits and reviews.
Even if the IRD finds no issues, it can still be a costly exercise for the company or person being reviewed. Not only are there expenses involved with having an accountant liaise with the IRD, there are also financial and health costs incurred due to time away from work, stress and late nights at the office.
If the IRD finds income that has not been declared, the person involved could expect to pay shortfall penalties, interest and the unpaid tax amount. The IRD will also put a ‘red flag’ next to that person’s name, which could prove problematic when it reviews future tax returns.
Your responsibilities
The majority of tradies may be offended by the IRD’s current focus on this area. Many honest people in the construction sector follow the rules and pay their taxes. Those people have nothing to worry about. Should the IRD request information, they will be able to provide it easily and no action will be taken.
However, there is always a group that ruins it for the rest and the information gathered from the campaign’s pilot program in Auckland suggests it’s a significant issue. According to a recent front-page article in The New Zealand Herald , 25% of Auckland construction jobs are paid for off the books.
Of these, 57% were initiated by the homeowners, who usually view it as an opportunity to get a discount. They can’t claim the income tax deduction or GST on the payment, it’s just a way to get something done cheaper.
If you find yourself in the position of being asked to do a cash job, keep in mind the risks of accepting:
1) Can you afford to go through an audit ?
2) Can you afford the potential issues and loss of income, if you are injured ?
3) Do you want the gaze of the IRD permanently on your business ?
If you don’t want to take the risk, politely refuse and issue a quote. If you don’t get the contract, you will still be in a far better position than if you had done it and been caught. Let someone else take that risk and spend your time on legitimate work.
This scenario is not too dissimilar to discounting work in order to win it. If you discount too far, the job becomes unprofitable and results in wasted time, energy and money. So, why do essentially the same thing with cash jobs ?

Most builders I meet would love to become millionaires – and some get there. You’ve heard the expression ‘failing to plan is planning to fail’; could it be that millionaires plan better than others?
I t’s not that simple, everyone plans – it’s just the time scale they plan on is different.
Employees (often) plan for a day
Often, those who work for a boss don’t have to concern themselves too much with the business’ long-term goals – they have a plan for the day and, as long as they complete the work required, they can head home and not think any more about it.
Not all employees take that approach, particularly those who are looking to move up, but usually a perk of being an employee is you’re able to concentrate solely on the task at hand.
Managers plan for a week
Things change when the employee becomes a manager. It’s not quite as easy to get by on daily planning, and it’s harder to avoid taking work home with you.
Rather, since they are responsible for organising work for employees, managers need to be a step ahead. They need to plan at least a week in advance to ensure their employees have all the direction and resources necessary for efficient work day by day.
It’s harder to plan a week ahead, and not every manager succeeds. Have you ever watched a project manager who is still acting like an employee ? They spends the day fighting fires, chasing up late deliveries and subcontractors.
Jobs run late. Materials run short. Subcontractors can’t turn up and variation and change orders get overlooked. Their projects run overtime and over-budget.
That’s simply because they haven’t yet learnt to plan far enough ahead. Successful managers plan at least a week ahead. Then, when something goes wrong, they have time to intervene, resolve the problem and get the project back on track. Managers learn to plan further ahead, and get paid more for doing so.
Business owners plan for the month
You might think that becoming a business owner is as simple as getting a client and working for yourself. It’s easy to start. But it’s not so easy to finish well, and a high percentage go back to working for someone else. Why ?
Because owning your own business means that you need to think much further ahead than you did when you were an employee or a manager. If a manager thinks ahead a week, then a business owner thinks at least a month ahead.
Things that are urgent are put aside in favour of things that are important. Important things are the tasks that don’t need to be done today, but can be done tomorrow – eg, updating the website, or posting on Facebook.
However, tomorrow never comes, so business owners need to learn to identify important tasks as urgent and do them now.
They value time and priorities differently. The work they do today, as a business owner, may not reap immediate rewards, but it will bring benefits next month, or the following month, or even next year. For example, pricing a job for next year today makes no difference to today’s income, but it makes a difference to future income.
Successful business owners delegate the urgent (immediate) stuff to their team of employees and managers. They know that they need to focus on the long-term business plan.
And, because the important stuff is rarely urgent, the business owner (ideally) gets to take time out to watch the rugby, take the family on holiday, go fishing or even play golf!
However, unlike employees and managers, business owners (especially of SMEs) rarely get to check out completely – there’s always the chance they may get a call about an urgent matter they need to deal with.
Millionaires plan for a year
Not all business owners go on to become millionaires, but those who do seem to have at least one thing in common – they make the effort to plan well ahead, for at least a year.
And then, once they have the plan in mind, they arrange their immediate tasks in light of that longer-term plan. Sure, it takes time, effort and practice to learn to do this – but it can be mastered.
The thing about longer term planning is that it doesn’t need to be perfect. You can’t predict the future accurately, so the important part isn’t the detail, it’s the concept.
If being a millionaire is your goal, make foresight top of mind. Millionaires don’t necessarily have fewer problems or better plans than anyone else (although no doubt it would help), but they definitely think long-term.
The lifestyle they enjoy today, grows out of the future they planned yesterday.
As Warren Buffet once said, “Someone is sitting in the shade today because someone planted a tree long ago.”

Debating whether an accounting system is the right choice? Crowe Horwath outlines how it can improve your business processes and help with forecasting.
We’ve seen it all before, right? A company with high sales, decent profits and lots of guys doing the dirty work while the owner oversees the operation; all of a sudden, the employees are gone, the business has fallen over and the owner is left to work off numerous debts to creditors and the IRD for the rest of his days. Where did it all go wrong?
While that question can’t be answered simply, one thing is for certain: the better a business’ accounting system, the less likely it will fail.
There is now a range of systems available to business owners. More than ever, they can be moulded to suit your business, rather than the other way around. From Xero to MYOB and from ‘the cloud’ to the desktop, the options are varied. There are no longer any excuses for not knowing how your business is tracking.
Want to reconcile your bank transactions in the shortest time possible? No problem! Need to prepare quotes and email them directly to your customers? Easy! GST returns at the push of a button? Of course! How about a system that allows you to prepare and email invoices to your customers on your smartphone without leaving the site? You can do that, too. Put simply, these accounting systems can revolutionise your business.
Modern accounting systems can provide you with an up-to-the-minute, year-to-date profit figure, GST position, cash balance and more. Some can even provide you with an immediate reconciliation between the amount you’ve charged for a job, and the amount you have left in your budget. This is extremely powerful information and can help to plan future tax payments, as well as organising invoice payment and receipt dates – all crucial for businesses at any stage of their lifecycle.
“Put simply, these accounting systems can revolutionise your business
If your business already employs budgeting, most systems can incorporate these and you can track your performance on a monthly, quarterly or bi-annual basis. The benefit of being able to drill down into specific areas of concern – without having to dig through records in your office – is invaluable. Conversely, if you don’t have a budget, the systems can help you set one up.
Online accounting systems can help you answer all sorts of questions:
Can I afford to pay all my creditors this month?
Am I being too lenient on my debtors?
Is buying that new ute on hire purchase a good idea?
The ability to understand your business – the impact of late payers, the opportunity to plan out your expenditure during lean times and the chances available during the busy times – is absolutely priceless. The value of real-time information means you and your accountant can both look into the cloud at any time, from any location and adapt instantaneously.
“The better a business’ accounting system, the less likely it will fail
A common issue among business owners is the time spent at the end of the day reconciling their bank accounts, preparing invoices and chasing up debts. During busy periods, these processes can often run into the small hours of the morning; before you know it, you’re back out on the tools and doing it all over again.
The most precious commodity of any business person is time. The old saying ‘time is money’ has never been more accurate. The more time your spend managing your own financials, the less time you have to quote for new work, find new clients, review processes and profitability on current projects and, of course, spend time with family and friends.
Modern accounting systems can help put an end to, or greatly lessen, the long nights spent in the office. If you’re harnessing the right systems for your business, you no longer have to be a slave to bookwork. If you aren’t already harnessing the power of these accounting systems, you’re only short-changing yourself and your business.
So, do yourself and your business a favour and look into getting an accounting system that works for you – the insight and opportunities are abundant.

With construction booming in many parts of the country, it’s likely that a number of carpenters and builders will be thinking about starting out in business for themselves – but how can they be sure they’re ready?
T wo common questions I get from those looking to strike out on their own is ‘what do I need to prepare ? ’ and ‘how will I know I am ready ? ’
Some builders would say you start by getting a great business name, logo, business cards and a business account. Others would add a signwritten vehicle, marketing materials and some friends and relatives who will give you enough work to get started on your own. All of these are good recommendations, but they certainly aren’t the only things worth considering.
I’ve met people who, in spite of doing all of the above, have not started well and I’m sure you’ve heard similar stories. Maybe they started too soon, or didn’t get it all together in time, or maybe there were other essentials missing.
So, how will you know if you are ready ?
1. You can handle change
Leaving the routine of paid employment to start out in business undoubtedly involves change; an obvious one is the way you’re paid.
No longer will your employer pay you regularly. Instead, you will be paid directly by your customers, and not necessarily on a consistent basis. You will need to change your preconceptions about money, where it comes from and how you manage it.
Then there is change in the nature of your work. As an employee, you worked in a particular area. If you were on the tools, then that may have been all you did each day.
However, as a business owner, you will be responsible for finding, pricing and tendering work, organising a team, administering the business and handling the money.
Furthermore, you will need to alter your view of time. As an employee, someone likely told you where to work and what to do. As the business owner, it’s your responsibility to decide when to work and how to spend your time. Changes here often require a radical rethinking of priorities.
2. You see opportunity in adversity
Adversity is an essential ingredient for success. I have yet to meet a successful business owner who hasn’t had at least one thing go wrong. It just seems to be in the rules! Being in business almost always means experiencing adversity at some point.
It’s not simply about enduring adversity. Rather, it’s about re-interpreting adversity and seeing it as an opportunity. In almost every case, success lies on the other side.
As an example, let’s say you cannot attract enough good team members. If you accept that as a given, then your business can’t possibly grow. However, if you persevere and try until you find a way through, you will have learned how to attract good team members: when the challenge arises again, you’ll know how to deal with it.
3. You balance risk carefully
Jim Rohn (one of the fathers of modern day business development) said: “If you’re not willing to risk the unusual, you will have to settle for the ordinary.”
Setting up a business has risks attached, including money, reputation and time. In the early days you may have less disposable cash and you’ll likely be fairly busy, meaning relationships – with friends and/or family – could suffer.
Weighing up risk is important. You may want to engage some professional assistance to help you through the start-up phase. You may also want to join a business networking group, to help you establish new relationships with others in a similar situation.
4. You are prepared to work on yourself
Jim Rohn also said: “Work harder on yourself than you do on your job”.
What he means is that the biggest obstacle to success in business is you – you staying the same and not growing.
Establishing a business for the first time is likely to be harder than you thought when you first set out. You may discover things about yourself that you don’t like. For example, maybe you act irrationally under pressure, or you don’t like taking responsibility for mistakes!
Working on yourself means acknowledging that the key to your business success is you, and that your personal development comes first. Work on building yourself up, so that a successful you can build a successful business.

Have you heard the expression ‘Make hay while the sun shines?’ The sun appears to be shining on our booming building industry, though business coach Graeme Owen says it’s important to make contingency plans, so resource scarcity doesn’t derail your success
Now is a great time to be a builder. Demand is high and pay rates are good. Tradespeople know their value and many are prepared to jump ship if the rewards are there for them, so attracting them to join your team, while hard, is not impossible.
While builders are thriving, the other side of the coin is that clients are beginning to recognise that there is no better time to build than the present – even if it means a higher price than if they had done the same workjust a year ago. So, there is no shortage of demand for work from clients.
Moreover, because cost-plus or charge-up contracts are now becoming more common, it is becoming harder to lose money on a job. Sure, there may be a little less gross profit than with a fixed-price contract that goes to or better than planned, and you do have to reveal your costs, but certain profit is good to have in these uncertain times.
However, as the environment is different, you do need to do some things differently. Here are some things you can do to adapt well.
1. Budget additional time to gather supplies
I am sure you are finding that managing projects is taking much more time now than in previous years. The industry in which you do business is fraught with delays and price uncertainties. As a result, organising supplies for a job can feel like a nightmare.
Whereas not too long ago a phone call could secure most materials, now you might call four or five suppliers (more in some cases) before you can get what you want – let alone when you want it. In some cases, what you want is just not available and you will need to make a substitution. This will require sign off from the client and may require a variation in design and even a new building consent. Delays are inevitable!
So, if you are spending much more time on project management than you expected, then keep a record, so that next time you prepare an estimate you will know how much additional time you’ll need to allow for sourcing supplies.
2. Hold onto small jobs
Sometimes delays and hold-ups mean that you may have to leave a job for several days, or even weeks, while waiting for critical supplies or subcontractors. This can be extremely frustrating – especially if you don’t have another project to which you can move your team. It’s in cases like this that having a few small jobs on your books – which you can start at short notice – may be just what you need to fill unexpected gaps.
So, don’t ignore the calls for small jobs, even if you can’t see yourself doing them soon. Explain your situation and add them to your waiting list. They are welcome to try other builders, but the thing is, most builders are also busy, just as you are, so it’s likely that some on your list will still be waiting for you when you have an unexpected delay.
3. Rent storage for essentials
If you have the financial resources available, it may be possible to rent a space and store some of your critical materials for future use. If you make a list of regular things that you use and are able to chip away at, and build a reasonable supply that you keep replenishing, you are less likely to run out at critical times. Sure, this is capital-intensive, but it may save you money in the long run by avoiding price increases.
4. Encourage clients to buy ahead
At a lower cost (to you) than purchasing and storing your own materials, you may want to offer a service to your clients where you purchase all their critical materials in advance. You invoice them and they pay you for them on delivery, so there is no real cost to you, and potentially a saving for your client.
Of course, clients will likely want to ensure that they have ownership of the materials if they are not stored on their property, but that should not be too difficult to arrange (talk to your lawyer).
And sure, your clients are paying in advance, but by doing so, they are insuring against at least two unwelcome situations. These are substitutions, where specific items are simply not available, and future price increases.
In fact, it may not cost them any more over the course of the build if they do this. Also, if there are no supply delays, then the actual build time may be considerably less, which could be a real selling point for a renovation.
5. Delay the start time
At the very least, you want to put off starting a job until you can be sure that you have the critical materials and the key subcontractors booked. This should likely reduce unexpected delays.
IN A NUTSHELL
The thing is, you can’t change the environment in which you do business, but you can change the way you go about working in this environment. So choose to enjoy the change, rather than fight it, and figure out how to work in it, with what you have available.

Having a happy client at the end of a job relies on getting the little things right every day, with your client and with your team
This scene might sound familiar: you have nearly finished a renovation; it’s been a long job with some difficult patches and now the end is in sight. There have been a few challenges, and you have overcome these, yet the client is showing signs they are not totally happy. Maybe some necessary variations and tagged out areas cost more than initially thought, or the schedule has gone over, but what is worrying is that the client is questioning every dollar spent and talking about holding back payments. Why would they do that?
You have done your best – even more in some cases. But the relationship has soured. It’s difficult and you wonder if you will even have the courage to ask for a testimonial. What will they say? It might not be flattering.
Wouldn’t it be better if, in spite of the building challenges that all builders experience, your client would rave about you and tell all their friends? Is that possible? Yes – when the client feels really good about the experiences they’ve had.
Here are some tips for making sure that your customers feel good about you and your company – right up to the end of the build.
1. Love your team
This might seem odd initially, but it has a huge impact on your client’s wellbeing. It’s where you start creating fans of your business.
When you set the example and love your team, when you focus on solving their problems, you are teaching them how to do the same with your clients. Your clients will love this! When you stand  with your team and face a problem together and walk in their shoes, they know you care about them and they learn! You are creating a winning culture.
How often I hear of builders who ‘blow up’ at their team. Something‘s not quite right, or they get a little behind. So, they ‘let them have it’. Sure, it might get them going for a time, but it builds up resentment, and it’s probably the number one reason carpenters change employers (a popular employers’ bestseller is titled Love ‘Em or Lose ‘Em.).
Creating clients who love your company starts with you creating a team who love working for you. So, practice building great rapport with your team. Show them you respect them and, when there is a problem, don’t humiliate them. Deal with it in a way that leaves them feeling valued and respected.
2. Major on the minors
A wise sage once said, “it’s the little foxes that spoil the vines”. I think this is teaching that the repetition of lots of little annoying things causes much more frustration than a bigger one-off problem. So, teach and resource your team to be aware of the little things that annoy clients. Then teach them to do the little things that show your clients how you go about overcoming those things. Most importantly, teach them to do it regularly.
A great build experience is built on lots of little things done well repeatedly. For example, ensure that your team is practiced at turning up on time and always doing what they promise. Maybe you can help the foreman on a renovation job to plan well, so your team doesn’t destroy the garden. Or, give your guys the tools, training and time to ensure that the job site is kept tidy.
But with all of these little things, do it more than once. Make them habitual – build them into your regular weekly reporting processes. The expenditure on these ‘little things’ – these caring routines – will pay off in the end.
3. Communicate clearly
There is no question that when your client receives less than what they expected, they will be disappointed.
When you estimate a job at $100,000 and it finishes up at $115,000, they will not like paying the difference. Even though you said it was an estimate and the $115,000 is justified, they will still be disappointed, because they heard $100,000.
What you say and what your client hears can be two very different things. So, in order to communicate clearly, check what your client has heard you say.
For example, after presenting an estimate, you might want to ask: “Because most jobs end up costing x% (10% – 25%) above the estimated amount, do you still want to proceed knowing that it is  possibly going to cost more than the quoted amount?”
Or: “The completed job is very likely to cost x-amount extra, because of all the things we haven’t built into the estimate. Will this additional expenditure of x-amount be a problem for you?”
Or, when discussing a variation or change order, write it up and have your client read it carefully before signing, so they know precisely how much extra they will need to pay.
Having a good management system that updates expenditure and likely final cost can remove doubt and ensure clear financial communication.
4. Right or wrong – see it from your client’s perspective
When a customer tells you or a team member that they are not happy about something, do you or your team member immediately spring to the defence?
It is much better to listen carefully and recognise that your client is telling you how they are feeling about the service they are experiencing. It’s an opportunity for you to see things from their perspective. They may be right, or they may be wrong. Either way, being right or wrong is far less important than feeling valued.
If they are right and you agree to a change, or if they are wrong and you respectfully show them where, then you have won a friend. Clients who become friends become fans and make great referrers.
Takeaway
Ask yourself – what one thing can you implement right now that would help your client feel better about your company?

Since the Health and Safety at Work Act 2015 came into effect, many builders have expressed frustration at how much they have to do to comply – but it doesn’t have to be so hard
A company’s culture is at the heart of health and safety. You can put in place the required documents and processes, but if you don’t achieve culture change, it’s going to be a long and hard road to compliance. It is as much about creating a culture change as it is about implementing new processes and paperwork.
Company culture is more than just ‘it’s the way we do things’. It may be documented, but probably isn’t. Getting long-term culture change means getting to some of the underlying factors.
The Circle of Thought
Put simply, the Circle of Thought states that:
Results come from Actions taken.
Actions come from Choices made.
Choices come from Thoughts.
Consider this example. Berny runs a small building business with a team of three. One of his builders, Jimmy, hasn’t followed new procedures and a workplace incident has occurred. This is the second time (since April) that someone hasn’t followed procedures, even though Berny told everybody about them.
Berny could tell his staff again (and again), but this time he decides to take a different approach. He draws the Circle of Thought on an offcut of plasterboard and explains the following:
Whether good or bad, results come from actions – the result in this case was the incident.
The action of not following procedure led to the incident.
Berny asked, “What choices did Jimmy make that led to the action ? ” “Every action is the result of a choice and where there is choice, there are options.”
The choices Jimmy made came from some thoughts Jimmy had. Maybe he thought he would save time ? Or maybe he thought he had a better way ? Or maybe he just didn’t think!
Thinking about choices gives us options and can prevent someone from simply repeating the same things over and over.
Berny sits down with Jimmy and the team to work with them, so they can re-think their choices.
Hopefully, when a similar situation arises again, they will consider their options and make better choices, leading to better actions and, ultimately, to better results.
Address three pivotal questions
There are many questions that will be asked when you are trying to change a culture; unless they are answered, it is unlikely there will be any long-term change. You can reduce the core questions to just three and, if you can come up with good answers to these, you should be able to overcome resistance to change.
Why do we need to change?
Simply telling your team that change is a requirement may produce compliance, but it may be grudgingly given. It’s much more effective if your team wants to change. Before beginning any major change in culture, address the ‘why’ first.
For example, help you team understand that the law now puts more responsibility on individuals to comply with health and safety requirements. Everyone is responsible for site safety and not simply the company alone. Not changing could have significant consequences for them as individuals, and you want to ensure this doesn’t happen to your team.
Where is this change taking us?
Create a vision of a better future. Outline how the changes will make for a better environment. People need a rough idea of what the new health and safety culture will look like before they can buy into it.
For example, help your team understand that a safe site is also a tidy and more efficient site. It can also be a good advertisement to your client’s neighbours, leading to more enquiries and more work.
How will we get there?
It’s good to understand the reasons and great to have the vision but, without the plan, nothing will change. Let your team know how you will arrive at the new culture.
It may be that you can work on developing the plan together. However you achieve it, you must end up with a workable plan that is owned by your team.
Producing a safe, tidy and effective site may require a change in your team culture, but when that change becomes entrenched the results are beneficial to everyone.

Change is in the air. I think we’d all agree that we live in uncertain times. However, while it is unwise to make rash assumptions about timing, it seems that the residential construction sector is on the cusp of an upturn. In this article, Builders Business Coach Graeme Owen outlines five key mindset shifts to ensure that builders aren’t just ready for an industry upturn – but primed to thrive in it!
The 2024 National Construction Pipeline Report forecasts a steady increase in construction activity. With rising government investment, a renewed focus on housing, and strong regional growth in areas like Auckland and Wellington, there’s a wave of opportunity building for those ready and able to ride it.
But success in the next cycle won’t come to those who stand still – it will go to those who prepare. For small to medium residential builders, that means shifting from a survival mindset to a strategic one. Now is the time to tune up your business. Focus on sharpening your team. Review your processes and position yourself to capitalise on what’s coming.
Mindset shifts are important, but they need to be paired with practical steps to ensure that they are fully worked out in your company. So, here they are!
Proactive sales approach
Embrace an entrepreneurial mindset. During good times, you don’t need to do much marketing to get work. Right? Many builders told me that they got most of their work from ‘word of mouth’ advertising.
What they really meant was that other people were doing their marketing for them (and even, in some exceptional cases, their sales!). People desperate to find a trustworthy builder were only too happy to trust a friend or relative’s referral. It was nice while the good times lasted but it meant that builders who relied on word-of-mouth were not in control of their business. So, when the downturn hit, they lacked the experience and systems to consistently find new work
Builders who will do well in the coming upswing are those who are upping their marketing and advertising efforts and strengthening their sales pipeline.
So, ramp up your marketing efforts, refresh your website (check out www.websitesforbuilders.co.nz if you need help), showcase past residential projects, engage on social media and increase your local presence with good signage and neighbourhood flyers.
Build good relationships with potential clients and consistently nurture your leads.
Partner with reliable suppliers and trades
You are not the only one who wants to get ahead of the coming action. Your suppliers and your subcontractors are also looking to prepare for a likely upturn.
So, view them as strategic partners rather than simply vendors. Take the time to strengthen your relationship with them. Share insights on upcoming opportunities and explore how you can work together more efficiently and competitively.
Also, it is a good time to review your expectations for subcontractor engagement. Develop your list of “rules of the game” for when subcontractors are coming onto your sites. Set out your terms and conditions in writing. Get ahead of the game while you have the time and ensure you have trustworthy and reliable partners when demand surges.
Invest in skills and talent development
Look at training and upskilling as vital investments for the long-term success of your business. Don’t be tempted to think of these as ‘costs we can’t afford’. Rather, see such investment as preparing your team for future success.
For example, give your third-year apprentice the opportunity to lead on a small job. Make them accountable for delivering a finished project. You may need to review your goal setting, planning and communication processes. Now is the time to do this, so that you are ready to delegate work – knowing it will be done to your satisfaction – so you can focus on bringing in new business.
Failure to train and develop talent will stunt your business growth possibilities. Remember that what you don’t delegate you will have to keep doing yourself.
Focus on financial resilience
It’s really important that you prioritise sustainable profit margins over merely increasing revenue. Yes, I know there are times when you have to trim profit, just to keep the team in work. But be very careful about doing this too much, as it is unsustainable in the long-term.
Review your strategies to ensure that your business remains viable. For example, make the most of promoting the additional benefits that you bring to your clients. You can add value to your quotes by drawing attention to your detailed guarantee statement. Many clients will happily pay more for peace of mind, especially when it’s backed by a clear, professional guarantee. You can provide real value at little cost. Just be sure that you can honour your promises!
Embrace innovation
Finally, be open to adopting new building practices and market trends. For example, upcoming changes to consenting rules and the way overseas building products can be used mean you may need to ‘school up’, so you can professionally advise clients with confidence.
Stay abreast of new materials that come on the market, especially those that influence longevity and sustainability. In general, clients like to know that the money they are spending with you will return long-term value.
Summary
By focusing on these mindset shifts and taking practical steps to embed them into your business, you’ll be well-positioned to ride the coming wave with confidence and control.

You’ve got a fairly reasonable building business and a team of builders or carpenters working for you, but some of them just aren’t performing up to scratch. What should you do with them? Below are some tips to help you turn things around
Whether it’s because they’re not pulling their weight or because they lack the skills you need, dealing with staff who aren’t performing as well as you’d like is a difficult issue.
Firing them is one option but in order to dismiss someone lawfully, you need to give them warnings – both verbal and written – and you are expected to give clear direction and assistance to help them improve. This is a time-consuming process that doesn’t always resolve the situation.
Finally, should you choose to fire them, you’ll have to find a replacement and there is no guarantee they’ll be better.
Creating your A-team
The good news is that improving the performance of your staff is not as difficult as it sounds, but few business owners take the time to figure out how to do it. It also costs next to nothing, meaning that the return on investment can be huge.
First, let’s define what a high-performing team looks like:
“A great performing team is a group of people who take responsibility for working together to achieve a common goal. They are capable of accomplishing their assigned tasks and understand the roles of other members.
They set and accept individual and team targets, assisting other team members as required in order to achieve their targets. Further, they learn and innovate.”
Define the culture you want in your company
Many builders prefer to avoid writing things down, especially long documents, since the right words can be elusive! However, writing up your company culture statement need not be difficult. You can start by making a list of the words you want your client to be able to say about your company, such as truthful, hardworking, committed, polite and resourceful.
Then ask your team to add words describing the company they’d love to join, such as fun, communicative, excellent, successful and consistent.
At a later date, you can add more words and a brief explanation, but I guarantee that if you talk about this with your team, they will soon come up with a list. You may even find one of them is happy to write it up!
Remind your team about your culture statement at each toolbox meeting. Get the key words printed on wallet-sized plastic cards. Print them out on a large card and nail it to the wall of each job, then tell your client that this is your company culture statement. Reward members that reflect your culture and hold others accountable. In time, you will reap the rewards.
Once you have identified your culture, use the same process to create a set of company rules. These are like the opposite side of your culture statements. They set the boundaries and define actions and behaviours you don’t want – actions that could result in immediate termination.
Focus on specific activities
Set clear and measurable achievement targets on a weekly basis (or daily for less skilled people). Don’t assume that your team members know what you are thinking. Tell them.
Ensure that team members know what is expected of them and check if their target is commensurate with their skill level.
Should a team or a team member falter, focus on ‘what would need to happen to get them back on track?’ rather than bawl them out. Help them find ways to improve by offering assistance – better tools, more supervision, written instructions etc.
Also, don’t overlook the power of providing incentives for achieving tasks ahead of schedule.
Nail it with training
Some of the more successful building companies we have worked with hold regular in-house training events for their apprentices, with qualified builders also welcome. Interest is generated by inviting suppliers to demonstrate new tools and materials.
This is also an excellent opportunity to take a few minutes to highlight one or more of your points of culture.
If you are a small team, you could combine with a colleague or two and run training events together, which also makes it more worthwhile for suppliers.
If you have apprentices, put together a list of the things you want them to master. It doesn’t take a lot, but it makes a big difference when both you and they know what they’re expected to achieve.
In my experience, companies that focus on training their team members end up with better staff. It’s not rocket science!
Create your promotional track
Some of the best building companies have clearly defined promotional tracks, attached to specific technical and leadership skill levels, along with a sliding pay scale. As a new employee gains skills and becomes of more value to the company, they progress.
Transparency provides the basis for regular reviews of performance. Moreover, because staff know precisely what is available for them at each level, the levels provide a clear incentive to learn new skills and to become more useful to the company.
These same companies look for emerging leaders and match positions to personal characteristics – as best they can.
Ask for feedback
Get feedback from your team. Ask them what they think, how they view the company and where they think improvements can be made.
Ask them what you could do to make them more productive. The bottom line of your building businesses is determined by the performance of the guys on the tools. So get them involved.
High-performing building companies don’t just happen, they emerge from environments where high-performing teams thrive.

It’s great not having to chase building work. Some builders are currently so busy that they’re turning away clients, but they’re concerned about losing out on future work by doing so
When turning down work, a busy builder’s standard response is normally “try another builder”. While understandable, it’s not the best approach. You may be turning away really good clients, meaning you’ll be forced to accept lesser ones in the future.
1. Put your prices up a little
It‘s usually true that price-conscious customers will make their decision based on the price at the bottom of the contract, or on the hourly rate quoted in the estimate. They are not interested in the other value-adds you may bring, because they don’t see any difference between builders.
By quoting higher rates, you will drive away the caller who wants any builder. At the same time, you’ll find out if your caller is discerning, and wants you and what you’re offering, because your value-add is attractive. Maybe a friend has told them that they just have to use you!
If your caller really wants you, it’s more likely they’ll be happy to pay your rates and fit in with the way you do things. These are the clients you want. They’re your “A-type” customers!
Additionally, when you raise your prices, the extra money helps cover the costs associated with preparing better estimates and more accurate quotes. It pays for better supervision, so you can meet your clients’ expectations. You can attract better builders, who will be able to finish some jobs faster and cheaper. It also helps cover the down days you might have as a result of turning away not-so-profitable work.
2. Don’t consider contracts where your track record is bad
If you back-cost your jobs, then you should know which ones you typically make a good profit on, and those you don’t. If you often lose money on fixed-price agreements, then tell your callers that you provide estimates only and that you charge an hourly rate.
Similarly, if you are good at delivering within the parameters of your fixed quotes and making money from them, then only select clients who are willing to enter into fixed-priced agreements. Find your niche.
If you choose to turn away jobs that you don’t normally make much profit on, and instead focus on securing only contracts that you know will turn a good profit, you’ll make more money while turning away less profitable work.
3. Specialise and qualify
Determining what type of contracts make you the most money can help you choose the type of work you’d like to specialise in.
Ask your caller some initial questions that will clearly determine if the job in question fits your speciality. If it does, then proceed. If not, and you’re busy, you may want to turn them away, because they see you as just another builder and you may not be able to charge your specialist rates.
If you’re a specialist in a particular area, then you’re usually able to charge higher rates. For example, villa restoration specialists are highly valued by fastidious villa owners, because of their attention to detail and special knowledge of long-forgotten building practices. Such owners will pay to get the finish they desire, but you need to be the specialist.
So, if you are a villa specialist, but your caller is clearly not concerned about the finish, you may decide not to proceed because the client doesn’t fit your preferred parameters. Qualify your callers.
Sometimes, the best way to ensure you are available for the jobs that suit your speciality and bring you the best profit is to say no to the jobs that don’t fit.
4. Require your clients to follow your process
There is nothing worse than being run around by demanding clients: attending meetings when they schedule them, answering calls at all hours, and generally being at their beck and call. Some clients seem to think of you as their personal servant, just sitting waiting for their call!
Then, in spite of the huge amount of time you have put into preparing a quote, exactly as they have requested, they choose another builder.
Save yourself the time and stress by reducing the number of quotes you lose. Clearly outline your sales process and get your client to agree to follow it. Make sure you stick to your process.
It is possible to turn away work and still make money!

As an employer it’s important you pay your payroll deductions correctly, especially where the line between employee and contractor may be blurred, which is common in the construction industry. Here’s some useful advice to help see you right come the end of the next financial year
Remuneration options are often an afterthought when hiring new staff. PAYE and withholding tax arrangements have different pros and cons, although employers can no longer choose which option best suits their business. The issue of contractors vs employees is currently a hot button with the IRD and there are serious consequences if you get it wrong.
Employees have Pay As You Earn (PAYE) tax, which includes any ACC levies, student loan repayments and KiwiSaver or other superannuation payments (all where applicable) deducted from each payment, which means unless they have any other income in their own name, their core taxes are settled by their employer. Any non-compliance with the law is a matter settled between the employer and the IRD. Employees are fully entitled to holiday pay and sick leave payments from their employer.
Contractors are initially taxed at a lower rate (the default rate is 20%), with tax, known as schedular payments, being deducted from their income by the payer. At the end of the year, an income tax return must be filed by the contractor and the contractor will either have further income tax to pay (up to a rate of 33% depending on their level of income) or receive a tax refund. They are able to claim certain expenses against their income, such as travel necessary for work, or in a builder’s case, expenses for repairs and maintenance on any tools they use in the course of their work.
Contractors are required to be GST-registered if they earn over $60,000 in a 12-month period. Contractors are not entitled to sick leave or holiday pay, and are unable to take up personal grievance claims against the business.
While there are advantages and disadvantages to each situation, the decision does not rest simply on what works best for your business.
The best way to decide how you should treat your workers for tax purposes is to consider the following:
Does the worker have the ability to work for another employer on another job while working for you? If they do, then they would fall under the contracting realm of employment.
Who dictates the amount to be paid to the worker? If the worker is planning on invoicing based on an hourly rate that they have offered to the employer, then they would be deemed a contractor. However, if the worker is paid a set rate based on the employer’s discretion, they would be viewed as an employee.
Can the worker take holidays as they wish, or is it up to the employer’s discretion? If holiday periods are dictated by the employer, then the worker is likely to be deemed as an employee.
Do they supply their own tools for work? If they supply the majority of their tools, which are not paid for by the employer via any tool allowance contribution or are expected to provide their own tools, then they would likely be deemed a contractor. An employee would not be expected to provide their own tools.
Does the worker invoice the employer for hours completed on jobs? If so, they are a contractor. Employees are paid a rate based on a full day of availability for work, whether the work is there or not. Contractors only get paid based on the hours they work.
These are just a few examples of areas that the IRD look at. And as you read through the above methods, it is easy to see why it has become a grey area for many businesses.
In certain situations, it may even be that a worker meets some of the tests for being an employee, while also meeting some for being a contractor. What is important is that all reasons for the treatment of a worker are documented, with a rigorous process being followed to determine their nature. Essentially, the less control a business has over a worker and their activities, the more likely they are to be deemed a contractor.
While contractors should supply their own tools, employees would not be expected to do so
If you have questions about how you should be paying your workers, or have any other questions regarding contractors or employees, please contact Peter van der Heijden at peter.vdh@crowehorwath.co.nz ; or contact your local Crowe Horwath advisor.  For the contact details of your local office, please visit: www.crowehorwath.co.nz/locations or phone 0800 494 569 .

With the construction industry predicted to remain strong for the foreseeable future, there should be plenty of opportunities for you to grow your business – if you go about it in the right way! Here are some tips to enable internal and external growth
A s much as it might seem to be the case in good times, businesses don’t simply grow by themselves. It’s the people in charge who determine their shape, size and stability.
That might not always be for the good: a business can look successful and then suddenly be placed into receivership due to the actions of its owner/s. Common reasons include accepting a big building contract without fully understanding how payment terms will affect cash flow, running over budget by failing to cross-check labour costs, or diversifying into a new market without really mastering it.
On the other hand, a small business that doesn’t necessarily look capable of much can achieve rapid growth. On rare occasions, this just happens, but normally it’s because there is a business owner behind it focused on development. True leaders are committed to growing their own skill sets!
Internal growth – you and your employees
Look for an area in which your business needs to improve and decide to grow as a leader in that area. If your business needs to recruit better staff, then ask yourself the question: “what do I need to do to become a better recruiter ? ”
Maybe you could check out the advertising and interviewing processes that more successful companies use and try them out in your company.
Whatever you do, focus on growing yourself first. A growing company needs a growing leader.
Every business owner knows that a growing business needs to recruit staff. The most successful also understand that it’s important to recruit the right staff – people who are a good fit for the company. Not only that – even the right people can become the wrong people if they stop growing.
Just as a tree is never static – it’s either growing or dying – productive staff members need to keep developing.
Helping your staff develop their skills and knowledge need not be an expensive exercise.
Simply running an occasional training hour, in which new products, procedures and tools are discussed or tried, is a great start. You could try asking employees to brainstorm ideas for improving productivity, and then implement and test their ideas.
You could also offer them new responsibilities that require learning – a new operations manual to study, or a course that better prepares them for promotion within your company.
If you can incorporate staff development into your company, so that promotions are filled from within, you can grow your company from the bottom. That approach carries a lot less risk than adding people at the top, where failure has more impact.
External growth – your client base
I wanted to share with you an interesting thought for growing your client base. It starts with a short anecdote.
A friend of mine is a keen ‘motor-homer’. He recently posted on a motorhome Facebook page photos of the great new look he achieved after removing, sandblasting and repainting the wheels on his motorhome. In passing, he also mentioned that he had filled the tyres with nitrogen.
He expected to get some comments on his post, and he did, but not one was about the new look – they were all about the nitrogen gas in the tyres!
My friend was surprised but, as a marketer, attentive. Has he stumbled upon a specific interest that would capture the attention of fellow motor-homers, even in passing ? Could he use this interest to gain more traction in future Facebook posts ?
The moral of this story is that it’s what people are interested in that captures their attention – the trick is understanding what that might be.
To grow your company securely, you need to gain the attention of not just new customers, but your existing ones. What interests do they have ? What words or images will cause them to give your company’s signage and advertising a second look ? What will cause them to notice you – so you will not be just another builder, but one they’ll recommend to their friends ?
It’s even better when your client’s interests match your own. A builder I work with has a client who is enthusiastic about car rallying. Since he also has an interest in motorsport, he took a two-week holiday to join his client at a particular car-rallying event.
His goal was to meet and network with his client’s friends. Not surprisingly, many became his friends and several expressed an interest in building in the next year or so. New leads gained while enjoying a common interest!
So, think about what things interest your best clients and then consider how you can connect at that level. Perhaps organise a fishing trip for a client and two or three of their friends – you could hook some new leads!

If you’re thinking about employing migrant workers, taking time to understand the differences they may face can go a long way. Guiding them through those will help them adapt more quickly, which can only mean good news for your business.
Migrant workers can help fill labour and skill shortages in the construction sector – but how well they do that can depend on how quickly and successfully they adapt to Kiwi culture, both inside and outside the workplace.
Employers can help by taking the time to familiarise prospective overseas employees with New Zealand work culture; in doing so, you can help maximise their productivity within your business.
Immigration New Zealand provides some simple tips that can make all the difference to settling and retaining migrant workers in its helpful guide Are You Employing Migrant Construction Workers?
Over the next few issues of Under Construction, we’ll continue to feature content from this guide, so that when you encounter issues, you’ll have a better idea of how to deal with them.
For some migrants, differences in language communication styles will be particularly important to consider.
Just because someone has a strong accent, it doesn’t mean they have poor English skills or can’t do the job.
Kiwis can use lots of informal language at work, including slang and swear words. This makes it difficult for migrants who have learnt very formal English, and even for migrants whose first language is English. Some workers are very offended by bad language and shouting.
Migrants often want to do well and are keen to improve. Words used on your site such as smoko, dwang, Gib board, crescent and ute might be completely new to them. You could help them learn the new words by writing them down. Employers who take the time to help their employees with language should see improvements in productivity.
For more information on workplace communication, go online at http://worktalk.immigration.govt.nz
Our Kiwi workplaces are much more informal than what many migrants are familiar with. They may not be used to discussing non-work topics, like what they did in the weekend, in the workplace.
Some migrants may find it difficult to engage in social talk, even at breaks. Lack of engagement, and possibly lack of familiarity with New Zealand humour, may make them seem unfriendly. Even the way Kiwis speak can be challenging for migrants. Some migrants may not recognise an instruction that is said in an indirect way, such as “Perhaps you could just tighten that bolt”.
Everyone works in the same way, don’t they? Yeah right! Have you ever wondered why some of your migrants work differently from you? Remember, different cultures value different behaviours and different values can affect how people think and act in the workplace.
Compared to workers from some other parts of the world, Kiwis:
Expect everyone to be treated the same.
Respect the boss, but usually speak to him or her in a relaxed way and are willing to make suggestions.
Like to work on their own, without being closely supervised.
Are willing to turn their hand to a range of tasks, not just those they were hired to do.
There are cultural differences in management style preferences. Some migrant construction workers come from countries where they are used to being told exactly what to do, and they find Kiwi workers and managers very different from what they’re used to.
Encourage your migrant workers to talk slowly if you are having difficulty understanding them.
Directly ask your migrants for their opinions or suggestions, if they do not contribute when you feel they have knowledge or expertise that is appropriate. Start with their name eg “Cheung, do you have any suggestions about how we can do this?”
Understand that if they express advice too strongly or bluntly that, may just be having difficulty understanding what is appropriate.
Make it clear when it is just a suggestion and not an instruction.
Use phrases such as “this is just a suggestion, what do you think?” or “can you think of another way we could do this?”
Be very clear when giving instructions – don’t miss steps or make assumptions about their understanding.
Provide important instructions in writing, if necessary.
Try using pictures and maps to explain things rather than words.
Use simple, direct language and explain complicated words and jargon.
Try not to swear or yell – it can cause offence.
Use a notice board, whiteboards and signs in the workplace.
Check understanding of instructions by asking your worker to repeat what they have to do – ask them, “So, what are you going to do first?”
Ask open questions rather than questions that simply require a ‘yes’ or ‘no’ response. A migrant’s culture can make it difficult to question or say ‘no’ to the boss. Don’t take advantage of this!

Employers caught exploiting migrant workers could be banned from hiring them for up to two years in light of new regulation
N ew measures taken by Immigration New Zealand to combat migrant exploitation are now in place, largely due to a study that revealed the issue is widespread in various industries – including construction.
Immigration Minister Michael Woodhouse says the measures are part of a government clampdown on employers who breach immigration and employment law.
“Migrant workers make a valuable contribution to our workforce and have the same rights as any other worker,” said Woodhouse.
“It is simply unacceptable that those employers who exploit migrant workers are still able to recruit from the international labour market and disadvantage those employers who do the right thing.”
Employers who break the law could be banned from recruiting migrant workers for a stand-down period that could range from six months to two years, depending on the severity of the case.
Condemning report
The research for the study was commissioned by six non-governmental organisations (NGO) after human rights abuses were exposed on foreign charter boats.
The results are troubling – it showed modern-day slavery is happening in several key industry sectors: construction, dairy, fishing, horticulture and viticulture, hospitality and prostitution.
According to the report, accounts of worker exploitation in the construction sector have been emerging since the Christchurch earthquake rebuild began, when it was estimated that 30,000 to 35,000 workers would be needed over a five-to-ten year period, with 50% of the workers being migrants.
Filipinos have been the number one source of labour and, as a result, are frequently victims of migrant exploitation – often in their own country first. Accounts have emerged of Filipino workers paying exorbitant recruitment fees ($3,000 to $15,000 each) to immigration agencies in the Philippines to obtain work in Christchurch. The promise of employment in Christchurch and relatively high wages of $18 to $25 an hour are seen by many as life changing and, subsequently, many entered into debt bondage in order to obtain employment. The reality for some is that they end up being exploited by recruitment agents and, subsequently, their employers in New Zealand.
In 2013, Michael Morrah, as part of TV3’s former 3rd Degree series, investigated accounts of oppressive contracts, loss of jobs and the non-payment of wages. He identified workers living in over-crowded living conditions organised by the employer and paying excessive rents – in one such case, eight people in a converted garage paid $155 each per week for accommodation.
Furthermore, some Filipino migrants found the contract they were given in New Zealand differed from the contract they had signed in the Philippines.
A key difference was the schedule of costs workers were liable for – in the vicinity of $7,700 to cover airfares, tool kits, insurance, etc. In some cases, employers said that if employees failed to complete their contract of three years, they would be required to pay a bond of $10,729. At the time, employment lawyer Paul Brown referred to this “as an attempt at bondage servitude”.
In 2014, due to an increasing number of complaints around employment practices, MBIE undertook an audit of 40 Christchurch recruitment and construction companies and found 16 to be in breach of employment laws, many of which related to incomplete employment agreements, unlawful deductions from wages and insufficient records.
Christchurch isn’t the only area that’s affected – the report also referenced accounts of exploitation among Chinese and Vietnamese migrants working in the construction industry in Auckland.
Reports from the labour inspectorate
The problem of employers breaching immigration and employment laws hasn’t gone unnoticed – in a bid to combat increasing non-compliance, the government increased the number of labour inspectors by 87% since July 2013.
Labour inspectorate southern regional manager Stuart Lumsden says exploitation of construction workers – both migrant and non-migrant – is a significant issue, and the larger inspectorate base was a direct reaction to the importance the government puts on employment standards.
“We’re seeing a lot of non-compliance,” says Lumsden. “First with the Canterbury rebuild and now with the Auckland market boom.”
To find and penalise those exploiting workers, the Labour Inspectorate takes a two-pronged approach.
Its more reactive method offers a call centre service where people can call in if they’re concerned about their own, or others’, employment standards.
The Inspectorate’s more proactive approach involves putting together a work programme each year to target specific areas based on industry trends. Inspectors will select a particular residential area, go onto work sites and conduct investigations by asking for people’s contracts, wage records and other required paperwork.
According to Lumsden, there are three prominent issues: people who don’t have valid work permits, employees who don’t have employments contracts, time or wage records, and employees who are treated as contractors.
He said those without work permits are particularly vulnerable to exploitation, as they often associate complaining with having to leave New Zealand. However, Lumsden said more and more are coming forward at the point where they’re so frustrated they plan to leave.
“When this happens, the impact on the employer who was exploiting the system and the migrant workers is two-fold,” says Lumsden. “We can make the employer pay arrears if the worker wasn’t paid properly, as well as ban them from hiring migrants for up to two years.”
These are only two of several enforcement measures that can be used by the government to dissuade or punish employers who exploit workers – migrant or not. Inspectors can issue fines for $1000 per breach, up to $20,000, or seek penalties at the Employment Relations Authority of $50,000 for an individual, or $100,000 for a company.
Bad for people and business
Lumsden says labour exploitation harms all New Zealanders and we can all help protect vulnerable workers.
“Most fair-minded New Zealanders do not support labour exploitation,” he says. “By breaking the law, such unscrupulous employers not only harm their staff, they also gain an unfair commercial advantage over their law-abiding competitors. People can help protect vulnerable workers by refusing to support businesses that exploit staff.”
Lumsden says the Labour Inspectorate encourages anyone who feels they are being exploited or who knows of people in this situation to phone the call centre on 0800 20 90 20 , where concerns will be handled in a safe environment.

Failing to keep proper site records can lead to hours of expensive arguments, court action or loss of an LBP licence. Avoid the stress and lost time and profit by keeping accurate records of your work
Contractors will know that being called back by a client with questions about the work they’ve done is a regular occurrence. Questions range from anything such as how many coats of paint were used and what the brand was, to asking the builder to fix up a crack or dent in a bench.
Answering such enquiries is a lot easier if you keep good site records with photographs and a site diary. That dent in a bench your customer asked about can be better explained if you are able to show that the bench was fine at handover by presenting the photographs that prove it.
Smartphones or digital cameras can record where framing and in-wall services are while they are still visible. They can also show how a job was done, the materials used and the condition at handover. There are plenty of apps you can use to save and organise the images for clearer site records.
Use a smartphone or camera to record:
Reinforcing layouts and in-slab pipework.
Bracing fixing.
The position of in-wall services.
The location/depth of service trenches.
Drains installed behind retaining walls.
Damaged materials delivered.
The results of bad weather or vandalism.
Use a site diary to record:
Phone calls and verbal instructions from the client, designer, building inspector or engineer – record the date, time and what was said.
When additional drawings were delivered to site.
Important verbal instructions given to staff or subcontractors, with date, time and person spoken to.
Contract variations by the project manager, designer or client.
Material deliveries, including condition – keep delivery dockets! If incorrect or substandard materials are delivered, keep a note of when the supplier was notified and when the materials were replaced.
Work progress and quality checks.
Site safety issues (there are very specific requirements around recording site accidents – see www.worksafe.govt.nz).
Moisture content readings of timber or concrete.
Problems encountered – incomplete drawings, high winds/heavy rain.
Site visitors.
Inspections – who was there, what was inspected and the outcome.
Recording these processes means that you will be able to answer any questions thrown at you. The information will be useful to the building owner and future builders doing alterations – which could well be you!
LBPs and records
LBPs failing to provide appropriate records is a common complaint made to the Building Practitioners Board. By law, LBPs working on Restricted Building Work must complete a Record of Work and provide it to the building owner and the territorial authority.
You should identify what restricted work you have carried out or supervised, even if you didn’t do all of it. You can download a Record of Work form and fill it in on a computer, but you will need to print it out before you can sign and date it.
LBPs also need good site records where on-the-job work forms are part of skills maintenance requirements. Examples include:
Introductions to a new system, product or way of working.
Receiving on-the-job training from someone more experienced.
Doing a job that is new to you, such as fixing claddings in the extra-high wind zone.

Do you look at shifts in your market, innovations in the building industry and developments in the wider economy, and get a little concerned at the way things are moving? Don’t panic – here’s how you can make the most of it!
Change is probably the only constant in today’s world and mastering it is important for ongoing business success. The ability to change doesn’t actually lie with the business, but with the owner(s).
A business can adapt – but only as fast as the owner is able. Some people love change and others find it challenging. Whatever your personal orientation, the truth is you can’t stop it taking place – it’s happening whether we like it or not. However, anything is possible once we overcome our innate resistance.
It’s a little like an America’s Cup catamaran. When the hulls are in the water, the water’s resistance limits the boat’s maximum speed. Yet when the foils lift the hulls clear of the water and overcome the resistance, the boat flies!
So how can you get the lift you need to overcome your innate resistance to change?
Clarify your vision
When did you last take an hour out from your busy schedule and rough out your vision for your business on paper?
Ask yourself, “where do I want to go?” and “what do I want my business to look like in 12 months’ time?” Going hard at your business without a clear vision is like keeping the hulls in the water. You can have heaps of power in the sails, but little forward motion.
When you set a clear picture of the future for your business, or for that matter your life, and aim for it, it greatly lifts the chances of you getting there.
Draw an organisational chart for your business, as you want it to be, and include job titles. Describe the clients you will be servicing and the nature of the work you will be doing. ‘Guestimate’ the revenues and calculate your income. Even find some pictures that look like your business at that stage and attach them to your chart.
Identify your dissatisfactions
It’s instinctive to move away from difficult situations, we do it naturally, but unless there is a decent amount of dissatisfaction, there is little motivation to move to a different situation, even if it is better.
You need to unleash the power of dissatisfaction, as it helps overcome resistance to change. Don’t be unnecessarily hard on yourself, but do note down your three biggest dissatisfactions around your business, the work you do and even your own skillset.
Social scientists tell us that dissatisfaction is a bigger driver than vision, so spend time here. The more you dislike your current situation, the stronger your motivation to do something about it.
Identify your first actions
Vision and dissatisfaction provide the motivation for change, but will never lead to success unless they’re converted into action. Good intentions by themselves amount to nothing.
Write down a short list of the first actions you will take to move you away from your dissatisfactions and toward your vision.
For example, if you need more business in the door and you have a natural aversion to doing marketing (your resistance to change), you need to:
Highlight the dismal future if this situation continues (your dissatisfaction).
Build a picture of yourself marketing your business with a great marketing plan (your vision).
Identify (and take) the first steps to start that plan.
If there is genuine dissatisfaction, a good enough plan and some well-chosen first actions, then you will overcome your natural resistance to marketing and your business will begin to benefit.
Your first action might be to make a list of previous clients and send them an email with a special offer or voucher. It may be to check out some companies that can help you build a focused website, select one and start creating the content that will be needed.
While the action itself is important, taking it is equally so. To help you stay focused here is the above summarised as a simple formula:
Vision x Dissatisfaction x First actions > Resistance to change
If you put together your vision, dissatisfaction and first actions, you can overcome any resistance to change and start heading towards your vision.

Are you driven to working long hours while the market is hot, because you need to make the most of it, but then pushed to discount when the work dries up just to stay afloat? Then read on!
There’s no question that when your workload is high, it’s hard to focus on anything other than getting the work done. The following quote, which I’ve heard from a number of builders, is testament to that:
“I’d like to make my business more secure, but I don’t have time. There’s so much work now that I’m flat-out. I don’t even advertise, yet I’m getting more enquiries than I can handle. I have to make the most of it now. I’ll develop the business when the boom is over.”
There is a way to reduce the peaks and troughs of the economic cycle. It involves learning the art of marketing your business. When you have heaps of work coming in and you don’t need to advertise, you don’t bother with marketing.
This is actually when you have the best opportunity to grow your company’s ability to connect with the market and prepare for the future. You see, you can afford to spend on growing your marketing programme now, but you may not have that luxury later on. You are most in control of your business when you have a good idea of what is happening in your market.
Learning the art of marketing begins with finding out about your market. The better you can articulate your market’s needs, the better you can design services to match and the better your advertising will connect. Take the time to find out – it will keep you in front.
In-depth market surveys are excellent, but it’s unlikely you will have the time or money to do these. Therefore, here are a couple of direct ways you can start discovering your market’s needs.
If you’re starting out, then simply utilise one of the best-kept secrets of many successful renovation companies to survey your market – drop letterbox flyers in the immediate neighbourhood of jobs you are currently doing, which make an offer to the homeowner. Or, use Facebook to have paid posts/ display ads, regionalised to your preference turning up in your target customer’s feeds.
Direct the offer at what you think is a need. Then wait and see what happens. Make a change and see what happens. As you target different needs, you will discover which ones are more prevalent.
If you have a website, then maybe spend a little time mastering AdWords. Customers like to do research online, so being knowledgeable about keywords that your customers use to search for a builder will help you reach them with your brand. Test various ads, keywords and offers to better understand your market’s needs.
If you’re not advertising and measuring responses, then you won’t know if your company is getting work simply because people are desperate or because your marketing is working.
Your company may not be connecting with the market at all. Should the economy turn, you will then be left behind. You need to keep advertising, so you know how well you are connecting with your market’s needs.
Keeping a record of what you do in your marketing builds a valuable resource. It’s a history of your market’s response to various messages at various times in the year and in the building and/or economic cycle. It’s your company’s IP.
Imagine starting a new year with a folder full of last year’s marketing attempts. You can simply repeat the things that have worked and see if you get similar results. Doesn’t take much thinking! Then focus the balance of your marketing time on new initiatives.
Sure, the market changes, but some things stay the same. Which things? No one really knows. However, over time you will discover what stays the same for your business and what requires change.
Moreover, when your monitoring tools tell you the market is starting to shift, you can adjust to meet those changes. There is no magic formula in marketing. It’s just consistent work.
Some of the biggest companies in the world limit their offerings to just a few products and services – and they become very good at them. Apple doesn’t build houses, or boats, or manufacture washing powder, it sticks to electronics – mainly computers and phones – and they are very good at it.
Similarly, in construction, bigger companies offer fewer services and are perceived as experts. Yet the local builder, who offers everything, is not, (even though he often produces a better job). Subsequently, he struggles through downturns.
So, if you wish to improve the security of your business, look at what you learn from your marketing activities and adjust your business to provide specialist services. Then:
Define in detail what you do and how.
Improve your operations, so you can deliver.
Build a value proposition that connects with your target market.
Advertise.
If your expertise is renovations, and your target suburbs have a lot of sixties and seventies basement-style homes, then you may want to specialise in basement transformations.
Alternatively, if your speciality is first homes, with an expertise in three-level terraced homes, then your target market is developers, to whom you will become the terrace construction expert.
Remember, as the market moves, you may need to modify your speciality; but your interaction with your market will give you warning of such changes, to allow you to react.
So, don’t quit advertising in a buoyant market!

With building activity gathering pace across the country, migrant workers are becoming increasingly important to New Zealand’s construction sector. It’s important for both employees and co-workers to help them adapt to our country’s workplace culture and procedures.
There is no doubt that migrant workers help fill labour and skill shortages, but it can take time for businesses to maximise the skills they bring. Judi Altinkaya, Immigration New Zealand’s National Manager for Settlement, says employers can benefit from some simple tips that can make all the difference to settling and retaining migrants in their workplaces.
“Being well-prepared for migrant workers, and their families, will help employers get the best value from them as soon as they arrive. How quickly and how well they settle into your workplace can determine how quickly that translates to your bottom line,” says Ms Altinkaya.
“We’ve talked extensively to people in the construction sector over the last year or so and what we’ve found is that employing migrants can be quite different from employing New Zealanders. Employers in the sector have found their new migrant workers may need some extra support, particularly when they first arrive in the country – even when the workers are from cultures similar to New Zealand’s. We’ve found that employers themselves also need some support in understanding their new migrant workers.”
Ms Altinkaya’s team has used the information they gathered from employers and migrant workers to put together two helpful guides.
“Being well-prepared for migrant workers, and their families, will help employers get the best value from them as soon as they arrive
Are You Employing Migrant Construction Workers?
This guide is for construction sector employers, and contains practical tips and information to help employers better understand and support their migrant workers.
Working in the New Zealand Construction Industry
This guide is for migrant workers, and contains visa information, New Zealand health and safety legislation and tips to better understand our workplace culture.
Ms Altinkaya says the amount of knowledge a migrant worker knows about New Zealand before they arrive can make a big difference in how quickly they are able to settle in to work and their new community.
“Our guide for employers describes and recommends providing migrant workers with a ‘Welcome Kit’ before they leave their home country,” says Ms Altinkaya.
The kit contains tips and practical information on a number of topics, such as our climate and clothing needs, driving requirements and food and commodity prices, as well as company information and expectations about the job.
“This is a great example of how a small investment can make all the difference to migrant workers and their families making a smooth transition to living and working in New Zealand,” says Ms Altinkaya.
“While it might seem like a lot of work to have to do before your migrant worker even arrives, it’s worth remembering that you’ll only have to put this information together once. The next time you employ a migrant, you’ll already be prepared.”
A company that provides a ‘Welcome Kit’ should also run a structured orientation programme for new migrant employees once they arrive. This will not only help your new employee become familiar with your workplace and work practices; it will also enable you to set out your expectations and should ensure that fewer mistakes are made.
Orientation programmes should include information about:
Workers’ roles and responsibilities.
Your expectations about employees’ work.
Workers’ employment rights and obligations.
Health, safety and hazards.
Language and cultural difference.
It’s good to prepare yourself for new migrant workers as well, and the guide gives helpful information about the way your migrant workers may best be managed.
“For example,” says Ms Altinkaya, “some migrants will say ‘yes, yes, yes’ and then do the exact opposite of what you have asked them to do. This is frustrating, but once you understand the problem, you can easily work in a different way. Some migrants might find simple written instructions easier to follow.”
You can also pair your migrant worker with a ‘buddy’ – someone who knows what to do and can work alongside them as they go along. It is crucial to ensure that your new migrant worker can safely operate equipment, including vehicles and machinery.
Ms Altinkaya says an important difference for employers and co-workers to keep in mind is when a new migrant worker comes on board, they may not be familiar with a lot of the language Kiwis use – slang and more informal terms – and even the names of equipment and machinery that are different.
“Migrants may have learned very formal English. While we take for granted that people will understand what things like smoko, Gib and ute are, these words will mean nothing to some migrant workers. Employers and co-workers will also need to be patient as people get used to our Kiwi accent – after all, Kiwi English is one of the least heard versions of English in the world, so migrants take a while to ‘tune in’ to us!”
It’s not only our words and accent that may cause misunderstandings. Kiwi workplaces tend to be a lot more informal than those many migrants are used to, and management styles can also differ.
“Depending on where your migrant worker is from, they may be used to being told exactly what to do, or they may not speak up unless asked directly – both concepts that are foreign to most Kiwi workers! Employers and co-workers can head many issues off at the pass by taking the time to find out about the culture in the migrant’s home country and what management style they are used to in the workplace.”
For more information on this and on what more you can do to help migrant workers settle in to your workplace, have a look at Are You Employing Migrant Construction Workers ?
It’s available on Immigration New Zealand’s Settlement Support website: www.ssnz.govt.nz/working-in-new-zealand/construction/ . Next month we’ll go into more detail about ways to make migrant workers perform to the best of their ability on your worksite.

Finding it hard recruiting good workers? Follow these tips to build a team you can trust!
Economists say construction is on the up, that we’re heading into good years and that we should make the most of it. This is great news – except that there is also a looming shortage of skilled tradesmen.
For many smaller businesses, the shortage has already hit; it’s getting harder to recruit really good builders, with competition tough and larger companies attracting good staff.
To make matters more difficult, some employees are thinking about going it alone by starting their own businesses. You may even have taken the leap yourself in a previous economic cycle.
But, to grow your own business, you need your team to stay.
The following are four keys strategies I’ve observed that help building companies attract and retain great team members.
Experienced recruiters know that qualifications, training and experience assure you a candidate has the skills required to do the job. However, they don’t assure they’re a good fit for a particular role in your company.
If you’ve been around construction a while, you’ll know that it takes a fully functioning team to construct a building and make a good profit. Although a dysfunctional team may get the job done, it’s likely to cause you headaches, reduce profits and potentially harm your reputation.
While being nice or fitting the company culture is a step in the right direction, it doesn’t necessarily ensure the candidate is a good fit for the role. For example, if you expect a builder with an outgoing personality to enjoy working alone, you will probably be disappointed. To work to their best, outgoing personalities often need to be part of a team. A more dominant personality will likely want to lead the team. Similarly, if you need someone to do your high-level detailing work, make sure you select someone whose personality is oriented towards doing things right the first time with good attention to detail. It might even be worthwhile to show them a structure with only slight detail defects and see if they can spot them easily.
Whatever your system, make sure your process matches people to their roles. Ask yourself what personality profile the role requires and choose accordingly.
The advantage in doing this is two-fold – you will have happier, higher-achieving staff and, therefore, less turnover.
To get a good idea of personality fit, you can try using one of the personality profiling tools available on the market.
Many people believe that, when the labour market tightens, you should lower the bar – they figure that anybody is better than nobody. However, this is not always true!
In most cases, it’s better to do less work properly with a small, trusted team than attempt heaps with a larger, less experienced team. You may end up with lower revenues, but you will endup with fewer problems. Higher revenues from shoddy workmanship do not usually result in more profit.
In fact, there’s really no excuse for shoddy workmanship at any time.Our country can’t afford it! Be patient and do the work required to find and employ good staff – they are out there ready to join good companies.
Go against the trend by deciding to maintain a high standard when selecting employees – by doing so, you’ll attract better builders.
There is an old saying that “if you pay peanuts, you get monkeys”. If you want to attract and retain better staff, you need to pay better than average wages. It may mean that you need to raise your charge-out rates but, if you have a team that is better than average, they should be able to achieve more per hour.
This means they’ll do more work in less time, in which case your client need not pay any more. It’s not rocket science, just choosing and training the right people.As a high-paying employer, you should soon find it easier to attract better builders.
“Take the time to get your team on board by sharing your vision for the company with them, keeping them informed of progress and dealing honestly with any problems that might arise
Most people want to be part of something that is clearly going somewhere good, so tell them about where you are taking the company. Don’t oversell, just tell them what you envisage and ensure it’s an improvement on the current situation, even if the business is already doing well. Most employees want to hear your optimism. They need to know that you believe in what you (and they) are doing, and are doing what it takes to ensure the company keeps growing and developing.
It’s also important to invite them to be part of the development – people like to feel included and be part of a business’ growth.Communication is key to any team environment. Talk about any problems your team is having – it’s highly likely your team knows about them anyway, maybe even better than you do. If you pretend they don’t exist, they won’t trust you, and it’s essential that a team trusts its leader.
So take the time to get your team on board by sharing your vision for the company with them, keeping them informed of progress and dealing honestly with any problems that might arise.
Attracting and retaining good staff in a tight market is a real possibility, but it takes courage and commitment.

In a recent survey, more than 1,000 marketers scored writing blogs as their second most important marketing priority. More than half said that creating blog content was their most powerful tool in generating online leads, which is why it’s important that you, as a builder, make blogging a part of your marketing strategy
Blogging is one of the most powerful ways to generate leads off the internet. Put simply, blogging done well increases the number of people who visit your building website. That has to be good. It’s like moving your shop window from a back lane to Main Street – a lot more people get a view of your offerings.
Another advantage is that it can set you up as the ‘go-to’ person when interested people and potential customers have a construction-related question. If they go to the internet with a building-related question that you have addressed in a blog, they are likely to find you. Should your blog answer their question – you become an expert in their eyes.
Most builders I talk to find the idea of blogging overwhelming, as they consider themselves builders and not writers.
However, as a builder, your expertise is precisely what people are looking for. Now that we’ve established how a blog can add value to your business, here are some tips to get you started.
1 Get to know your audience
Create the profile of your typical customer. Make a bullet-point list of their characteristics. Ask yourself: “what kinds of people do I want to attract to my website?”.
2 Target your content
The best blogs provide answers to the things your potential customers want to know. With your customer profile in mind, start making a second list of the questions you’d expect them to ask.
These questions will give you the topics about which to write blogs. You won’t need to start from scratch, as much of this information will already be in your head.
Just make a list of the common questions and concerns that previous customers have shared with you when they have called you for a quote. Then think about your current customers – what concerns do they bring to you?
Keep your list handy and add any new questions that you come across. New questions are great, as they are likely to be more current. You’ll find this list will prove to be immensely valuable for all your marketing work.
3 Teach them something
The purpose of each of your blogs is to tell your prospective clients what they want to know. Achieving this not only helps to set you up as an expert, but your customers will also develop a level of confidence in you and your company as being able to answer their needs. It will give you a head start when you meet your new prospect for the first time.
4 Keep it simple
Once you’ve identified a series of questions, all you need do is write down your answers and present them as interesting blogs.
Write as you would speak. Readers don’t want to read a scholarly article from an English professor, they want to hear you speaking to them as if you were in front of them answering their question in person.
5 Call to action
The worst thing a blogger can do is leave his/her readers hanging with no clear course of action open to them once they’ve finished reading.
Your blog needs to have a clear call to action. This doesn’t necessarily mean a ‘call us’ button, it could be a link to a set of related blogs, further questions, testimonials, portfolios or a helpful resource that can be download from your site. These calls to action help your readers engage with your website rather than leaving for another.
6 Analyse your blog!
Finally, record your results. Missing this step is like heading out to sea without a compass – you’d be sailing blind.
Using Google Analytics, you can measure the ‘bounce rate’ to see if people are interacting with your site or leaving it quickly.
What you learn from analysing your results will help you improve your blogging skill and consequently lead to better results from your online presence.
Tips:
Google often uses headings to reference articles in search results. So try to write your headings using terms or phrases that your potential customers enter into the search box.
If you are planning to use photos from real builds, make sure to have your client sign a consent form beforehand
If you think blogging could be valuable, but you really don’t like writing, it would be worth paying a professional writer to put your thoughts on paper

Wondering whether you’re charging the right amount for your work? Crowe Horwath explains how changes in pricing influence your profitability.
Should I be reducing my rates to win the job? Can I afford to charge ‘mates rates’? Can I undercut my competitors to win more work? Will this be sustainable long term or just attract one-off customers?
These are all questions asked, and strategies frequently employed, by New Zealand businesses operating in an increasingly competitive marketplace. But the implications of these strategies can be very damaging for the profitability of the business.
Figure 1 indicates the increase in work that is required to compensate for reducing your rates.
For example, if your gross margin (income less direct costs, such as wages, subcontractor payments and materials) is 30% and you reduce your price by 10%, you need to increase workload by 50% to maintain your initial profit.
In the increasingly competitive construction market, the efficiencies required to produce such an increase in work are very difficult and can often be the ruin of businesses.
Rarely has such a strategy worked in the past and it’s unlikely that it will work in the future. The true issue with lowering your prices is the devastating effect it can have on businesses, which may not be immediately apparent.
Often you may reduce your rates to win a substantial job, and your initial figures show that you will still make a profit on the work; however, if any additional costs are incurred, the job you thought had the potential to make your business a healthy profit could easily turn into a loss. If further jobs are needed quickly to bring in more income, a knee-jerk reaction may lead to additional price reductions and the cycle continues.
If you are following a discounting strategy, it is important to have completed the projections and understand the financial implications before proceeding.
On the other hand, Figure 2 shows the amount by which your work would have to decline following a price increase, before your gross profit is reduced below its previous level.
At a 30% margin and a 10% increase in price, you could sustain a 25% reduction in workload before your profit is reduced to the previous level… you would have to lose 1 out of every 4 customers!
However, it’s not as simple as raising prices to increase your profit. If it was, we would live in a never-ending world of price increases! Other information will be required before you settle on a pricing strategy, and if a price increase is too significant, you will lose customers.
As with reducing your rates, you need to understand the implications of all decisions that the business makes in regard to price increases.
What is most important, in our opinion, is that you have a clear pricing strategy. Understanding the competition and their prices, plus clearly documenting what you can offer to your customers in terms of value, are part of the decision-making process.
If possible, being able to test price points in a controlled environment can offer incredibly valuable information for market pricing. It’s a complex and fascinating area that is often overlooked to the detriment of profitability, cashflow and growth.
Conversely, planning for optimum pricing can drive profitability and growth for your business.
If you would like to discuss implementing this into your business planning, contact Peter van der Heijden at peter.vdh@crowehorwath.co.nz or contact your local Crowe Horwath advisor.

It can be difficult to stay competitive when the market tightens but, with some flexibility and creative thinking, it can be done! The Successful Builder Graeme Owen explains how
In the ever-changing landscape of the New Zealand new home building and renovation market, builders are facing a unique set of challenges. Many prospective new home buyers are growing increasingly hesitant to spend money on what they see as a high-risk venture and those undertaking renovation work are becoming much more price-conscious. So, you must be prepared to adapt your strategies to remain competitive and profitable.
In this article, I’ll explore some effective strategies for navigating these challenges and even (hopefully) thriving in a difficult market environment.
1. Understanding market dynamics
The first step in addressing these challenges is to understand market dynamics. In recent times, customers have become more cautious with their spending, particularly on large investments like home renovations. Economic uncertainty, coupled with rising living costs, has led to a greater emphasis on value for money and cost-conscious decision-making.
You have probably had to make some of these decisions yourself, so use your own experience to help you identify with your prospective clients’ feelings.
2. Transparent communication
Being open and honest in your communication is key to building trust and managing your client’s expectations in this environment. Don’t be afraid to be honest with your customers about the uncertainties in material and subcontractor costs. Also, be upfront about pointing out any potential risks associated with the project.
When you foster open dialogue and provide clear explanations, you reduce the possibility of misunderstandings. Furthermore, you build a stronger relationship with your client. It will help if you expand your initial consultations and fully discuss project goals, budget constraints and potential challenges before expecting any contract to be signed.
3. Flexible pricing models
Traditional fixed-price quotes may no longer be feasible in a market where material and subcontractor costs are subject to fluctuations. Instead, you may need to offer a mix of fixed and cost-plus models.
With a cost-plus contract (where the client pays the actual cost of materials and labour, plus a margin) there is transparency about the actual costs involved in the project. While this does shift some of the risk onto the client, it also means they can stand to benefit should the project run well.
Similarly, a cost-plus contract allows for greater flexibility, as the client only pays for the actual time spent and materials used. This can be particularly beneficial for projects with uncertain timelines or scope changes.
However, where there are variations from the initial specifications, make sure you keep careful details of the spec changes and, if possible, the estimated costs associated with the variation. This will prevent misunderstanding should the project exceed the estimated cost.
4. Detailed contracts
Detailed contracts are essential for protecting both parties’ interests and minimising disputes. Whether fixed price or cost-plus, they should clearly outline the scope of work, pricing structure, payment terms, provisions for handling cost increases or changes in the project scope and how supply delays will be handled.
For example, contracts should include clauses that address how cost overruns will be handled, such as requiring client approval for any additional expenses beyond a certain threshold. By establishing clear expectations from the outset, you should avoid misunderstandings and conflicts – especially in the last stages of the project. It’s also important to note that for any work above $30,000 (including GST), it is legally required to use a written contract.
5. Value-based selling
In a price-conscious market, builders must differentiate themselves based on the value they offer rather than simply competing on price alone. Emphasising the unique qualities and benefits of your services can help you justify your price – especially to customers who are looking for quality.
For instance, you might highlight your expertise and craftsmanship, your attention to detail, or your commitment to your customers’ total satisfaction. Showcasing relevant past projects and providing client testimonials is a sure way to demonstrate your track record of delivering exceptional results.
6. Efficiency & cost control
Efficiency and cost control are essential for maintaining profitability in a contracting market. You should continuously evaluate your processes and identify areas for improvement. Develop a team culture that is always looking for ways to streamline operations and reduce waste.
For example, you might negotiate better deals with suppliers, work carefully on scheduling to reduce downtime, or spend time training your team and researching technology that will improve productivity.
It’s important to be proactive in managing costs and maximising efficiency, so you can maintain your competitiveness while delivering high-quality results.
7. Diversification
Diversifying what you offer can help mitigate the impact of market fluctuations. Also, it brings you into contact with a broader range of customers. Maybe you can expand into related services, such as small repairs and maintenance, landscaping, energy-efficient upgrades, or special projects. Offering energy-efficient upgrades may appeal to environmentally conscious customers seeking to reduce their carbon footprint and lower their utility bills. Growing your list of satisfied customers (from smaller jobs) can also grow your referral base!
8. Customer education
Educating your customers about the long-term benefits of investing in quality renovations and home improvements can help overcome price objections. Emphasise the longer-term value that you can bring, such as increased resale value, improved comfort and livability, and energy savings. Post articles and guides on your website that explain the benefits of different renovation options and the return on investment they offer.
In conclusion, while a changing market does present its challenges, builders can overcome these by adopting a proactive and strategic approach.

TITLE   : Tips you can bank on!

There are two poor accounting methods commonly practiced by builders that banks don’t like (see below). If that sounds like you, follow these tips to help get your banker on side
Adapting to a growing economy is exciting, but exposes you to a new set of risks. An increasing number of jobs bring larger accounts, bigger bills and more financial exposure.
Managing cash flow is key, and more building businesses are looking to banks for assistance so they can make the most of good opportunities. Applying to the bank for funding can be intimidating, but it doesn’t have to be.
There are several things you can do now, to make it easier for when you need bank funding.
For example, many smaller builders I’ve worked with aren’t just focused on one project ­– they’re building for customers, while at the same time doing work for themselves. This may be as simple as the team working on the builder’s own home, helping with a renovation project, improving a rental, or building a spec home. While it’s useful to keep the team busy during a slow patch, operating in this manner can make it difficult to raise operating capital from the bank when you need it – if certain precautions aren’t followed.
Small builders usually operate just one set of accounts and put all purchases, including those for their own projects, through this one set. While this might be okay operationally, these accounts need to be adjusted by the accountant before they can be presented to the bank, because they make the business look like a bad risk!
Bankers use a completely different set of measures when assessing the value of a project.
If you want to make your business easy to present to the bank, then learn how to see things their way. It’s not hard, and it gives you a much better idea of the health of your business at any given time – this has to be good.
Typically there are two things you may be doing that cause the bank to view your business as high risk. Change these actions and not only will you present better to bankers, you will give yourself a much better tool for measuring the performance of your company.
For example, you purchase land on builder’s terms, and build a spec property to be sold on completion. You put all the expenses through the books and allocate the build costs to an expense account in your financial system, as you would with any job.
But there is no income to offset these expenses – at least not until the property is sold – which may be some time in the future and/or in a subsequent financial year. It makes your income look bad, and your profit and loss report will be a useless measure of your business’s operational performance, which is an important consideration for the bank.
While the build is in progress, your cash flow is tight. It will come right when the property is sold, but until then it threatens to undermine the whole business. You wonder if it is worth all the stress and sleepless nights, to say nothing of the risk. You need bridging finance – usually quickly – but that is going to take time.
Consider yourself a regular customer of your business. Invoice yourself at retail value for all the work and materials you use in your project (as you would a regular customer). Then the overall performance of your company (as measured by the gross profit line on the profit and loss report – accrued of course) will be more accurately reflected in your reports. What’s more, if it’s bad, then you know that your company is not performing well and you need to do something immediately rather than wait until it’s too late.
Of course, this does not remove the cash flow problem (because you will not be paying your invoices until the property is sold). However, it does offer a simple picture of the performance of your business, which may improve your chances of attracting funding, should your project be a good one and your performance history acceptable.
It goes with saying that you should have your accountant involved, to make sure that your accounts and tax implications are handled properly.
This isn’t as complicated as it sounds. It’s a common action, especially when you’re adding to, or improving, something you already own and intend to hold onto long term. The problem occurs when you purchase supplies and labour out of your business account, then use them for your investment.
This is because you are allocating things to an expense account that should really be allocated to an assets account. Therefore, the direct expenses in your business accounts appear greater than they should, and the gross profit in your profit and loss report is reduced. This is not good, as it portrays your business as a bad risk for your banker.
Because building businesses operate on slim margins, when your accounts show even slimmer margins, bankers get the jitters.
Review where your investment expenses are being coded and assign them to an assets account. When you do, they ‘disappear’ from the operating part of your profit and loss report and show up on your balance sheet. Your accountant can help you set this up.
Again, this does not add cash to your bank account, but it shows more accurately how your company is performing, and this is what banks review when considering your risk.
There is no question that accounting is complicated. Accountants earn their keep, but there is no reason why your day-to-day accounts shouldn’t work in your favour. By observing business basics and improving your discipline, you can actually create accounts that work in your favour.
Accurate accounts aren’t only good for bank presentation. When used properly, they give you an edge by offering accurate insight into your business’ performance.

Economic slowdowns often hit the construction industry particularly hard – a serious concern for business owners and also something that can seriously affect their teams. In this article, Builder’s Business Coach Graeme Owen shares six ways of looking after staff when times are tough
In uncertain times, maintaining employee wellbeing has to become another priority on a business owner’s to-do list. A team under stress can lead to low morale, decreased productivity and present a risk to on-site safety – all of which comes with financial implications.
Here are six practical strategies business owners can employ to help keep their crews motivated, engaged and resilient during tough economic times.
Communicate honestly and regularly
In times of uncertainty, your team will naturally have concerns about job security and the company’s future. Some will worry more than others. Don’t let rumours spread! Communicate openly about your business’s challenges and how you plan to navigate through them.
Hold regular meetings to update your team on the status of current and future projects. Tell them about workload expectations and don’t be afraid to share any financial realities.
For example, if delays in getting contracts signed are pushing back start dates, explain the situation clearly, so the team understands the root cause rather than speculating.
Open communication is really important because it builds trust and reduces the anxiety that comes from uncertainty. When your team members know your company’s situation and are kept in the loop, they’re less likely to worry unnecessarily – and stay focused on their tasks.
Recognise and appreciate hard work
When money is tight and work is uncertain, it’s not possible to offer wage increases or bonuses. However, showing appreciation doesn’t always need to be financial. You can recognise hard work and team achievements in other meaningful ways.
Maybe it’s a team BBQ at the end of a long week, applauding someone’s performance at a toolbox meeting or simply thanking employees individually for going the extra mile. These small gestures can have a big impact on team morale.
Recognition boosts morale. In times of economic uncertainty, knowing that their efforts are seen and valued can give your team a sense of purpose and encourage them to keep putting in their best work.
Provide support
The construction industry is known for its demanding physical work but it can also take a mental toll, especially during tough times. As a business owner, it’s essential to recognise the emotional strain that both you and your team might be under.
Emotional stress is not always obvious, so look for early signs. For example, a reduction in work output, reduced quality of workmanship, irritability, mood swings, or simply increased absence.
It can be beneficial to encourage a culture in which your team feels comfortable talking about individual stresses and struggles. Have an open-door policy and encourage your team leaders to be sensitive to anyone showing signs of stress. You might also consider bringing in a mental health professional or coach for a workshop on handling stress and accessing available support resources.
Emotional wellbeing is often overlooked in industries like construction but a team that feels supported mentally is more likely to be productive and less prone to mistakes or accidents.
Offer flexibility where possible
While some construction sites involve fairly fixed working hours, offering flexibility where possible can help some of your team members manage their personal lives better. For example, you could offer staggered start and finish times to accommodate family responsibilities or rotate shifts to allow for an occasional extra day off without affecting productivity outcomes.
Flexibility can enable your team to stay productive and focused on their work. Even small adjustments to schedules can show that you value their wellbeing, and will likely be returned with loyalty.
Invest in training and skill development
When work slows down, it can be an opportunity to upskill your team. Think of safety certifications and training in new equipment, technical skills and construction techniques. This helps keep your team engaged and boosts their confidence.
Investing in your team’s development shows your long-term commitment to them. People who are continually learning feel more secure in their jobs and more valued.
Promote work-life balance
One of the biggest challenges in the construction industry is long hours, especially when trying to meet a deadline. While your team may respond to the occasional deadline, overworking them can lead to burnout, accidents and high staff turnover.
So, encourage your crew to take necessary breaks and to use their vacation days when possible. You may even decide, after a particularly demanding job, to reward your team with extra time off or a shorter workday.
It goes without saying that a team that is well-rested and mentally recharged will perform better. So, maintaining a healthy work-life balance can help your team remain resilient in the face of challenges, both on and off-site.
Takeaway
Tough economic times require business owners to be more than just a manager – you need to be a leader who cares about your team’s well-being by focusing on communication, recognition, flexibility, emotional support, training, and work-life balance.
View tough times as an opportunity to build a resilient and motivated workforce that not only gets through but thrives, so that when the economy rebounds, you are in a strong position to take on new challenges.

When times are tough and you’re staring down the barrel, Graeme Owen from The Successful Builder says the worst thing you can be is a possum
Wh en I was growing up, it was not unusual to run over a possum when driving on a country road at night. It would stop, fixed in the headlights, get hit by the car and die on the spot. Breakfast for the hawks!
Its problem wasn’t that it crossed the road, nor that a car was coming. Its problem was that it froze, rigid with fright!
Inquest: inaction killed the possum (all it needed to do was take a couple of leaps).
Inaction can have dire consequences, but actions change things.
Recently, I have spoken to several builders who have faced dramatic setbacks: significant jobs cancelled; cost blowouts; staff resignation and supplier accounts put on hold. Challenges so big that they seemed almost insurmountable. Initially it is paralysing – frightening even!
But it need not be fatal (for your business).
If you find yourself in a situation where your business is severely threatened, it’s tempting to just freeze. It can feel like the end of everything.
But it need not be. You are a builder, and builders are people of action. So, it is possible that applying my Massive Action Strategy (MAS) may be right for you.
Here are the steps I have worked on with several business owners facing overwhelming threats.
1. Identify the threats
The first step is to make a list of all the challenges you are facing. Do it dispassionately and as accurately as possible, but don’t spend too much time worrying about it. If possible, list them in order of priority with the biggest threat at the top.
2. Focus on the few Once you have listed each challenge your company is facing, settle on the top two or three. Estimate the cost that each one of these is likely to have on your company over the next year and combine them. This combined figure is likely to be the worst possible outcome.
After that, take a few moments to tantrum! Then get on with it.
3. Hard stuff
Now to get to the really hard part! Take the first challenge and decide if it can be fixed. If not, move to the second, and the third.
Make notes of any actions you could take to fix (or partly fix) the things that can be fixed. This is challenging work and you may benefit from getting someone outside your company to help you, as they may be able to see things you can’t.
If the main challenges are outside your control, then you need to start thinking creatively about actions you can take to pivot your company: a change of market perhaps; a change of geography; a change of products or services.
If you have not experienced a downturn before, this may just seem too hard. But remember, there was a time when you first saw an opportunity and started your company. There are always opportunities available to those who look. Again, it may help to get some help from someone else here.
But don’t sit around. Come up with possibilities!
Note: If you think that you may need to wind up your company, then talk to your legal and accounting advisors immediately. It is better to do so early than to grow a bad debt.
4. Plan
Once you have some possibilities, choose just one and build a plan to make it happen. Note the outcome you want and list three to five steps that you would need to take.
Do this for a maximum of three.
5. Massive action
This is the key! Once you have your plan together, commit to putting it into action with Massive Action. Do this for no longer than a week at a time and review. Have I made progress ? Is it still a good plan ? If not, quit it and move onto the next plan. Almost everything else can wait a week. Take a short break and then do another few days of Massive Action. Do it as if your life depends on it. If it starts to work, do more of it. Your goal is to find what works for you and do it.
6. Review quickly
The purpose of the Massive Action Strategy is to get results quickly so you can determine if it was a good plan or not. Not every plan will work out. But better to learn that quickly.
Examples
A builder I worked with determined that his biggest challenge was the continual late payment from his biggest repeat commercial customer, putting undue stress on him and on the company’s finances. So, he quit that company and pivoted to residential. His Massive Action strategy was his team spending half a day delivering 3,000 pamphlets in his local area. Within 48 hours he had four jobs and enough work for 2-3 weeks – which kept his crew together while he decided the next steps.
Another builder built a Massive Action 90 Day Plan, comprising three key goals and 10 action steps. At time of writing, he had achieved two of these and a third was well under way.
Takeaway?

While it’s tempting to say yes to every job, it’s worth taking a step back and considering your next move, so you can head in the right direction long-term
Lately, you may find yourself running around like a madman, with the phone ringing and lots of people calling on your time. Money is good, there’s a building boom on and it looks set to continue for some time. So, now is the obvious time to pull out all the stops, take on as much work as possible and just go for it, right?
Wrong! Especially if you are “running like a chicken with its head cut off”.
The thing is, if you are facing challenges delivering the kind of service you believe in, then simply multiplying what you are currently doing is just going to increase the difficulties – and give you much bigger headaches.
So, rather than jump in, you need to use the opportunity the current boom presents to build yourself a long-term and secure building business. That way you will be successful now, during the boom, and long after this boom is over (and it will end – we just don’t know when).
To make the most of the greater demands that the current situation is putting on you, you need to get away from the bind of being incredibly busy.
To build a smart and secure business, you need to put time into it and work on the strategies that need to be implemented to enable it to both survive and grow.
Even more important is getting those strategies in the correct order.
Here are just some of the steps you might want to follow to get your sites running smoothly.
1. Instruction
Never delegate a job unless you have given clear instructions about how you want the job to be run. Never leave a foreman to just do it his way! Sure, he may do it well, but imagine the confusion if in time you have several jobs running concurrently – all following different routines. Project managing will be a nightmare! Team members will not be able to move around easily as they will need to learn new routines for each foreman!
2.Design
Take a little time and design your onsite routine now, while you are small, and while you work on the routine yourself. Imagine that you are both the foreman and the project manager and outline the onsite management routines – meetings, reports etc. It might seem a bit odd having a meeting with yourself (as foreman), and giving a report to yourself (as project manager) but it’s worth it – when you get busy, you want these routines to be running smoothly.
3.Implement
Don’t spend heaps of time trying to get your processes perfect before you start using them. They will never be perfect! Rather, roll out your routines and systems while the business is still small and while you still have no more than two or three jobs running at a time. Work on making your routines habitual and then on improving them.
The goal is to have these routines running at such a level of effectiveness that you can leave your site managers for days on end, knowing that they will be as effective as you would be if you were running that job.
4.What to include
Your systems should include basic things such as site behaviour (culture), health and safety, tidiness, language and radios, etc. Then, of course, job-related systems such as typical job instructions to ensure your foreman approaches each section of work the way you would.
Most importantly, you need checklists to ensure each stage of a job is finished correctly.
Finally, you need some performance tools – for setting targets, allocating work and reporting on achievement of targets.
These systems and processes will ensure that your jobs deliver both what the client wants and meet your standards, your schedule and the budget that you have allowed.
Lastly, you need to monitor the performance of your onsite teams, systems and routines by having a review of all your onsite processes at least twice a year.
Building a strong and stable construction business takes time and logic.

During stressful times, make sure to take care of yourself, plan ahead and look for solutions rather than focus on problems
It has been said that the most important part of any business is the top two inches – that’s of your head. In other words, the most strategic part of your business, which ought to be protected the most, is your brain. Or to be more precise – your thinking.
This is particularly true when the business environment you operate in is uncertain and going through change.
It’s at times like these, when your business needs a clear-headed owner with positive and effective leadership, that you may find yourself having sleepless nights due to agonising over decisions, upset clients and staffing issues.
So, in this article I focus on three things I’ve learned over the years that helped me stay clear-headed when going through change.
1. Take care of yourself
This might sound obvious, but I meet many builders working longer and longer hours in the current climate. They tell me they need to do this just to keep on top of things. When I dig a little deeper, I discover that working harder is their way of coping with pressure.
They aren’t alone. Most builders in the industry are coping with similar pressures, including material supply constraints, scheduling subcontractors and recruiting qualified team members.
However, simply working longer hours to solve these problems is not the answer. When the work environment changes, you need to change. If what you are currently doing is not working well, then simply doing more of it is not really solving the problem. In fact, it may be making it worse, since overworking may be reducing your ability to make good decisions about what needs to be done.
So, pause and take stock.
Itemise each pressure area. Keep the list short – three or four is more than enough. Then decide on one area and focus on finding a solution(s) to that one area.
Give yourself enough time to research, talk to peers who are also experiencing similar pressure and make some new plans. Then trial each new idea until you find a workable solution.
Take care of yourself by pausing.
2. Plan tomorrow today
This is a simple routine that can help you work with greater efficiency. It simply involves taking your ‘to do’ list and selecting a few things you will do tomorrow. But only those things. Leave everything else on the (never ending) ‘to do’ list.
Then plan your day so that you have enough time to actually get these few things done, or resolved. Be careful not to plan every minute. Make sure that you allow some time for interruptions and phone calls, otherwise it won’t work as well.
The trick is to complete your tasks – to succeed – because there is nothing like success to breed success. Just the activity of ticking off completed tasks gives you that satisfied feeling of completing the day, rather than never being able to do enough. It feels like success.
But, the catch is, you must do this before the day ends.
If you have decided on what you need to do tomorrow, and set your plan, then your subconscious mind can use your sleeping time to troll through the recesses of your brain to find memories and ideas that may assist you succeed. Your goals have given your subconscious a plan – you may even find yourself waking up with a great idea!
But, when you don’t plan the next day before you go to sleep, your subconscious mind lacks clear direction and tends to worry – all night long in some cases – and usually about all the things that could go wrong! Know the feeling?
So, plan tomorrow today. Start making a short list of things you know you can accomplish tomorrow – so that you succeed. Then tick them off as they are completed.
You can slowly add a little more each day until you reach your level, but always write your list before you finish the day.
Should you have one of those days (again), where everything turns to custard, then at the end of the day, put a line through each uncompleted task and reschedule it to another day. Or if you can, just delete it. Maybe it doesn’t need to be done. This way you have completed all of your tasks and you can feel you have had a very successful day. That feels good.
Remember, success breeds success.
3. Stay in control
People gravitate towards those who ’have it together’ – who handle themselves well when others may be losing it. No one likes to work for, deal with, or buy from a person losing control. It feels unsafe. So, stay in control.
Now, staying in control is more about governing yourself than others. It’s about being careful what you say and how you say it. It’s about looking for solutions rather than blowing up at problems. The thing is, you can have full control over yourself, whereas you can’t have the same control over others or over the current environment. That can be a revelation for some!
When things happen that elicit an emotive response (for example a mistake is made), pause and look for what you could have done to prevent it happening, for instance, could you have explained the job better? If so, then add that explanation to your systems so that you don’t have this happen again.
Take control of the future by learning from the present and changing your routines or habits. This is the way to stay in control.
Remember, when you take care of the top two inches, you are giving your business the best of you.

When it comes to business, it’s always good to think outside of the box – especially when it’s based on the experiences of one who has been successful with a particular strategy. That’s why we’re featuring a successful painting company as a case study, because looking at an example from outside your industry can help you think outside the box.
T his year, Auckland-based Paint & Plasterboard Finishing Ltd was named Master Painter of the Year, Overall Residential Master Painter of the Year Award 2016 and won the Residential Exterior Character Large Award.
Arjen Bloem
Arjen Bloem
I asked owner Arjen Bloem what he had learned in creating such a successful  painting business.
Here’s what he said:
To win awards you need to have a healthy business
You need to be the familiar with the financial details of your business and you need to work with them. If you aren’t good with the numbers, it’s unlikely you will build a financially strong business.
It’s no good hiding behind the excuse that your accountant is taking care of it  all.
You need to become selective
Carefully choose what areas you want to specialise in and for whom you will work, then stick to it. In other words, find your niche.
The most successful companies know who they are and what they do best.
Many small business owners think that they have to be everything to everyone in order to get ahead.
It’s better to choose the jobs you are good at, identify the type of clients you want to work with and specialise from there. It took a while for me to identify the niche I wanted to occupy: large character repaints in Remuera, St Heliers and Herne Bay.
People call us all the time with different work and in other areas. However, we know that these jobs will be more difficult (for us) with less predictable results and therefore reduced client satisfaction and profit.
Being selective means you are paid to do the job really well, and it also helps create a strong reputation.
Create an effective sales process
Having a working, consistent sales process means that you can keep adding new clients to your business without wasting time preparing quotes for jobs you will never get.
Our entire marketing and sales process is designed for our particular market – and only that market. We have learned (by trial and error) how to reach them with our message. Also, we have fine-tuned our system so that we make around 20 appointments every week.
Each appointment is in the exact geographic area and with a prospective client that has been well qualified. We already know that they are likely to need our particular service.
Our process also qualifies out those potential clients who may not value the product mix we offer, so we don’t end up wasting time (ours and theirs) by pricing their work. When you control the nature of your workflow, you get consistent results.
Create systems
To ensure that your team doesn’t repeat the same mistakes you made while learning the best way to do things, you need to create systems for your people to follow. It can be as simple as bullet point instructions on how you want things done.
Start simple and ask your staff to follow these systems. With reliable systems, you can guarantee that what you promise will actually be delivered.
Develop personal resilience
Building a company is a long game and you have to make tough decisions. Some will turn out to be wrong, even though you thought long and hard about them. Often things go wrong for no apparent reason. You need to suck up the pain and learn from it. Use setbacks to develop better thinking, better people and stronger systems.
Employ the right people
To do a good job, you need the right people. Sure they cost money, but if you focus on only selling and doing work that earns you money, then you can afford to pay the higher wages that quality staff command.
Good people want the business to succeed. They will do what it takes, so focus on getting people who fit your company. Don’t be pushed to lower your standards because the labour market might be tight. Persevere!
Get the best coach/mentor you can find!
I did, right from the very start of my business. I wanted the best possible assistance I could get, so I checked around and made sure that I was getting business coaching and not more business information.
I wanted someone who would not only support me, but who would tell me the stuff I needed to hear: someone who would be committed to helping me become a successful business owner.

Top Garden director Louis Wu cautions subbies to do their research before carrying out work after a developer he worked for went bust
The landscaper worked for Triple Connection, which went into insolvency owing Wu more than $100,000.
Top Garden was contracted to provide landscaping services at Jade Lake, a housing and visitor accommodation project in Queenstown. Despite two Building Disputes Tribunal decisions and two High Court orders, Triple Connection failed to pay Top Garden and building firm Concept Builders what they were owed.
“In Queenstown, after we left, they still spent like a year doing their projects. They must have been paying something to the subbies to keep the project going,” Wu said.
“You can’t trust anyone now.”
As Top Garden and Concept Builders were classed as unsecured creditors, they are unlikely to recover even their legal costs as Triple Connection is now in liquidation. As a result, Wu said Top Garden will stop work on a project right away if there’s even one missed progress payment.
Due diligence is vital
The case highlights the importance of subcontractors doing due diligence before taking on work. Obtaining credit reports can highlight potential issues such as payment defaults, which can give tradies an idea of payment performance.
Builtin’s Construction Risk Expert Ben Rickard said there are some products on the market, such as CheckMate by CreditWorks, which allows subbies to pay a small fee for a one-off credit check to be carried out.
“Both consumers and businesses can also be checked via credit agencies like Centrix, Equifax or Illion,” he added.
A credit check would likely highlight potential red flags, which subbies could investigate further before deciding whether to continue with the work or not.
Additionally, the update of the Construction Contracts Act 2002 means that well-written construction documentation can stop developers from refusing to pay the whole invoice because it is disputing part of it.
For example, $20,000 from a $150,000 invoice could be under dispute, but the developer would still have to pay $130,000.
Terms of trade should also be reviewed to include clauses such as the ability to add legal and collection costs to a job. Larger deposits can also be a way to make sure materials, at least, are covered before a job commences. Another option subbies can use to protect themselves is trade credit insurance.
Survival tools
Commenting on Top Garden’s situation on LinkedIn, Kirsty Merriman – a property developer and consultant who describes herself as an ‘advocate for fair practices in development’ – said: “It’s tough to see good contractors who do quality work end up in these situations saying that he can’t trust anyone now.
“The reality is harsh but true – in today’s climate tight contracts, clear payment terms, and proper due diligence aren’t just good business practice… they’re survival tools.”
Rickard agreed with Merriman on the subject of contracts, and said they were an essential tool for builders conducting any sized job.
“Legally, only contracts over $30,000 must have a written contract. However, to provide the best protection in the event of a dispute, you must have a contract. If the customer won’t sign a contract that should be a huge red flag!
“Make this a ‘must do’ before buying any materials or proceeding with any work on site.”
Rickard has also authored a separate article for Under Construction , where he goes into more detail about how subbies can protect themselves from non-payers. Click here to read it in full.

As a builder, you’ve likely learnt how to hit a nail on the head every time – but have you considered how to have the same success when it comes to attracting hits to your website?
J ust as a handshake can no longer replace a contract, word of mouth can no longer replace a website. This is because, even if your customer recommends you to a mate, chances are their next move will be to check you out online.
However, simply having a website is no longer enough. Just like any advertisement, it has to be seen by the right people to be effective. You might see roadside billboards when you’re driving, but your passengers may not. You might watch commercials during free-to-air television, but other consumers might use their personal device during commercial breaks instead.
The point is, while billboards and TV ads still work, the number of people who see them has gone down due to a change in consumer behaviour.
These days, most people who need a specific product or service will go online to find businesses that provide what they’re looking for, so they can compare several suppliers before contacting one.
What does that mean for me?
It means two things:
The importance of making a good impression online is paramount.
Perhaps more importantly, ensure that your business shows up on the results list when people are searching for builders.
To make this happen – without breaking the bank by boosting your site – you need to understand how searching online works and apply it to your strategy.
1. Start with your customers
Before you do any online marketing of your website, you need to truly understand your customer, because your business can’t exist without them.
Getting to know them thoroughly is one of the most important prerequisites to securing new business online. As you understand their concerns and the questions they are asking, you can customise your website to connect with their searches.
Start with your customers by building a list of what they say they want and what they say they need. List their top priorities, concerns and the key questions they are asking when choosing a building company.
Then each time you get an enquiry, ask how they found out about you. If it was online, you can ask what words they typed into the search box. You will learn heaps from this simple routine and it will help you shape your website.
2. Add content to your website
Assuming you have a website, one of the greatest strategies for increasing exposure is adding compelling content to your website. This can be done through blog posts, articles, videos or infographics. Your goal is to inform and educate your readers and viewers, which in turn helps make them more aware of your company.
When searching, Google reads zillions of website pages and creates indexes of the ones that are relevant to a search enquiry – the more pages you have on your website, the more chances you have of being found.
But quantity is not everything, as Google’s search engine also ranks pages according to the quality of the information on the page. Therefore, the better the information, the higher the ranking and the greater chance you have of being found.
What’s more, achieving higher rankings positions you as an expert in your field. This results in greater trust and respect and shows your potential customer that you know what you’re talking about.
3. Write compelling content
So, what should you write about for your website to get better rankings from search engines ? What is ‘compelling content’ ?
The answer is simple: whatever answers the questions your ideal customer is asking.
So, depending on your particular service and on your ideal customer, you might write articles answering questions such as:
How long does it take to build a custom home ?
What is your company working on at the moment ?
What should I look out for when choosing a builder ?
Where do I find an experienced renovation builder in Tauranga ?
What is the extra cost of building a two-storey house ?
How much will a new home cost ?
For example, if you create a well-written blog about ‘The things to know when renovating your home’ it may rank highly in the search engine indexes.
Then, if a prospective customer searching ‘renovating my home’ lands on your page and likes the answer you give, it may prompt them to explore your site further and eventually could lead to them choosing you to renovate their home.
So, start making a list of questions your ideal customer is asking (or might ask) and build a list of interesting answers that can become your blog topics.
You can do some research on the internet to see what others are blogging about. Then try to write a blog regularly. Start with just one a month – or one every two months – but make it routine. Keep it simple and include images or videos to keep it interesting.
What if I’m no good at writing?
Don’t panic. Just take one of the important questions from your list and note three to four key points that answer this question, or guide your reader to find the answer. For example, let’s consider our example blog ‘The things to know when renovating your home’ – your key points might be:
Is it worth doing ?
Talk to your bank.
Designers can’t estimate costs like builders.
There will always be hidden costs.
Then enlist the help of a professional writer to help you write. But remember, while they may help you shape your content, you need to stay in touch with your market by becoming the expert on the questions your ideal customer is asking.
Taking the time to create great content for your website may not yield an immediate return, but it will ensure your website starts to show up more and more in searches.

TITLE   : Build a team of super subs!

So you want a fantastic team of subcontractors to help you create a great working environment, ensuring quality workmanship, punctuality, maintaining a schedule, and flexibility when faced with unexpected delays. That would be a dream come true. Is it possible?
It could be. Engaging great subcontractors results from a combination of skills that you can develop yourself. These skills are:
1. Building relationships
The best teams of subcontractors I know like working with builders who treat them as colleagues, who see them as working together to achieve a common goal. They share a common culture and respond to circumstances in a similar way. They know that the builder has their back and is not out to fleece them of their last dollar.
In the same way, they understand the need to keep to their word, deliver high-quality workmanship and stand behind their work.
It’s a relationship that benefits the builder, the subcontractor and, ultimately, the client.
When you think of your subbies as part of your team (your work family), you are more likely to treat them with the respect they deserve and they are more likely to respond in a like manner.
This fosters a collaborative environment in which you all work together harmoniously. Furthermore, it encourages sharing of expertise and problem-solving that serves to broaden your knowledge and skillset. This has to be good!
2. Pre-qualification
It’s way better to avoid a subcontractor who is likely to deliver poor workmanship than to pay the price for substandard work. This invariably leads to heated arguments, controversy, legal problems and, worst of all, dissatisfied customers.
However, you can avoid such disappointment by carefully qualifying before selection.
Check on your prospective subcontractor’s reputation and experience. Ask for references and/or examples of their work and run some checks before engaging them. After all, you do this when employing new staff (over whom you have supervisory influence), so you ought to do the same when selecting subcontractors (over whom you have much less supervisory influence).
It is also good to check (and list) their range of abilities and assess whether or not these match your requirements. They may be really good at some areas of their trade, but that doesn’t mean they will be good in all areas. For example, someone who is capable on a commercial build site may not have the skill necessary for an upmarket residential job.
3. Onboarding and orientation
Once you have chosen a new subcontractor, do the following before you engage them.
Introduce them to the members of your team with whom they will be working.
Orientate them with your company culture, safety policies and any site-specific rules you have in place.
Explain your quality management processes, payment systems and  how you expect any disputes should be handled.
It is always better to cover off as many things as possible before you engage a subcontractor and before any potential issues arise.
4. Clearing the paperwork
When asking subcontractors for quotations, always ensure that you provide an adequate outline of the scope of works you are requesting to avoid any misunderstanding. Include any quality standards that may be applicable, your projected timelines, and your payment terms.
When engaging your subcontractor, do so with a clearly written contract or agreement. If necessary, ask your lawyer to assist you with creating a template. It really clears the air and ensures that both you and your subcontractor are on the same page.
Don’t assume that, because they are good people, you will not run into any problems along the way. It happens! Things sometimes go wrong and mistakes occur.
Should a disagreement arise, don’t let it become personal. Refer to your written instructions and specifications and ‘work the contract’! This is what it is for and when a well-written one is worth its weight in gold.
5. Maintaining communication
Perhaps most important of all is to establish regular and open communication with your subcontractors to discuss progress, changes and any challenges they may be coming up against. Encourage them to raise concerns or to ask questions promptly, so that you can do whatever is needed to ensure a smooth workflow.
Check in regularly on their performance and request that they submit a copy of the quality assurance check that you require on completion.
Depending on the length of the job, it may be good to schedule a regular time to connect with your subcontractors, even if everything is going smoothly – just to stay in touch. It’s little things like these that build the foundations for good communication when things go wrong.
Further, when a subcontractor has done a great job, make sure that you show your appreciation.
Takeaway
By building strong relationships with a carefully selected and oriented crew of subcontractors, you are well on the way to surrounding yourself with a high-performing team and to achieving great customer outcomes. Who wouldn’t want that ?

Many business owners often wish for good business advice, but knowing where to go can be difficult. Here are some questions to consider
I f your business has grown rapidly, become stagnant or evolved in another way, bringing someone with the appropriate experience on board to help can be a wise investment. While you can always ask other builders, there may be times when you think professional insight necessary.
But is expensive professional advice worth the cost ?
That’s a good question and of course you would expect me to say yes. After all, it’s business coaching fees that pay my salary. However, professional advice need not be expensive and is often worth the investment.
There are many options to choose from and each one has its particular value. Here are some to consider:
Take an Institute of Directors’ Course
If you own a company where managers oversee much of the day-to-day running, you may want to develop your directing and governing abilities so you can lead with confidence.
Institute of Directors’ (IoD) courses cover many relevant topics. They are quite in-depth and intensive, but generally of short duration, so are not a major interruption to your weekly schedule.
They are also very relevant if you are a member of a committee or on the board of a trade or training association.
Further, if you run (or have run) a successful building business and think you have what it takes to help others succeed, serving as an independent director can open up a whole new career path. In this case, IoD courses will really help set you up for success.
Cost: $1,000 or more.
Add an advisory board member
In some situations, you may feel that new skills, experience and/or business insight are required. Maybe you have developed a product that you would like to market nationwide, or want to get into significant property development.
A challenge could be that you have no experience in marketing a manufactured product and organising a distribution network, or in financing developments.
So you want someone who has this particular experience and who can advise you on the steps to take. You don’t necessarily want them to own a share of the business, just give their advice for a time.
This is an advisory board member – someone who can help you make plans and execute them in areas in which you have little or no experience.
In it’s early stages, an advisory board may be just one or two professionals who meet with you once a month. As the business grows, you can add further expertise by adding new advisory board members.
Cost: Approximately $15,000 or more per year.
Talk with your accountant
Perhaps the most overlooked professional advisor for small businesses is your accountant. They might speak another language and seem to be focused on annual accounts and tax issues, but their job means they get to review the performance of hundreds of companies.
In reality they know heaps but, due to professional liability, some accountants hesitate to give advice.
This is understandable, particularly given that many business owners don’t meet with them beyond the once a year when they do their tax returns. If you don’t have a strong relationship with your accountant, they may not really know your business or how you behave in a given situation, so you can’t really expect them to give specific advice.
Organising a bi-monthly meeting with your accountant could be the first step to drawing on their assistance. Don’t be afraid to ask them to explain your financials in terms that you can understand, because such knowledge is invaluable in preventing financial blowouts.
Cost: Approximately $3,000-4,000 per year.
Enrol in a university course
If you are motivated to learn through study, then a university course could be a great way to develop your potential – from undergraduate business courses to postgraduate programmes. Many are available part-time.
A good way to test if this will work for you is to enrol in a short course at a local university. Most universities offer these and they don’t cost much.
You might want to check out an MBA (Master of Business Administration) programme. They are often part-time and spread over several years, and are designed to help you learn by using your own business as the test case. You get to apply what you learn in your business immediately!
Cost: Student fees vary, shop around.
Hire a franchise consultant
If you have an established business with a good niche that could be successful in other areas, you might want to consider franchising. A franchise coach will assist you to organise and systematise your business, and prepare all the documentation to market your system to franchisees in other localities. Franchising can grow your brand rapidly.
Cost: Approximately $20,000 or more.
Engage a business coach
Business coaches differ from other consultants in that they bring both business and life experience into your work. While helping you improve your business, they will teach you the business skills they are utilising and help you develop your own skills.
Often your business coach will become someone you can confide in and be accountable to and, should they care enough about you to confront you when necessary, a robust and long-term relationship may ensue.
They may be especially helpful when you are facing significant change, such as when starting out in business or transitioning to a new level. Often their fees will be tied to the performance of the business.

If you’re thinking about employing migrant workers, a little planning can go a long way. Preparing foreigners for life and work in New Zealand will help them adapt quicker, which can only mean good news for your business.
Migrant workers can help fill labour and skill shortages in the construction sector – but how well they do that can depend on how quickly and successfully they adapt to Kiwi culture, both inside and outside the workplace. Employers can help by preparing prospective overseas employees for life in New Zealand; in doing so, you can help maximise their productivity within your business.
Immigration New Zealand provides some simple tips that can make all the difference to settling and retaining migrant workers in its helpful guide Are You Employing Migrant Construction Workers?
Over the next few issues of Under Construction, we’ll continue to feature content from this guide; so that when you encounter issues, you’ll have a better idea of how to deal with them.
It’s a good idea to employ migrant workers before your workload peaks. Once hired, prepare some information that will help them fit into the workplace and the culture more quickly.
You could:
Meet your workers when they arrive in town and give them a tour of the area.
Give them a welcome kit that includes local community information and important contact details, including your own and that of the nearest Settlement Support office (there are 18 around the country).
Advise them where to buy food, clothes and other basic needs, and the location of schools and medical centres.
Help them or give them some time to make personal arrangements, such as opening a bank account, organising an IRD number and getting a mobile phone.
Check they have a valid driver licence for their own country and help them get some transport. Visitors with a valid overseas driver licence can drive in this country for a maximum of 12 months, after which they will need to apply for an NZ licence. The New Zealand Transport Agency has more information and a useful guide, ‘What is different about driving in New Zealand’, available online.
Put on a social event to welcome your new worker (and their family) to the team and to the neighbourhood.
Let them know about any social activities, religious groups or clubs they can join.
Make sure they get to have a chance to experience New Zealand and its culture.
“Employers can help by preparing prospective overseas employees for life in New Zealand; in doing so, you can help maximise their productivity within your business
Some companies have developed a Welcome Kit for new workers, which they give to them before leaving their home country. A Welcome Kit should contain information on:
The travel and arrival process.
Expectations on the job, such as timeliness, honesty and openness.
An overview of New Zealand, including arts, sports, and Māoritanga.
Advice on the New Zealand climate and clothing requirements.
New Zealand language and culture (including New Zealand management and communication culture, plus construction industry jargon and slang).
What to do in an emergency.
Local community health services.
Driving in New Zealand (road rules and driver licensing).
Food and commodity prices.
The local area.
Accommodation advice.
Sending and receiving mail.
Who to contact for advice and support.
A tailored orientation for migrants can be helpful because it:
Sets out your expectations.
Means fewer mistakes are made.
Helps your new employee become familiar with your workplace and work practices.
Most orientation programmes include information about:
Workers’ roles and responsibilities.
Your expectations about employees’ work.
Workers’ employment rights and obligations.
Health, safety and hazards.
Language and cultural differences.
NOTE: Remember, much of this preparation will only need to be done once and can be used for any subsequent overseas employees.
It makes a difference if you:
are patient and can appreciate other ways of doing things
have realistic expectations
give the migrant time to take in new information
assist them with basics, such as tax, phones and banking
are open-minded and interested in other cultures
consider whether your workers need to know more about other cultures
can put yourself in the migrant’s shoes
have a sense of humour

TITLE   : Be seen online!

In last month’s article on online marketing, we focused on putting good-quality content on your website – the next step is to boost the chances that people will actually see it
T here’s a saying that 80% of success in life is about showing up, so it’s hard to catch opportunities when you’re not there. It’s the same with websites – the ones that show up in searches for builders are the only ones that potential customers are likely to see. Simple!
Online marketing can show up at any time – 24 hours a day, seven days a week. It can show up to someone searching for a great builder and it can show up from friends posting about their new home renovation on social media.
The following four steps will help ensure your website is seen:
Scrutinise
Optimise
Socialise
Capitalise
1.Scrutinise
Do your research first by asking yourself the following questions:
What are my current online marketing strategies? List all the things you’re currently doing online, such as Facebook, Linkedin, Pinterest.
How is it going? Examine results on each channel carefully and objectively, noting the differences in how your business is portrayed on each (what words and photos you use to describe your business, what comments people make).
Where is the marketing winning or losing? Are you getting many visits with few conversions, or are you just not getting visits online ?
What are your company goals for online marketing? To get phone calls and email enquiries, or get sign-ups to your interesting blog articles ?
How do you differentiate yourself from other building companies? Asking these questions will help you figure out the types of online marketing channels you should be using to direct people to your website.
It will also guide you in generating keywords and phrases to help your website show up in searches.
2. Optimise
Once you’ve figured out who you want to market to and through which channels, it’s time to optimise your website to rank highly in search results. This is called Search Engine Optimisation (SEO).
Search engines are complex mathematical logarithms that ‘patrol’ the internet, reading websites and organising indexes of thousands of words and phrases, the websites they are hosted on and the popularity (value) of that website. These indexes enable almost instant search results.
The closer your content gets to matching the words, phrases, sentences or questions that are typed into a search engine, the higher your website will rank in the Google index the search returns (assuming everything else is equal).
As an example, let’s say you’ve done your research and you have a list of keywords and phrases that your target customers are likely to use.
You want your home building business to rank highly for the search: “custom home builder in Hamilton”. So, you could follow these three steps:
Include the phrase in the titles of pages on your website.
Put the phrase in the content on your home page.
Write blogs and content about custom home builds you’ve worked on in Hamilton.
It’s highly likely that Google will list your website in an index built from combinations of the words ‘custom’, ‘home’, ‘builder’ and ‘Hamilton’. When someone types in these words, your website will show up.
Mobile friendly There’s nothing worse than scrolling across a page when searching for something on your phone. Research has shown that over 50% of people leave a site if it’s not mobile optimised.
This is called the ‘bounce rate’ – the percentage of visitors who go to your website and leave without exploring another page – and it’s bad because Google rates it negatively.
The higher the bounce rate, the lower your ranking – even if it’s only because your site isn’t mobile friendly!
3. Socialise
Social media is a great way to communicate with potential leads.
Platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest and Google+ allow you to easily reach new audiences and be seen. It’s easy and quick to share photos of new homes or interesting renovation projects.
You can promote selected website posts and even target your ads at a specific audience, such as people in particular locations or with a certain set of interests.
Some builders also find Facebook a great place to interact with customers and answer questions. In valuing your website, Google also looks at your business’ overall social presence. Social interactions help you rank higher in Google searches.
Each time you add a new blog post to your website, add the link to each of your social profiles to drive more traffic to your website. If readers like what they see, they’re likely to visit and spend time navigating around your site.
Remember to keep your social media pages up to date – having unanswered questions on a social media page can be as bad as/or worse than not having one at all.
Add updates as often as daily. These could be photos of sites you’re working on. Do this even if you don’t yet have many followers, because Google will take it into account.
4. Capitalise
To drive more traffic to your site and turn more visitors into leads, you can also use pay-per-click advertising (eg, Google Adwords). This is more costly than SEO but, if used correctly, can be a powerful tool.
Google Adwords is great for targeting people who are actively searching for a builder to build or renovate their home, because you’re able to create and run ads for your business that are displayed in Google’s search results.
You stipulate the key searchable words or phrases that will cause your ad to be displayed and you only pay when someone clicks on your ad.
So, don’t make the mistake of being invisible on the internet.
Employing the strategies outlined above will help you show up when potential customers are looking, ensuring your website is in the right place at the right time.

TITLE   : Six ways to save your clients money

With the discussion about cost savings in residential building gaining momentum, there is pressure on builders to deliver even better value
Rapidly rising house prices and first-home buyers struggling to enter the market are fueling the conversation around housing affordability. Here are six things you may be able to do in your business to trim the cost of a build. While each may only contribute a little, together they can add up to significant savings that can be passed onto clients, or used to improve your viability.
For over a century, the Pareto principle also known as the 80/20 rule, from Italian economist Vilfredo Pareto’s observation that 80% of the land was owned by 20% of the population has been applied to almost every area of life. In construction, it suggests that 80% of one building project will be the same as another, and just 20% will be unique.
If we were to observe you on two building projects, we would see you use the same routines for 80% of the work. Why not document these routines to make it easier for newbies to get up to speed ? Your team could follow these standard procedures until someone finds an enhancement, which can then be incorporated to benefit all future jobs.
What is even more powerful is that you can hire less skilled builders. Your procedures train them to do it your way – ideally meaning you won’t need to supervise as closely.
Record how often you and your staff are attending meetings, then ask: “what needs to happen to increase the time between meetings ? ”
It’s easy for project managers to believe they are doing important work, simply because they are attending meetings. However, do you/they need as many ? Does your foreman need a daily visit ?
I’ve seen builders save eight to ten hours a week by simply creating a weekly project management calendar, then gradually increasing the time between meetings. Start with missing a day, then two. Aim for a weekly visit. Of course, there will be exceptions, but it works around 80% of the time.
The first time I counted the number of subbies and suppliers in one residential building project, there were more than 40. I couldn’t believe it! Not many industries deal with such a large supply chain, so it can be a huge burden for builders. How many are involved in your current project ?
To minimise the pressure and reduce delays, make sure that you (or your project manager) work through your next project well in advance. Plan the workflow schedule in detail and highlight the critical items. Tally the man-hours budgeted for each section, and create a simple table for your foreman to keep a running total against budget. You can then act immediately if it looks like time is blowing out.
Good software tools can make a huge difference to construction management by reducing supervisory visits, replacing paperwork, keeping track of communications, informing subbies and suppliers of amendments to schedules, tracking variations and providing a secure place for recording meetings.
If you have more than one build on at any one time, investigate using such a tool. These take time to master, so don’t give up too soon.
Workflow is interrupted and time is lost when subcontractors are delayed. Don’t let it happen in your business! Delays can be prevented by keeping subcontractors informed of your schedule.
Book them well in advance, and request that they confirm their availability. Warn them as soon as you know there is going to be a change, and ask them to do the same.
If you know early on that they cannot keep to the original schedule, you can intervene to protect your workflow. Construction management is all about communication – make it a priority!
Like subcontractor delays, supplier hold-ups can greatly increase the cost of a build. If the joinery is delayed for several weeks because the importer’s fittings are locked up in shipping, then lining can’t start and your team has to secure the site (at additional cost) before heading to another job, blowing out the budget for scaffold hire.

In the world of small building businesses, market retractions can be daunting. However, they actually present an opportunity for growth, resilience, and long-term success, says business coach Graeme Owen
W hile the path out of a downturn may seem uncertain, here are some strategies to not just weather the storm but to emerge stronger.
1. Look to diversify
While defining your target market carefully and focusing on it exclusively is a proven path to long-term success, it does not guarantee success in changing times, nor when there is uncertainty in the marketplace.
So, look around and explore new avenues within your area of skills and within your locality. It may be that you will want to diversify into some different areas. Maybe there were job offerings that you focused on in the past that you could resurrect to get you through slower times.
For example, if you have been focused on new builds, you might explore moving into renovations – provided you have the necessary skills. Or maybe there is a growing demand in your area for eco-friendly buildings. Would it take much to add this to your offering? Perhaps you could look to offer maintenance and repairs. It has been hard for homeowners to get hold of a builder in recent years. Now might be a good time to capitalise on their desire to get long-awaited maintenance done.
By diversifying, you expand your client base and revenue streams. Remember, every client, however small, is an opportunity to get a referral.
2. Focus on your value proposition
In a retracting market, clients are still looking for the best value. This translates into the most they can receive for the best price. Remember, it’s always about price, so make sure that yours includes valuable extras. Don’t just say that you deliver quality. Rather, detail what you give and how it adds value for your potential client.
Set aside a little time and list the unique aspects of your service. These may include quality craftsmanship (because of your quality control process), attention to detail (because of your highly skilled team), your innovative solutions (from your close connections to designers) or your additional guarantees (above and beyond industry standard warranties).
Then build into your sales process ways to showcase how these add tangible value to your clients’ projects. Doing this will set you apart from competitors.
3. Cultivate customer relationships
Building trust and developing strong client relationships is a game-changer when your potential client has a choice of builders. People will not purchase from someone they do not trust. You can build trust by giving exceptional customer service from the very first contact.
Keep your word about any promises you might make about getting back to them. Ensure your communications are clear and don’t be afraid of being transparent throughout the whole pre-build and build process. Becoming a trusted building professional ensures your clients will want to purchase from you – and that they will refer you to friends.
4. Embrace technology and efficiency
Look for technological advancements to improve your productivity and efficiency. Investigate tools like project management software, Building Information Modeling (BIM), and energy-efficient building solutions to streamline your processes and add value to your service. It may mean that you have to engage in a learning process!
5. Financial planning and cost management
During market retractions, careful financial management is crucial. So, keep a close eye on your costs, negotiate with suppliers where possible, and utilise every tool you have to maximise the productivity of your team, while ensuring that your projected budgets do not compromise on quality.
6. Leverage networks
Get in front of other businesses in related industries such as architects, suppliers and interior designers. Go and meet them and ask about their business and how you can help. Don’t simply go cap in hand asking if they have any work for you, as they are likely facing the same issues as you. Use these meetings as an opportunity to expand your reach, generate friendships and lead to mutual referrals.
7. Marketing
Enhance your online presence and your marketing efforts. Look for the cheapest methods first and test them before increasing your spend. Review your website and share success stories to showcase your expertise. A strong brand and consistent marketing efforts will keep you in front of potential clients even in a retracting market.
8. Maintain a positive mindset!
Challenges are part of the journey of business ownership. Every setback can be an opportunity to learn and grow. So, stay resilient, adaptable, and open to innovation. Remember that with determination and good planning, your business can continue to flourish – even in challenging times!

Facing big changes in your market might tempt you to make sudden changes to how you do business. But any changes should be based on sound thinking and reliable information, as business coach Graeme Owen explains
Whatever your opinion of the Government’s handling of Covid-19, you likely felt most comfortable with those actions that you believed were based on the best available evidence – even if you didn’t always agree with the plans made
But you would have reacted quite differently if, instead, those decisions had simply been made on the run with no input from specialists and no evaluation of evidence – simply decided on the whim of an official! You would have been most alarmed. No responsible government would do that.
Yet, at the moment and during these changing times, are you making your business plans based on excellent information? Or are you making your decisions on the run, based on your intuition, press opinions and rumours?
Recently, we have been hearing much about the importance of businesses being nimble and pivoting (new terms for some of us). Simply put, these terms mean that to cope well with the rapidly changing Covid-19 environment you need to make modifications to your products and service offerings quickly – and strategically to suit the changing market demands.
Think of those companies that immediately switched to making masks, or who adapted their business to service the now huge courier demands. I suspect these were strategic decisions based on the best available information about what opportunities the Covid-19 environment would likely bring.
So what good information does your business need to ensure you can pivot safely and nimbly?
1 Market Needs
You can learn about the changing needs of your market by listening carefully to the requests you get for products and services. This may seem obvious, but few business owners do this intentionally.
For example, let’s say you knew that prior to Covid-19, you didn’t get many requests for bathroom renovations. But now you are getting many. If this were the case would you want to make any changes to your business model? Maybe. But first you would want to know if that trend is really increasing or simply a temporary blip.
If you had been recording that information for the last year, you would be able to determine the trend more accurately and make any decisions with a measure of confidence. Further, should the trend reverse (and you would identify that early) you could make further adjustments. Of course, it doesn’t remove the risk entirely, but it does reduce the higher risks of ad-hoc decision making.
So if you are not already recording client needs, start by creating a short list of likely job requests and record each caller in one of these categories. Do monthly summaries and compare month to month and quarter to quarter. In just a few months you will start seeing trends in client needs and be better able to pivot to meet these.
2 Sources of Business
Covid-19 has changed the way we interact socially and the types of media we engage with. How many people now know about Zoom who didn’t know about it pre-Covid-19?
Just so, it makes sense to know if the place from where you have been getting your business leads has changed! Because then you can pivot your advertising. You can choose to quit the advertising that is not working and try new strategies or new places.
However, if you don’t know where your leads are coming from, then you may be missing opportunities or, worse, wasting time and money “speaking to people who have left the room!”
If you are not tracking the source of your new leads, start recording these immediately. Then as early as possible in your conversation ask your new lead, “By the way, how did you find out about us?” and record what they tell you. This information will help you identify clearly those advertising channels that are working and those that are not. You may be surprised. This both saves you money and ensures a steady number of leads into your business.
Now, please don’t simply record,“word of mouth” as it provides very little usable information. While it might sound good, it just raises a whole lot of further questions. E.g. Whose mouth? (Who told them? Family? Colleague? Professional?); What words? (What message did they convey?); Where were they spoken? (Social setting? Work? Professional office? Networking event? etc); When did they hear? (Before, during or after the build?)
But when you do know how your new leads are finding you, you can determine where to re-focus your advertising. Being nimble in advertising is the best way to ensure a steady flow of future work.
3  Changing Profit Centres
There are many other areas where you may want to tweak your business because of changes in the marketplace. E.g. Changes in the availability of new team members; in the availability of subcontractors; in the costs of materials; in delivery times, etc. All of these will have an impact on your business profits and should be factored into your business plans. You may need to adjust your schedules, pricing and/or charge out formulae to off-set these changes.
But these changes are best made based on up-to-date business information from your dashboard.
If you do not run a business dashboard, now is the time to start one.
Keep it simple to begin with. Start with back-costing each and every job: subtract the total costs from the total charged and compare with other similar jobs and with what you quoted or estimated. If you are not generating the gross profits you were, then you want to know as soon as possible so you can take action.
You can also compare current and past schedules. Are your jobs taking longer because of Covid-19 requirements or delays?
Also keep an eye out for materials and subcontractor price and schedule changes as these may likely cause cost increases in the future?
Once you have mastered simple back costing, you can add further complexity. Start measuring the effectiveness of various team makeups. You may find that different team mixes are better than others.
Takeaway
Being nimble and quick is not simply guess work- it’s measured actions based on available information

Accurately quoting a fixed price for labour is one of the trickiest parts of pricing a job. This month, the Successful Builder gives some tips on how to get this part of your quote right
Many builders find the task of producing accurate quotes frustrating. Under-estimating can cost a lot of money and overestimating may price you out of the market. But accurate quoting doesn’t need to be difficult – it is primarily about making use of your past experiences.
When jobs run at a loss, it is not normally because the quantities were wrong but usually because the job took longer than expected – a slow builder doesn’t use more materials than a fast builder.
As a result, it’s important to ensure that your labour estimates are as accurate as possible if you are going to succeed at fixed-priced jobs.
Producing quotations usually involves only three main elements:
Estimating materials.
Getting subcontractor quotes.
Calculating how much employed labour you will need.
The first two are quite straightforward, although availability of subcontractors, and price increases on materials if delays occur can be an issue.
You can calculate materials or get a QS to produce a list for you. When it comes to subbies, they will usually give you a quote. That means the main area you need to master is the labour component. This is where your past experience is the most effective tool you have.
It takes time to become an accurate labour estimator – time and a consistent routine.
If you are not confident about estimating labour, then you need to take the time to master this important component of your business. It may be the difference between barely surviving and doing well. You can start now!
Outlined below are some simple steps you should have in place to develop a better labour estimating system. Once these steps have become routine, you should be able to produce fairly accurate labour estimates. This will enable you to offer fixed-price quotes with some level of confidence.
Identify typical sections
Divide your typical job into clearly defined sections (8 – 12 may be adequate). If you are using a construction or management software application, check that your sections are consistent with those in the software.
Examples of typical sections in a new build might be:
Site set-up
Excavation
Slab preparation
Framing and trusses
Roof
Joinery
Cladding
If you have more than one typical job, produce a set of clearly defined sections for each typical job.
2. Keep times
Set up a time-keeping system, so that team members record the hours worked in each section and for each job. When you tally these, you will know precisely how many hours have been spent on each section of a specific job. It’s a good idea to check that any time-keeping apps you use allow you to allocate hours to sections and to jobs.
Careful time recording is one of the most important records in a building business, yet it is one that very few builders do carefully. This means that if you do it well, you will be at an advantage in a competitive market.
Note: A careful time-keeping system is not only useful in quoting. You can use it to track the performance of your team/s on each job and identify quickly if a job is on schedule. A weekly review with the foreman discussing progress and projections will go a long way to keeping a job on track. If the job is getting behind, you will know sooner and be able to intervene early – this is one of the core activities to ensure financial stability in your business.
3. Build rates tables
From the information you get by tracking hours, you can develop rates tables to guide you in future estimating. The first time through, you will have rates from only one job. It’s important not to take your first time-keeping results as gospel, because it’s a very small survey size and even seemingly similar jobs can be very different in reality. The more jobs you track, the higher the likelihood that the average will be about right.
Once you have rates based on several jobs, you will be able to estimate with a growing level of confidence. Further, the different jobs will give you more benchmarks for comparison.
For example, a rates table (sample below) makes it reasonably easy to estimate the time for a specific floor using these actual times as a guide.
Note: It is a good idea to keep a record of the skill level of the people doing the hours on each job. If the make-up of the team changes, then you may need to make an allowance. For example, if a team of three highly skilled people did a section of a job in 100 hours, you might want to estimate 120 hours for a team of lesser skill. It’s worth noting that the total cost for the quotation may not be much different, as you will be paying the lower skilled team members less per hour.
It takes time to develop your rates tables, but once you have done this for each of your sections, you will be able to estimate labour with much more certainty. Then after you complete jobs that used your rates tables to estimate, you can check how accurate your estimates were, make any adjustments needed, and over time have more confidence in building your labour estimate.
4. Other considerations
If you are not confident about the labour component of a section, then tag it out of your quotation. It is better not to win a job, than to lose money on it.
Remember that the margins you add to materials, subcontractors and labour need to be sufficient to ensure that your company is both financially viable and returns an adequate profit to the shareholders.
So, investing time into your quoting system now will pay off in the long run.

When it comes to owning and running your own business, it’s easy to lose track of time. Here are some tips on how to improve your time management skills, so you can improve productivity and achieve growth
It’s possible to grow your business and still have free time, but to do so, you must overcome ‘the time trap’ – that time is its own master and is not managed by anyone.
Think of time as a resource that can be spent but not saved. Imagine a bank agrees to credit your account with $86,400 every day, on the condition that each night they cancel every dollar that has not been used.
Time is like that bank account. Each morning it deposits 86,400 seconds in your day and every night it takes out whatever you fail to spend. Your balance is never carried over, no matter what the reason. You can’t save time, you can only spend it.
“When you take decisive actions to plan and control the way you spend your time and factor in the time to work on your business you will find that you’re able to grow and develop your business and have time for more important things in your life
Here are five very simple yet practical steps to help you make the most of your time, so you can grow your business and still have time to do important tasks, unrelated to your business.
1. State your monthly priority: At the beginning of each month, set the number one activity that’ll bring you closer to your long-term goals. Usually this will be the activity that focuses on improving or growing your business. For example, if a long-term goal is to attract better customers, your next monthly priority might be to create a sales brochure that highlights the benefits of dealing with your company. Knowing your priority will help keep you focused on your long-term goals.
2. Run a weekly default calendar: Plan for the regular things you need to do to keep your business healthy – the important things that often get squeezed out by the demands of the day. Create a “Typical Week” diary and aim to keep to it. Select the regular activities that are important for your business and set aside blocks of time for these. During these blocks of time, focus solely on these activities.
3. Plan tomorrow tonight: Decide on tomorrow’s main tasks before you finish today and list them in your diary. While you sleep, your sub conscience will run through the list, getting you ready for the day, rather than worrying about what you should be doing. Schedule your most difficult tasks for the time of day when you are most productive.
4. Set achievable targets: The best way to ensure success is to practise being successful. Set yourself achievable targets. Set stretch goals, too, but make sure they can be accomplished. Don’t set impossible goals day after day. It’s soul destroying and compounds pressure. Tick off your tasks as you complete them: reschedule those you can’t and put a line through them.
5. Collate similar tasks: There’s a widespread myth that successful people multitask, but it’s not true. Multitasking means paying attention to multiple things simultaneously but the brain naturally focuses on one thing at a time, so when we ‘multitask’ the brain has to disengage from one activity in order to engage in another. Collate your tasks together. For example, if you’re working on pricing and quoting, shut the door, turn off the phone and mail notifications and focus on pricing that job.
When you take decisive actions to plan and control the way you spend your time and factor in the time to work on your business you will find that you’re able to grow and develop your business and have time for more important things in your life.

It’s a boom time for builders right now, but there are still some companies going bust. Ensure you’re not one of them, by setting yourself up for success
Here’s a snapshot of the latest business headlines: net migration is climbing (more people are moving to New Zealand than leaving); there is a massive shortage of commercial and residential construction in Auckland; the Christchurch rebuild is ongoing; interest rates remain low; banks are looking to lend.
Yet among those same headlines are stories about construction sector companies going under. Surely, in this ‘rock star’ economy, everything should be going well? Unfortunately, that isn’t the case.
At times like these, an expectation that a business should be profitable and successful tends to gloss over the fact that the construction sector is always a tough industry to be in. In this month’s article, we’ll look at a few reasons for this and some solutions.
It’s an undisputed truth that the most successful companies have a strong handle on their back office from day one. They have robust processes in place for their financial reporting and the collection and payment of debts; they track their jobs well from start to finish and generally know on a day-to-day basis how much any overrun or gain will affect the profit on every active job.
If you find that you aren’t making the money you expected to on a job, and aren’t sure why, it may be time for you to invest in a workflow management tool. These systems can tap straight into your accounting system (system dependent), making your life a lot easier.
Using the right system allows you to issue a quote to a customer, turn it into a full job and invoice the client once the quote is accepted. It also allows you to track costs more efficiently. Typically, a quote will include how much you expect to spend on materials and labour.
“If you find that you aren’t making the money you expected to on a job, and aren’t sure why, it may be time for you to invest in a workflow management tool
A workflow management tool can enable you to track the actual cost of key parts of the job against budget/quote. If you run over, it doesn’t solve the problem, but it allows you to take a closer look at the driving forces.
Are your materials costing too much? Did you miss the scope of the work in your initial quote? Are your employees and contractors costing too much? Whatever the answer may be, a workflow management tool can open up conversations between you, your suppliers and your customers.
If you’re aware of overruns early on, it’s possible to discuss the increase with the customer and adjust your quote. The key point is that you understand where, when and why things are running over budget, so you can act accordingly.
The system will also show what areas you are most efficient in. This can often be as important as knowing why you aren’t making as much as you should.
Of all the successful construction sector companies I’ve dealt with, each and every one of them has had robust relationships with their suppliers. It cannot be overstated how important this is, as suppliers are in business for the exact same reasons as you – to make money.
Advising them when you may fall short or need extra time to pay an invoice makes a big difference to ongoing business relationships. When dealing with suppliers, it’s useful to think of how you would like to be treated by your own customers. Silence is extremely unsettling, particularly when it comes to an overdue invoice.
With this in mind, try to avoid using your suppliers as a form of workable debt wherever possible. Again, consider how you would like to be treated if the roles were reversed.
“If you find that you aren’t making the money you expected to on a job, and aren’t sure why, it may be time for you to invest in a workflow management tool
Equally, chasing customers for payment is important for your business. Having the difficult conversation with a customer about an invoice is key, as it will give you an indication about when to expect payment. Early notification regarding a delayed payment will help you determine what steps you might need to take.
These could include securing the debt or, if necessary, stopping work on a project to save you from falling into the dangerous position of not being able to pay your own costs. While no one gets into business to become a debt collector, chasing debts early helps avoid problems further down the track.
If any of the topics covered in this article raise additional questions for you, we are more than happy to help.

Putting together a high-performing building crew is always a challenge – and an even bigger one in a tight labour market. Business coach Graeme Owen provides advice on how to do it right
So, you think you can’t get good builders? This is a common issue when labour is tight. Builders ask for more money or leave to join a team that pays more. Building companies start competing with each other for staff from an ever-decreasing pool. Your best team member leaves and starts up in business. Margins are squeezed and, unfortunately, some building companies go under.
But it is possible to overcome a tight labour market – if you are prepared to respond in a well-thought-out way. No matter how challenging the current climate is, it is only by taking decisive action that you will overcome it. What’s more, by doing so, you will not only get through this current time, but be better prepared for future challenges.
So, here are the five things you can do.
1. Be totally committed
Building and retaining a great team of builders doesn’t happen overnight – it takes effort, patience and decisive action by you, the business owner. More importantly, it is founded on your strong conviction that developing a highly skilled team is not only a priority, but inevitable. There is no other option. There is no Plan B.
As in any worthwhile venture, there will be setbacks. You won’t get it right the first time. You will make mistakes and some will be painful. There will be people you will need to let go and your growing team will make mistakes. But, if you persevere in your vision, you will get there. It’s not luck, it’s hard work – 95% give up. If you persevere, not only will your business grow, but you will grow personally!
2. Develop your plan
As in any high-quality build, a well-thought-out plan ensures better outcomes. This holds true in recruiting, training and building a team. The better the plan, the better the team.
Develop a clear picture of the kind of people you want in your ideal team, and the roles they will be filling.
Next, detail the steps you will take to advertise, interview, recruit and train.
Thirdly, outline the processes you will follow to ensure your team delivers what you expect. Finally, include a career track that shows how motivated employees can grow with the company.
Now, while your plan should be comprehensive, it need not be exhaustive. The important thing is to have your overall plan clear in your mind, so you don’t find yourself in a tight spot with no direction.
Without a doubt, your plan will need to change as your situation changes and the market moves, but you will always have a plan, based on the best information you have at that time. You will never be at a loss as to what to do.
3. Create multiple doors
Many builders rely on only one method of adding staff. It could be word of mouth, online advertising, Facebook posts or any other single method. While it works, everything is great.
However, in the real world, nothing is static. Things are always changing and what works today may suddenly stop working tomorrow. So, if you have only one door into the company and that door is blocked, then panic may ensue! I’m sure you have met at least one building business owner desperate for builders.
So, ensure that you offer multiple ways for potential team members to join your company. For example, you might consider:
Speaking at the local high school.
Offering apprenticeships to school leavers.
Advertising in the travel hospitality and tourism sector.
Offering adult apprenticeships to people needing a new career, a sales opportunity, or a general office administration role.
Advertising to mature builders looking to reduce their time on the tools and do pricing or project management.
Talking to current staff about friends and family who may be interested in a building career.
Posting team stories on Facebook and your website etc.
The more doors you develop, the more you will discover.
Further, avoid making the mistake of only looking for those people you need right now. Rather, look for good people continuously, so that when you find them you can either add them to your team or to a waiting list.
4. Stay the course
It’s always right to quit something that isn’t working, but it’s a big mistake to quit something that could work with a little improvement.
For example, a kitchen company advertised their services in a local paper and got no response. The obvious thing would have been to quit local paper advertising. Right? Wrong! Two weeks later they inserted exactly the same advert, but with an offer, and generated 11 phone calls. Exactly the same ad, with a slight modification. The key learning? Keep going. Test, modify, retest. Only quit something after you’ve tried several modifications.
It’s the same when building a team. Get the best advice you can when developing your team-building plan, writing adverts and position descriptions etc. Run your adverts in low-cost media first, then check responses, make small changes and test again. But most importantly keep testing. Don’t quit!
Also, don’t spend up large on recruitment adverts that you have not tested in a low-cost environment! Some advertising never works, so testing in low-cost media is essential.
5. Grow your skill
Don’t worry if you think you have little natural ability to grow and lead a team. You can’t create any more natural ability, but you can learn new skills. Talent just determines how fast you learn those skills. Sure, the very few with the most natural ability are likely to rise to the very top of their field, but those with relatively less talent, but who nevertheless learn the skills, also achieve a significant amount.
So, don’t panic if recruitment isn’t something that comes naturally – just practice the steps and grow your skill instead. It will get you a great team.

A large number of New Zealand businesses fail in their second year of operating – if you’re just starting out, you needn’t join them
When people say that running your own business is one of the toughest things you’ll ever do, they’re not joking. Finding funding, customers and coming up with a plan that makes your business stand out from the crowd can be tough.
However, once a business is established, it can become one of the most rewarding aspects of your life. The first year of working for yourself presents obvious hardships, and many people make the assumption that from there on in it will be smooth sailing.
After surviving your first year, don’t fall into the trap of rushing to buy that new ute and those sparkly tools, because a huge proportion of New Zealand businesses fail in their second year.
There are a number of reasons for this happening.
Prepare for Tax Part of the reason people may feel flush in their first year is largely because they haven’t yet had to make provisional tax payments.
Provisional tax is paid in instalments during the year in preparation for the expected year-end result. It is often estimated by the IRD based on the previous year’s results, plus 5%.
For example: if a business’s income tax payable in year one is $10,000, it will pay provisional tax of $10,500 the next year. If payments are missed, then the IRD will charge penalties and interest.
If a business made that $10,000 profit in year one, then it will essentially be paying two amounts of tax in one year – the balance for the first year and the estimated amount for the second. Cash flow will, therefore, immediately take a large hit for tax bills that weren’t present during the first year.
A good way to address this issue is to put aside 28% (the tax rate for companies) of net earnings at the end of each month into a savings account. This means that you will have enough money set aside for any tax payments.
Furthermore, given that you have already taken it out of the main cash flow accounts, it won’t be missed. By using a savings account, you will also earn interest on the balance.
Accounting for ACC Another bill that businesses miss during the first year is ACC. Like provisional tax, it’s based on the previous year’s results. In this case, it’s based on monthly PAYE returns that are completed.
The amount a business pays is based on the level of salaries and wages in the company’s tax return. The rate is a lot higher for builders than it is for those other industries, due to the inherent risks of working on a building site.
The very first invoice you will receive from ACC is for the previous year. However, it also includes an estimated amount for the next income year – similar to provisional tax. Again, it’s a bit of a double whammy.
Keep in mind that the estimated invoice is based on the first year. If it was just you working on the tools and then you hired a couple of workers during the second year, you will receive another invoice the following year to account for any underpayment.
It can feel a bit like you’re chasing your tail, but it’s simply a fact of life. Knowing that your invoice grows with the level of your wage payments means that you can adequately plan for this.
Wages, PAYE and other payments It is also crucial to keep in mind that other invoices will grow as your company does. PAYE and GST do not go away and it’s important to keep on top of them. Similarly, any missed payments to suppliers, subbies or employees could quickly lead to an empty worksite.
An important takeaway from all of this is the need for planning and communication. If you find yourself in a bit of strife, you need to establish which bills need to be paid immediately and those that can be delayed.
If you need to delay a payment, make sure you discuss this with the supplier. Communication always helps in any situation and keeps the relationship between yourself and the supplier strong.
The same goes for the IRD – if you are struggling to make payments, talk to them. Ask for an arrangement or a repayment plan and see if you can pay off the amounts in instalments.
By showing that you are willing to pay your bills and not avoid responsibility, it is more than likely that suppliers and the IRD will be happy to accept alternative arrangements. However, if you stay quiet, they will assume the worst.

Migrant workers come to New Zealand from a variety of countries and backgrounds. It is important as an employer that you provide them with the proper equipment and training, to help make them and their co-workers safe on New Zealand’s construction sites
Migrant workers can help fill labour and skill shortages in the construction sector; however, it’s essential that employers provide them with the proper equipment and training to ensure they and their co-workers are safe.
Immigration New Zealand provides direction on migrant workers’ rights and have simple tips on how to handle any confusion that may arise in its helpful guide Are You Employing Migrant Construction Workers ?
Over the next few issues of Under Construction , we’ll continue to feature content from this guide.
Migrant workers may come to your workplace with different understandings about work safety, and some of them may be unaware of hazards common to New Zealand’s construction sites.
It’s your responsibility to provide them with the right training, supervision and equipment, to ensure the workplace is safe for all your staff.
One of the most difficult things about coming to New Zealand is getting used to the variable climate. New Zealand has high levels of harmful ultra violet (UV) radiation. UV rays are still dangerous on cloudy or cool days and migrants may not be aware they are at risk of skin damage in such weather. It is important all staff are aware of this and have the appropriate protection.
You are required to tell migrant workers how to report any hazard, accident or near miss. They need to be told how to handle an emergency (such as a fire or chemical spill) and where emergency equipment and first-aid kits are kept.
The law says employees are responsible for their own safety at work. Make sure they have enough information, training and knowledge to complete a task.
Employers are obliged to ensure information is provided in a form that workers understand. For migrant workers, this may require information provided in their own language. Where literacy is an issue, information may be better provided verbally and supported in graphic form.
Migrant workers may speak English better than they can read it, write it or understand others speaking it. There may be support available for your workplace to get some English training where needed.
If you need an interpreter to help explain New Zealand safety requirements, contact Interpreting New Zealand on 0508 468 377, or at www.interpret.org.nz
Double check that your migrant workers know how to operate equipment safely, and use the right personal protective equipment (PPE). They may be unfamiliar with some equipment or New Zealand’s PPE requirements.
Make sure they know that employers and workers may be prosecuted if there is an accident where the law has not been followed. You can obtain advice on training from health and safety industry organisations – such as New Zealand’s Construction Safety Council, SiteSafe NZ or from your industry association.
“Migrant workers may come to your workplace with different understandings about safety at work. Your responsibility is to provide a safe workplace for all your staff, including migrants
“Having migrants go through an industry recognised health and safety programme will provide them knowledge to keep themselves and their co-workers safe on the work site. The construction sector, through the Construction Safety Council, has developed a framework to provide this certainty, so check with them to see if the training you are providing meets expectations.”
–Warwick Quinn, Chair of the Construction Safety Council of New Zealand
The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment maintains a list of approved health and safety courses, available here .
Slips, trips and falls (falls from heights are the most common cause of deaths in construction and even falls from a few metres can be fatal).
Being hit or crushed by falling objects and moving machinery.
Electrocution.
Loss of control of machinery or equipment.
Exposure to asbestos, chemicals or noise.

Running your own building business is no small feat, especially when the economy remains flat. However, just as excellent workmanship depends on the condition of your tools – and your skill in using them – so your business survival relies on maintaining and using good business strategies. In this article, Builder’s Business Coach Graeme Owen shares five ways you can make it work.
All builders should already know how to keep their tools in great shape – but what about the business side of things? That can be more difficult. If you’re struggling with that aspect, you need to read these five key strategies to keep your business in great shape.
As you pick up the following tools, take a moment to reflect on the business strategy it reminds you of.
1. Your hammer: essential services
Your hammer is the archetypical builder’s tool – reliable and necessary. You can’t be a builder without one.
In the same way, your business needs to focus on essential services – things that people can’t put off, no matter what happens in the economy. Think about urgent jobs, such as home repairs, roof replacements, fixing leaks and weatherproofing. These ‘must-do’ projects are the nails that can hold your business together right now.
Homeowners may not be planning big renovations, but smaller, essential jobs still need doing. If you focus your business on these opportunities consistently, you’ll keep your schedule full.
2. Tape measure: measure your costs
You’d never start cutting a length of timber without measuring – hopefully! Your tape measure helps you ensure your building is accurate. It helps to minimise waste and save time. As a kid, I remember building a cart and cutting several pieces too short. My dad swiftly reminded me to measure twice and cut once!
Your company’s finances need the same level of measurement.
Start by taking a close look at your expenses and note where your money is going. Cut out unnecessary expenses and talk to your suppliers about better deals or bulk discounts. Do you still need all those monthly subscriptions? Is it cheaper to repair rather than replace? Can the current ute last another year?
So, next time you pick up your tape, think about your costs.
3. Level: maintain client relationships
Ensuring the floor is level and the walls plumb is a basic building skill. You wouldn’t last long in the business if you couldn’t do this!
Similarly, strong and steady relationships with your current and potential clients provide the foundation on which any business is built. Clear, honest ‘straight up and down’ communication is key. So, update your clients on progress, offer transparent pricing, and tackle any issues they may have quickly. Don’t try to hide things!
You can go the extra mile here with almost no additional cost. Your clients will love it. For example, send a text when you reach a milestone, like putting down the concrete floor or getting a window replaced. Little communication extras can leave a lasting impression that helps to build trust. When your clients trust you, they’ll come back, and they’ll recommend you to others. Much like a perfectly leveled piece of work stands out, good client relationships give your business the foundation it needs to stand tall.
4. Skill saw: cut through the marketing noise
Social media marketing is bigger than ever, but it’s a crowded field and that can make it hard to cut through the noise and consistently reach potential clients. Just as you want your saw blade to be sharp, you need to keep your marketing sharp. So, here’s what to do! Showcase your craftsmanship online by sharing high-quality photos and videos of your work on Instagram and Facebook. Tell potential clients about your guarantees and share client stories. The more you remove their fear of dealing with you, the more you’ll cut through the marketing noise. And, don’t overlook local online groups. They’re free and can help you find jobs in your area. Networking can also be important. Partnering with architects, designers, or real estate agents can bring you opportunities and referrals.
5. Multi-tool: be adaptable
As well as all the above, you need to be adaptable and versatile – just like your oscillating saw. It’s your best friend for tackling a variety of jobs. So, be prepared to be versatile and remember, new opportunities are rarely repeats of past opportunities. If big projects are drying up, look for smaller jobs to keep cash coming in. Deck repairs, door installations and small renovations can fill the gaps. Team up with other tradespeople to offer bundled services. Or, if smaller work is drying up, check out the larger building companies. They may still have work for your team. Diversifying your services ensures that no matter what comes your way, you’re ready to handle it – just like your multi-tool.
Bringing it all together
The truth is, running your business during tough times isn’t much different from maintaining your tools. It’s about staying sharp, focused and flexible. You already know how to create sturdy, long-lasting work from raw materials. Apply that same mindset to your business and you’ll not only survive the tough times – you’ll come out stronger. Keep your tools sharp, both on the job and in your business, and you’ll build a foundation that lasts.

How do you recover when you know a job is going to run at a loss? By acting quickly!
A s a builder, it’s likely you’ll run into at least one job that starts to run at a loss. Even large companies have some jobs that just don’t go well.
It may be because of an oversight in pricing, mistakes requiring re-work, or because no one kept an eye on the schedule and the man-hours just blew out.
Whatever the reason, there is less money coming in than planned and, as the business owner, you must shoulder the additional financial pressure.
I’ve had the privilege of working closely with owners of building companies over the past 12 years and this is what I’ve learnt from observing those who have survived this type of setback.
Calculate how much income you have left
At the first hint of a problem in a job, do an analysis of the associated costs. This can be as simple as adding up all the money already spent on materials, subbies and labour and subtracting that subtotal from the total amount the client will be paying. This will give you an indication of how much you have left to spend before the job incurs a loss.
Make sure that you include any costs that you haven’t been invoiced for yet.
Estimate cost of completion
Estimate the materials and subbies you will need to complete the job and talk with your team about the remaining time (cost) required. Compare this total with the amount you have left to spend.
This will give you an indication of the job’s likely result.
Of course, this does not allow for the job to pay its share of overheads, but it does give a simple indication of the likely gross profit or loss.
It also gives you a target to achieve in order to break even or minimise the loss to a manageable amount.
Record any losses immediately
If you conclude that the job is going to run at a loss, then calculate the likely amount and build it into your financial accounts immediately.
Ultimately, the loss will be what it will be – but knowing its potential impact on your business in advance gives you options (see next section).
Don’t procrastinate and simply work harder, hoping it will go away. This is just delaying the pain. If you need to panic, then get it over and done with early.
Review all your options
Once you know the extent of the likely job loss, you can start identifying means to reduce its impact. Call a ‘Massive Action Meeting’ with your team.
Tell them that you need to identify every possible way to save costs across the company. Set the expectation that you intend to get the company through this challenge.
If it’s a labour overrun, then spend time brainstorming ways to become more efficient. It’s a good idea to do this not just for the immediate job, but for all the jobs you have running.
It may be that there are easy profits sitting in some of your other jobs that you can capture to offset the losses, examples include:
Scheduling work more carefully, so scaffolding can be removed early.
Planning material needs meticulously to reduce the cost and frequency of deliveries.
Rearranging the mix of qualified builders and apprentices onsite to reduce labour costs.
Talk to your subbies and suppliers about ways you might be able to save costs with them and check prices carefully to ensure you are getting your best rates.
While it may not be an easy conversation, it’s in everyone’s best interest to keep work profitable all round.
Avoid knee-jerk reactions
When our pet rabbit got frightened, he would react immediately by bouncing off the walls of his hutch! Heaps of activity, but nothing gained except bruises. Immediate reactions are not much better.
Once you have finalised your list of options, arrange them in order of difficulty and start implementing the easiest first. A quick success will encourage you and your team – and help you execute the more difficult strategies.
However, be careful about making strategic changes too quickly. Simply changing one strategy for another could compound the problem by replacing one ineffective activity with another.
Talk to your financial advisors
If you suspect that the loss could affect the viability of your business, talk to your advisors early.
Your accountant may be able to offset expected losses against tax already paid, your bank manager may be able to extend your overdraft, and a business consultant can give you some specific strategies to help guide you through.
Crashing out on a job can be painful and even critical to a business’ health, but it need not be the end – especially when you identify the problem and take action early.

Four strategies to help you successfully market your business to customers you really want to work with.
While the forecast of increased building activity across the country is positive, it doesn’t necessarily make life better for all small building companies. An abundance of building in a city doesn’t necessarily mean that every building company is doing well – it’s important to remember that potential new clients still need to be identified and attracted.
Often in building booms, it’s the larger building companies that gain most new business; smaller companies don’t always have the capital to gear up as quickly. Those larger companies are in a position to pick and choose clients, while turning away the more ‘difficult’ ones they don’t want to work with. This can leave smaller builders picking among ‘the dregs’.
But it needn’t be like that. There is no reason why, particularly in buoyant times, the smaller builder can’t also attract fantastic new clients. While they may not attract as many, it’s worthwhile putting in the effort. It can make a huge difference to the joy of doing business.
In this article, I identify four important strategies that will increase your chances of picking up great new clients.
You might think this is an obvious step, but in reality very few builders do it. When I ask builders to tell me who they really want to sell their services to, they look at me as though I‘m from another planet. It’s usually not something they’ve thought about in the past and it’s not something that’s taught to apprentices.
The thing is, your potential clients – people who want to buy a new home or renovate their existing one – come in all shapes and sizes. There are young couples on one income stretching to accommodate their young family, double-income professionals building an executive home or retiring couples about to build their dream home; all at different stages of life with varying aspirations.
So what does your perfect client look like? To help you visualise, think about your best clients – the ones you enjoyed dealing with and who liked having you as their builder. Note down three to four things about them. Wouldn’t business be much more enjoyable if all your clients were like these people?
Sales training tells us that potential clients are much more likely to choose suppliers who alleviate their frustrations, over and above those who simply deliver the service or product. So, provided other factors are more or less the same, the builder who removes a potential client’s frustration is far more likely to get the job.
If you really want to connect with your perfect clients, find out what it is that they find frustrating about building and builders in general. Ask them to be as specific as you can and remember that different client groups will have different views.
For example, the young family couple may be frustrated with builders who tell them they can’t give a fixed price quotation for their addition. For them, a price overrun is scary!
” To stand out in your marketing and advertising, limit information about yourself and instead focus on your perfect client
On the other hand, the retiring couple may be frustrated with the builder who doesn’t have the ability or willingness to vary from the plan and accommodate opportunities they discover as the build proceeds. For them, rigidity could be very disappointing.
Take every opportunity to find out what it is (about building and builders) that really annoys your perfect clients. This is probably the most powerful sales and marketing information you can have.
Many builders believe that good marketing is about telling their clients they are the best. They spend money on creating websites that are all about their company and how good they are. While this is not a bad strategy, sometimes it might give potential customers the perception that you are ‘just another salesperson’ – and everyone knows salespeople exaggerate the truth!
To stand out in your marketing and advertising, limit information about yourself and instead focus on your perfect client. Tell them about their frustrations, let them know that you understand their concerns and outline how you overcome these.
Don’t simply have a gallery on your website of work you’ve completed, because by itself it is all about you. Instead, include short client testimonials such as:
“With the last of their children moved out, Sarah and Geoff were keen to downsize slightly and design the eco-friendly home of their dreams. While price wasn’t a massive issue, being open to trying new green options was of paramount importance and they didn’t want a builder who wasn’t willing to adapt to their changing needs throughout the project.
They were very happy that Smith Builders was accommodating and understanding about their requirements and always took the time to understand their end goal.”
By so doing, you will be connecting with customers personally – and not be seen as just another salesperson.
Again, this sounds so obvious but it can be easily overlooked. Just last week, I spoke to a builder wanting to build homes in a new subdivision. However, there was not one single piece of advertising for his company anywhere in that subdivision! “So how will potential buyers find you?” I asked him.
It’s a similar situation for maintenance and renovation builders, many of whom don’t bother erecting signs outside the properties they are working on. How do they hope to attract others in the immediate area?
It’s also surprising how many builders don’t have a website. These days, there aren’t many clients who won’t go looking for your business on the internet before contacting you and, if you’re nowhere to be found, it’s unlikely you’ll get a call – even if it’s a referral.
Which of these four strategies are you using? If you’re looking for new clients, try the above – you may be impressed at the results!

The Successful Builder business coach Graeme Owen says that being busy isn’t always the road to maximum profitability
Finding yourself running in all directions ? If so, you’re not alone. Many builders I speak to are run off their feet keeping up with the demands of their business in the current building industry climate.
A common question I get asked is: “so, can I do anything about it” ? The answer is yes, you can!
In his book Good to Great (2001), Jim Collins draws on the old fable about the fox and the hedgehog. The fox hunts the hedgehog. He runs around every which-way, darting in here, sneaking up and jumping out there, trying to capture the hedgehog. He tries all kinds of tactics, but he fails every time – because the hedgehog is a master of one thing and one thing alone: defence. He rolls into a ball and sticks out his spines. It wins every time! On the other hand, the fox is a master of none.
Now Collins draws on the story to formulate his ’Hedgehog Concept’.
It’s in busy times that business owners tend to act like a fox – rushing here and there doing heaps of different things without any clear focus. The result is often lots of energy expended, yet very little achieved.
When that same business owner focuses on what they (and/or the business) does best and gives it their full attention and enthusiasm, they tend towards better results. Just like the hedgehog – it is safer to do one thing really well than heaps of things not so well. So how do you apply the lesson of the hedgehog ?
1. Find your passion
It’s always hard to do work about which you’re not passionate. For example, many trades people I know didn’t really enjoy sitting at a desk in school. It was boring. But put them in a garage with tools and materials and they’d turn out all kinds of stuff. What’s more, they’d stay in that garage for hours on end – even missing dinner – because making things is their passion.
So, what is it that you or your company does that you are really passionate about ? And don’t tell me ’good quality work’. That’s too vague. Go for the stuff that really gets you going. Start talking with your team about their reasons for going to work (your company purpose) – about what makes them willing to go the extra mile (their passion), about what excites your clients (your company mission). Get these things aligned and you will locate huge resources of untapped energy and power.
For example, one of my clients decided that what really lights his fire is visualising innovative solutions for his customers. It’s something his design team gets excited about and it’s what makes the foreman’s job interesting and challenging. His clients buy into their enthusiasm and love interacting with them.
What difference would it make if you were able to unlock the full passion potential of yourself, your team and your clients ?
2. What you do best
The hedgehog does one thing better than all others. So, think about what it is that you do better than anyone else – in your world. It may help if you eliminate the things that you are not the ‘best in your world’ at doing, as it helps you focus. Sure, it will take time, but when you locate one thing that you and/or your company are really, really good at, you can then grow your sense of success by being repeatedly successful in that one thing.
If you can build your marketing and sales around that one thing, it will set you apart from all others.
For example, another of my clients discovered that in his area, he was the best re-roofer. By utilising his building and renovation skills with the relatively straightforward work of roofing, he was able to quickly teach his team how to become really, really good at it. And then he was able to market it with confidence.
3. Profitability
Study the metrics of your business to discover what your main economic engine is. You may discover that one aspect of your business is way more profitable than another.
Some time ago, one of my clients realised that he was extremely good at training 3rd and 4th year apprentices to lead small teams of 1st and 2nd year apprentices on standard group home new builds. At that time in his area, while new builds provided steady work, they were not highly profitable. However, when we analysed his teams’ performance, we discovered that the new-build part of his business was the most profitable.
So, it can be very worthwhile to discover what parts of your business are the most profitable.
4. Overlap
Once you have identified the above three things, then look for places where they overlap. That area of overlap can become your ‘Hedgehog Concept’.
Once you know it, you can then shape your company vision around it and start to focus your thinking about how to work that vision out in all areas of your business.
Go the hedgehog!

Your website is often the first impression potential clients have of your building business. But is it showing them what they actually want to see? In this article, The Successful Builder Graeme Owen details what builders need to do to present themselves in the best possible way online
In 2025, homeowners across New Zealand are doing more online research than ever before. They’re comparing builders, checking reviews, looking at past projects – and making decisions before picking up the phone. So, what turns a visitor into a lead? Let’s look at what your website really needs to include.
Reflect your ideal client
People stop scrolling when they see someone like themselves. That’s why the most effective builder websites don’t just show houses — they show people and lifestyles that your ideal clients can relate to.
Think about your typical customer. Are they families with young kids? Retirees? First-home buyers? Investors? Your images, language and project examples should help them see themselves working with you.
Tip: Use real client photos when possible. Include short stories or testimonials from ‘people like them’.
Address their needs – not just their wants
Clients may come to you asking for three bedrooms and a double garage, but what they really need might be more nuanced – such as future proofing, peace and quiet, flexible spaces for teenagers, or better indoor-outdoor flow.
A good website doesn’t just list features, it helps your visitors think about their lifestyle and what would really improve it.
Tip: Ask smart questions through your content. For example:
Will you be working from home?
Do you expect to host extended family?
What will your family look like in 5 or 10 years?
These prompts show you care about your clients’ long-term happiness – and that builds trust.
Provide testimonials that tell a story
Modern website visitors are looking for proof that you’ve delivered on promises for people like them. Generic compliments won’t cut it anymore. A good testimonial is really a mini case-study and can even include how challenges were overcome when they arose. Someone fixing a bad situation is often more memorable than simply having a good experience.
Structure them like this:
What the client needed.
What they were worried about.
What they got – and how they felt about it.
Tip: Get testimonials that highlight the client’s journey and the outcome, not just praise about you.
Use optimised content that still sounds human
To show up on Google, your website needs the right keywords – but it also needs to sound natural. Google’s ranking system is now smarter than ever, prioritising content that is genuinely helpful and easy to read. Use key words in your page headings, image alt text and early in your content – but always make sure it reads well.
Make sure it’s simple, clear, and built for mobile
Once you’ve drawn people in, don’t lose them to a slow or confusing website. Builders often overlook the importance of mobile responsiveness and clear navigation – but these make a huge difference to how professional you seem.
Tip: Make it easy to view galleries and testimonials on mobile. Include a visible phone number or enquiry form on every page and don’t hide your best content behind five clicks.
Final thoughts — and a quiet suggestion
Your website doesn’t need to be flash – but it does need to feel personal, professional and purposeful. It should guide your ideal clients, answer their questions, and it should make them feel confident in taking the next step.
If your current site isn’t quite hitting the mark, it’s worth connecting with someone who understands the building industry and knows what works online. I work closely with a small team, which specialises in creating websites for tradies – feel free to reach out and I’ll happily point you in the right direction.

Most builders I know don’t like waiting, whether it is for subbies or suppliers; however, waiting for a client to respond a quote has to be the worst. It might be less stressful if you thought your quotes were likely to be accepted…
I call it Quote Wait Syndrome (QWS) and I’m sure it’s a feeling familiar to many of you. Unfortunately, it’s impossible to force your clients to buy what you think they should (although some tradies try really hard to do this).
It’s also impossible to get them to pay what you think they should for the work they do want (and many tradies attempt this one). However, it is possible to greatly improve the chances of getting a positive response if you start out correctly from the very first meeting.
Here are four things you can do that will greatly improve your ability to win the quoting game and reduce your QWS!
1) Work harder on the estimate
I wish I could be paid a dollar every time a quote is rejected for the reason that it’s “way more than we expected”. The client thinks $300,000, but the cheapest quote is $380,000!
In this instance, everyone loses. Ever had this happen to you?
It happens because no one really knows how much a project is going to cost until after it has been carefully quantity surveyed, priced and finally built.
If you are building new units or homes with similar dimensions, then you will know exactly how much the new build is going to cost. This gives you an advantage, as you can quote a definite price right up front, excluding a few variables.
This level of detail isn’t possible when quoting for renovations and additions, but most customers still want to know how much it is going to cost.
To avoid disappointment for yourself and your client, spend sufficient time working out a rough estimate before you start the serious design/quoting process.
Don’t proceed until you have settled on a really good indication of what you believe the initial proposals are going to cost, otherwise you’re wasting your and your subbies’ time by quoting something that is not going to be built.
This way, you can rest assured that when your quotes are presented they are not going to be rejected because they are way over the top.
2) Be pessimistic
Always, always, always add more to your initial rough estimates than you think your clients can handle.
I’ve never heard of a renovation that has not exceeded the initial estimate. Things are discovered and added along the way, so the final price is almost always well above.
For some clients it doesn’t matter – those who were referred to you and for whom price is not really the issue – however, for price-conscious clients, your rough estimate will sound like a fixed price no matter how much you tell them otherwise. That first number is the one that sticks. So make sure that you add heaps to your initial rough estimate.
A good idea is to back-cost several renovations and compare your initial rough estimate with the finished cost. Use this as a guide. That way your rough estimates are likely to be closer to the actual finished cost.
If you allow for variations and extras in your initial rough estimate, then once the design is done your quote is less likely to cause surprise.
3) Work the budget
Once you have a good ‘worst-case’ estimate, ask your client if that’s what they had in mind. If so, then you can proceed safely.
If it is too high, then you need to revisit what they are asking you to do. Don’t move onto the ‘firm’ estimate or quote stage until you have a really good agreement on a rough estimate.
If they are not ready to talk about their budget, then ask: “If we were to come back to you with a firm estimate/quote for around this amount, would you be happy to proceed with us?”
The truth is that your clients will likely have no idea of actual renovation costs, so getting them to face the reality early will improve the likelihood of them accepting your quote.
4) Tell stories
Now I can hear you ask: “if they knew the actual finished cost, they might not even start”, or “someone will come along and give a really low ball park figure and they will go with it. How can we compete?” This is a very real dilemma.
Don’t compete, tell stories.
If you have cases where a client has gone with a cheap quote, but ended up paying more, then go back to the client, find out how much they actually paid, and compare that with what they would’ve paid if they had signed with you.
Get them to tell you how they felt when the costs kept climbing and climbing. If you don’t have your own stories, ask some of your colleagues.
Get together a set of real stories that show what happens when costs are not estimated carefully at the beginning. Make sure that you get the facts straight and stick with them. Don’t malign the builder who estimated cheap and cost heaps. He may have just had no idea!
The idea is to demonstrate how failure to estimate/quote carefully at the beginning can lead to a disappointing outcome. It takes time to do this with your client, but if they get a true indication of the likely price of their project at the beginning, there is less chance your quote will be rejected for the ‘cheapie’.
Follow these steps and you are likely to reduce your Quote Wait Syndrome!

Good habits can lead to success, whatever the size and location of your building company. Ditch the ways that aren’t working for you and follow the lead of the examples below.
While not every builder sets out to become the most successful builder in the world – or even New Zealand – most want to be among the best. However, comparing yourself to some of these high achievers – such as the three building companies in Deloitte’s Fast 50 – Fastest Growing Companies this year (Griffbuild, Selah Renovations and Xigo) – can be a bit overwhelming.
Growing a building business can be hard and yet, for some, it seems easy. It also seems there’s no winning formula. Some builders don’t touch renovations, while others swear by them. Some only employ staff and others only sub-contractors. Some operate in large cities and others in regional centres. Yet, in almost every case, success comes down to a few habits; it’s the things they do, not necessarily the stuff they know, that makes the difference.
The good news? Habits can be imitated, so do yourself a favour and make them yours!
You see it reflected in their personal disciplines, their thinking and, often, their waistlines – successful builders act as ultimate owners of everything that happens in their company. They take responsibility, which shows up clearly when something goes wrong. While others might look to blame or rant at someone, a successful builder steps up, takes ownership and looks at what can be done to improve the company.
For example, when a customer complains, a successful builder doesn’t simply blame a staff member. Since the incident happened in his company, he looks for what he did, or didn’t do, that contributed to the unwanted outcome and determines what he can do going forward, so it doesn’t happen again.
A less ‘in-control’ builder might simply lay blame and not try to find out where their action (or inaction) might have contributed. Consequently, they makeno changes and it happens again.
Decide today to take responsibility for everything that happens in your business!
Successful builders usually go for the high-value activities and leave low-value activities alone – completely, in some cases. This keeps them from filling their days with low-value tasks, while rushing around saying “I don’t have time”.
There’s always someone else who can do your lower value jobs. Find them, make them happy and then focus on your higher value tasks. You also need to prioritise those higher value tasks as urgent, because high-value tasks rarely need to be done right away! However, when you make them urgent and do them right away, you’ll find yourself becoming time rich, which has to be good.
Redefining the urgent sometimes means passing up opportunities. This is hard if you’re an entrepreneur but, if it doesn’t fit the business plan, don’t waste time.
Another common problem that many builders encounter is overestimating what they can do in a week and adding all sorts of time wasters, instead of staying focused on a few key things that can be achieved within a set timeframe.
For example, one of my clients, Andrew, grew his presence as the builder of choice in his area by employing teenagers to deliver 500 mailbox flyers every week, month after month, because it worked. Results, though thin to start with, grew over time and Andrew was able to build a maintenance crew of six builders and a renovations crew of eight.
Make sure to determine where you should focus your efforts and don’t let your low-value tasks distract you!
“Successful builders act as the ultimate owners of everything that happens in their company
Do you live to work or do you work to live? Sometimes it may seem that, to be successful, you need to work 24/7 and neglect your personal life. While hard work is admirable, and necessary to be achieving great results, it doesn’t mean that a work-life balance isn’t important.
With his new project manager on board, another client of mine found he actually had time to focus on the really important stuff – like helping his wife with their new baby! Instead of filling his new-found time with busy stuff, he took the time away from his business for his life outside of work. He told me that having a baby to care for gave a whole new perspective on business – “it’s only as good as the life it supports!” Wow!
What an observation. It’s true; most successful builders I’ve worked with make sure to enjoy the life their work provides. Letting your personal life take a back seat can wear builders out and make them resentful for doing so.
So, step back and take a look at your own work-life balance. Are you allowing yourself enough time to enjoy the life you’re working hard to sustain?
A building business is never static. Growth is never mapped on a straight line. One month income is up, the next it’s down. You might have several large quotes out there and get none of them, then suddenly you’re turning away work. This is all very stressful for the builder who doesn’t study the fundamentals of his business such as quote conversion rate, site productivity, gross profit and more.
However, a successful builder checks the fundamental indicators of his business regularly. Even when times are good, he is aware how his business is performing and, if something isn’t up to par, takes decisive action early before it becomes a problem!
If the number of enquiries converting to quotes starts to drop, it’s important to find out why and makes changes. Maybe the market is losing ground and your marketing is attracting the wrong people, or maybe the sales team is lagging.
If productivity is lagging, the successful builder makes changes in his team straight away. Whatever the problem, early identification and early intervention minimises future pressure.
So, whether business is booming or lagging, take a step back, figure out what’s impacting the trend and figure out how to change or maximise the situation.
It really is true. Success is less about what you know, and more about what you do with what you know. You can do what you’ve always done or you can start practising the habits of successful builders.

Builders’ business coach Graeme Owen says making good decisions can be a difficult process that involves deliberation, sleep and some solid guiding principles
I recently spoke to the owner of a large building company with good buying power and supply lines. He was asked by a small builder if he would sell him materials, as he was having difficulties obtaining supplies. In the past, it would have been no problem but today he was reluctant to do so.
“If I help him out, it may affect my ability to build tomorrow,” he said.
Should the builder help his colleague, or should he take care of himself first ? It’s a classic conundrum.
I talked to another builder, who had rented warehouse space to stockpile hard-to-get materials. Is this wise, or will it just compound the material shortages problem ?
Again, this raises further questions. Is it selfish to stockpile when resources are scarce, or is it prudent and responsible ?
Difficult problems rarely have simple answers. For example, it is never right to covertly substitute inferior materials. But when a problem is complex or personal, there are many possible answers and more thinking needs to be done. There are more issues to weigh up.
The reality is that, in business, you don’t often have the luxury of long debates and discussions. You have to make decisions in the moment and sometimes there are hard calls. Especially in difficult times.
So how do you go about making good decisions in complex times ? Here are four strategies I find useful:
1. Know your numbers
Knowing where your business is at financially is crucial in tough times. You may have coped well on gut feel in the past but, in the current changing environment, you will need to read things differently. When the goalposts shift, you need to play a different game.
Knowing your numbers on a weekly or monthly basis will give you the real (actual) information about your business performance, so you can make more informed decisions. Build a simple dashboard and look for trends – small changes over several weeks/months, then tie any new decisions you make to one (or more) of your indicators and watch them carefully over the coming weeks/months. Look for small changes. If these are concerning then review your decision immediately, learn from it and make another (better) decision.
2. Revisit your values In the case above, my business owner friends were torn between two overlapping fields of influence – self-interest and looking out for other members of the building fraternity. How do we balance these in a way that preserves both ? The reality is that we live in both spheres and thrive when both our business and our community thrive. Unfortunately, there is no easy answer here and those who say there is are not sitting where you are at the moment.
I will never forget an older property investor saying he would always make sure to leave some on the table for the next person. For example, in a rising market, he would not wait until the property market had reached its absolute peak and then sell. Rather, he would sell when he had made good gains. For one thing, you can’t predict that peak anyway. Furthermore, if you are right at the top then there is no capital gain left for the next buyer and you may get a lesser price! He was guided by his deeper value of making sure the other person does well too.
So what are the values you operate under ? These will shape your motivations, and ultimately your decisions and choices. You might want to call them your business principles. Now might be a good time to remind yourself of those deeper values or principles for which you want to be known or remembered.
For example, integrity guided my builder friend to stockpile materials so that he could keep his promise to his client to complete the job. What will your values tell you ?
3. Be courageous You don’t have the benefit of experience in rapidly changing times. However, you still need to make decisions, as it’s indecision rather than wrong decisions that wipe out small businesses. But making decisions requires courage, so be courageous. Weigh up the evidence, seek the best advice you can get and make your decision. The thing is, if it turns out to be a wrong decision, then make another! But do so courageously!
Another thing – don’t be afraid to learn from mistakes. No successful business owners that I know have only made correct decisions. Every one of them has made wrong decisions. But they have not stopped at the wrong decision. Rather they have used their experience to learn how to make better decisions in the future.
4. Choose your timing Important decisions are rarely urgent and urgent decisions are rarely important. So learn to know the difference, then protect yourself when making important decisions. Refuse to make them on the fly or with limited information.
Try to schedule your decision making time and make sure you are at your best. Most people make better decisions in the morning after a good night’s sleep – choose the best time for you. Review all the information and check your calculations several times. Then, once you have made your decision, let it sit for a few hours before acting on it.

For many, 31 March is the end of the financial year. Often it sneaks up quickly, leaving a lot of work to do. Taking the right steps ahead of time, however, could save a great deal of time, stress and pain
A s one of life’s great constants, tax needs to be on a business owner’s mind year-round. The end of the financial year is no exception. Tax payments due in the two months following 31 March include:
Terminal tax for the previous year – due 7 April (for taxpayers who have got time extensions through their accountants).
The third provisional tax payment – due 7 May .
GST for the period ending March 2017 – due 7 Ma y .
It’s crucial you have a good handle on how your business has gone in the financial year. The end of the financial year provides the perfect opportunity to speak to your accountant about the issue of tax – in particular, whether you have paid enough.
As the IRD charges companies 8.27% interest on terminal tax amounts higher than $2,500, it’s critical to ensure you have paid enough tax before it’s too late.
For those operating as sole traders, or in partnerships in their first year of trading, a voluntary tax payment before 31 March can provide a much-needed discount on any terminal tax payment that may be due.
Avoid Penalties
The IRD charges penalties and interest for any non-payments on provisional tax dates, where it deems payments should have been made.
Therefore, even if you pay the full amount of provisional tax on 7 May that you should have paid during the year, the IRD will still charge non-payment penalties and use-of-money interest.
A way to avoid this is through a Tax Pooling system, where you ‘purchase’ your tax at a lower interest rate in order to avoid these penalties.
This is something you should discuss with your accountant, particularly if you operate in a seasonal industry, or if you have won contracts that have significantly increased your bottom line during the financial year.
Unpaid Invoices
Have you been having problems with collecting payments from some of your debtors during the year ?
If so, a quick review of your debtor ledger to assess how straightforward the debt recovery process will be is an important part of the year-end process.
The IRD allows for tax deductions of uncollectible amounts – or ‘bad debts’ – only if they are removed from your debtor ledger before the end of the financial year.
These removals may be reversed if the debt is unexpectedly collected later; however, these recoveries need to be included as fully assessable income for tax purposes.
Tools and Fixed Assets
Does your fixed asset schedule include any tools that are broken, obsolete, have been replaced or stolen during the period ?
If so, these should be removed from your fixed asset schedule, for which a tax deduction amounting to the written down value (cost less accumulated depreciation) can be claimed.
Bonuses and Holiday Pay
Have you paid, or do you plan to pay, any bonuses for the 2017 financial year ?
Employee benefits such as holiday pay and bonuses owing at 31 March can be claimed for tax purposes, if paid by 2 June (within 63 days of balance date).
Bonuses must be finalised before 31 March in order to be claimed; bonuses dependent on conditions satisfied after this date cannot be claimed.
While we’ve highlighted a number of points to consider, there are many other areas that business owners need to focus on in the run-in to year-end.
Balance date can approach very quickly, but by taking a step back from the tools and looking at the numbers, you can save yourself time and money.
If you do have questions about the end of the financial year, please contact Stuart Ruddell at stuart.ruddell@crowehorwath.co.nz; or contact your local Crowe Horwath advisor.

To ensure you get the best return on your marketing investments, take some time to understand your audience. By targeting specific people with specific messages, you’ll hit the nail on the head every time!
Remember the scene from Minority Report , where Tom Cruise enters a shopping mall and is spoken to by advertising billboards? Identity recognition devices scan the retina of approaching people and access databases full of their preferences. The billboards then address passers-by with advertising messages specifically tailored to their needs and wants.
Marketers have touted the power of targeted direct marketing for decades and paraded examples of successful campaigns, which have gone straight to the right person, at precisely the right time. Of course, they located those most likely to need their clients’ services in advance.
For example, a colleague determined that just 15 companies in his area could be considering his services now. In one week, he sent three communications to the companies’ respective CEOs before calling. This resulted in him taking on board eight new clients! All he did was target people currently considering his services.
The power of targeting hasn’t changed, but it’s dependent on having detailed information about the people you want to reach.
It’s true that you might not be able to scan eyeballs and access personal preferences, but with targeted advertising through social media, you can certainly get close.
Simply construct your adverts with particular preferences in mind, then specify that your ads only reach people with those preferences – now that’s powerful.
It may be that you want to reach only parents, married people, just women, people in a particular age group or profession etc. The list goes on and on.
To avoid pouring your money down the social media drain, make sure you have really good answers to these three questions:
While you might assume that everyone needs a builder – and you may be correct – it’s important to remember that your potential customers don’t view it that way.
They don’t want a builder, they want a full internal makeover or an external reclad. Maybe they want more bedrooms, or a more useable living area, or they could have a young family and want to add a nursery area.
Mature couples may want to create an entertaining dining/kitchen area, a more conversation friendly lounge or a custom-built dream home.
Again, the list goes on: an ecologically friendly smart house, an executive-level family home or a retirement cottage…
And, while all these potential customers might need a builder to carry out these desires, different people are looking for different things. You can’t target them all, which leads us to our second question:
This is perhaps the most important question you can ask, because the answer could determine the future shape of your business.
You see, when you know who you are targeting, your business approach changes. By specialising, you start to become an expert.
Think about your ideal clients; the ones you enjoyed working with, who appreciated your work and/or who were happy with your prices and introduced you to other customers. Usually ideal clients will make up 20 – 30% of your client base, and these people are likely to be your best target market.
For example, when I began business coaching, I worked with any and every business. However, at least 60% of my clients were builders – it just seemed to happen! They also always got the best results. When I finally realised this (my blinding flash of the obvious), I realised they were my target market and I’ve since focussed on marketing to, and serving them better.
Finding your target market and focusing on it is the best way to strengthen your future, which leads us to our final question:
This is an area where many business owners make an understandable – but significant – error. It’s important that your marketing appeals to your customers’ interest, not yours.
For example, print adverts that only focus on promoting the business are called tombstone ads. This is because most people simply don’t notice them. Just like tombstones, they are of little interest to the living.
‘Here lies <BUSINESS NAME> whose claim to fame is <BUSINESS LOGO> located at <BUSINESS ADDRESS>.’
Smart print advertisers work to capture the interest of their target market with a powerful headline, or an irresistible offer that assures a second look – but you can pay a lot for this service.
However, thanks to social media channels and Google analytics, you can now place your ad in front of people who are already interested. All you need to do is select the right interests, pay a few dollars and, as a result, your ad will appear on the social media streams exposed to the audience you’re targeting – perfect!
Yet this type of advertising will be useless, unless you make sure to include their interests, not yours.
For example, parents of teenagers may want an additional bedroom but they’re not interested in home building. If your message is targeted to people with home building as an interest, your ad won’t reach them. Instead, ask yourself what parents with teenagers might be interested in – sports? Camping? Movies? Survival!!
In a similar vein, a couple needing a nursery may be much more interested in raising young kids, child development or educational toys than in home renovation! Once again, the social media interest listings of your target market may have very little to do with your own interest listings.
Just because a couple has a need, does not mean they have an interest. For example, everyone needs a bathroom, but not many people would list bathrooms as an interest.
In conclusion, to use this strategy to your advantage, build a list of the interests of your best clients and target your ads at these.
By understanding the specific interests of your market, your social media messages can speak directly to the kind of people you want to do business with. Just like in Minority Report .

Want to add ‘multi’ before your million-dollar building business? It takes more than simply winning new contracts – you need to update and reshape your business model, if you want to take it to the next level
The first step many builders take after establishing themselves is to grow their business into a million-dollar company that employs five to eight builders. Done properly, it can return a decent income.
It doesn’t matter that the business demands the owner’s full attention and that it’s busy – it feels good to be in control of your own destiny. What’s more, given the right support, a builder can get to this stage quite quickly.
Many make a lifestyle choice to stay at this size, but others want to go to the next level, where they are completely off the tools.
To get there, you can’t just keep adding jobs and builders. There aren’t enough hours in the day to do everything required – a new business model is necessary.
Below are three things to consider prior to expanding, plus two models to consider when you’re ready to go to the 12-15 builder level.
1. Get a clear estimation of your own strengths:
Just as a sports coach allocates players to their areas of strength, you need to allocate yourself to the area of the business where you’ll achieve the best results.
Essentially, there are two options in a small business – getting work in and doing it. While you can do both when the business is small, you can’t as it grows.
Decide if you are better at getting work in, or getting work done.
Are you better in the area of sales or project completion? Do you enjoy following up enquiries, selling, estimating and getting contracts signed? Or do you prefer running and managing jobs on time, to budget?
Both are essential for the success of the company, but it’s likely you will be more effective at one.
2. Evaluate your team:
Take a good look at the character and skill level of the people in your team. Are they able to work unsupervised? Do you have foremen (or site managers) able to make the technical decisions required as the build progresses, or do they need your expert input? Are they able to manage the performance of other team member(s) and keep to schedule, or do they need to be hurried along?
Knowing the make-up of your team now is a good indicator of the people you’re likely to attract in the future. It makes sense to think about structuring your business with this in mind.
Of course, you also need to look at areas where your team is lacking and consider how to evolve your structure as you add these skills to your team.
3. Step up your reporting systems:
As your business grows, you have to delegate more, while relying on your team’s ability to work without your immediate supervision. This is the natural corollary of delegation.
You can’t delegate without knowing precisely what is happening in the company at any time: eg, how close to schedule/budget is each job running?
You need this information quickly and routinely to make informed decisions – the kind of immediate information you had when your company was much smaller.
“To get there, you can’t just keep adding jobs and builders. There aren’t enough hours in the day to do everything required. A new business model is necessary
So, before racing to grow, check that you have procedures in place that give you accurate information. If you don’t, you can start by using paper forms. It’s a good idea to scope out a decent reporting programme and install it early, so you don’t need to make system changes as the business grows.
Model 1A: Owner on sales – employ a qualified project manager
In this model, the owner is focused on getting the work in and the building work will be delegated.
The current team members are not highly skilled and aren’t experienced enough to be left in charge of the whole job; they require direction and help with:
Scheduling work.
Making strategic technical decisions.
Organising and supervising subcontractors.
Arranging material deliveries.
Dealing with clients.
Recording and pricing variations.
Employ an experienced builder as a project manager, who can:
Manage schedules.
Manage subcontractors and budgets.
Deal with clients and give technical advice.
An added attraction is that such a project manager is able to upskill team members.
Model 1B: Owner on sales – employ a project assistant
In this model, the owner focuses on sales. But the team contains leaders experienced at:
Running their own jobs.
Organising schedules.
Liaising with subcontractors.
Staying on target.
Managing variations.
Dealing with clients.
Understanding budgets.
What is needed is someone to support and assist them in managing start dates, collating new job information and preliminary coordination. They need not be building qualified, but should understand a build process.
An added benefit is that they may be able to assist you with other office duties.
Model 2: Owner works as project manager – employs a salesperson
In this model, the owner delegates getting work in to a professional salesperson. It helps immensely if the salesperson has building knowledge, since they will often be asked to give advice on what is possible. An older, experienced builder with sales skills can be a real find.
However, it is essential that they faithfully represent the company. There is nothing more detrimental to a company’s reputation than a salesperson who over-promises.
Many professional salespeople prefer commission selling, and become a direct expense rather than an overhead.
When you’re ready to punch through the multi-million barrier, give serious thought to drafting a model that best suits your company.

The issue of contractors versus employees is an ongoing issue that has been covered before in Under Construction – with the summer rush fast approaching, it’s one that is worth revisiting
W hen hiring a new team member, remuneration options are often an afterthought. Both salary and withholding tax payments have their pros and cons, but simply choosing based on what works better for you and your business is a relic of the past. It is important to understand the details behind each ‘type’ of worker.
Employees
Employees have Pay As You Earn (PAYE) tax, which includes any ACC levies, student loan, KiwiSaver or other superannuation payments (all where applicable) deducted from each salary payment. This means that unless they have other income in their name, their core taxes are paid on their behalf by their employers. The onus for these payments is on the employer, and any non-compliance with the law regarding these is a matter settled between the employer and the IRD. Tax returns can be filed with the IRD by way of Personal Tax Summaries.
Employees are also fully entitled to holiday pay and sick leave payments from their employer. This is by far the simplest approach to personal income tax for a worker, but is more complicated for the employer.
Contractors
Conversely, if you hire someone as a contractor, the task of complying with New Zealand Tax Law is more arduous for the worker, while it’s simpler for you.
Labour-only building contractors have 20% withholding tax, withheld by the payer and administered at the same time as PAYE, but are still required to file an income tax return each year and pay any additional tax (based on their marginal tax rates). Most other contractors do not have withholding tax withheld, but may be required to make provisional tax payments throughout the year.
They are also able to claim certain expenses against their income, such as travel necessary for work, or, in a builder’s case, expenses for repairs and maintenance on any tools they use in the course of their work, along with depreciation on tools and vehicles.
Contractors are required to be GST registered if they earn over $60,000 in a 12-month period, and must file a full income tax return at the end of the financial year. Contractors are not entitled to sick leave or holiday pay, and are not able to take up personal grievance claims against the employer.
How do I tell the difference? As shown above, there are definite advantages and drawbacks to each party in each situation. However, the decision to hire someone as a contractor or an employee does not rest simply on what works best for your business!
The best method to decide how to treat your worker for tax purposes is to consider the following areas:
Do they have the ability to work for another employer on another job while working for you? If they do, then they would fall under the contracting realm of employment.
Who dictates the amount to be paid to the worker? If the worker is planning on invoicing based on an hourly rate that they have offered to the employer, they would be deemed a contractor. However, if the worker is paid a set rate based on the employer’s discretion, they would be viewed as an employee.
Can the worker take holidays as they wish, or is it up to the employer’s discretion? If holiday periods are dictated by the employer, then the worker is likely to be deemed as an employee.
Do they supply their own tools for work? If they supply the majority of their own tools, which are not paid for by the employer via any tool allowance contribution, or are expected to provide their own tools, then they would likely be deemed a contractor. An employee would not be expected to provide their own tools.
Does the worker invoice the employer for hours completed on jobs? If so, they are a contractor. Employees are paid a rate based on a full day of availability for work, whether the work is there or not. Contractors only get paid based on the hours they work.
These are just a few examples of areas that the IRD look at. And as you read through the above methods, it is easy to see why it has become a grey area for businesses.
In certain situations, it may be that a worker meets some of the tests for being an employee, while also meeting some of the criteria for being a contractor.
What is important is that all reasons for the treatment of a worker are documented, with a rigorous process being followed to determine their nature. Essentially, the less control a business has over a worker and their activities, the more likely they are to be deemed a contractor.
If you have questions about how you should be paying your workers, or have any other questions regarding contractors or employees, please contact Peter van der Heijden at peter.vdh@crowehorwath.co.nz ; or your local Crowe Horwath advisor.

We’ve all seen, and been concerned about, the media talking about the number of liquidated businesses, including many in the trades. Inland Revenue has increased its debt collection activity, and that’s leading to more liquidations. This article, written by the Inland Revenue, gives some insight into the debt situation for those involved in building houses, and provides strategies to manage tax obligations effectively
The financial picture is sobering. According to Inland Revenue data, one in five businesses or contractors involved in building houses has overdue tax debt. The average amount of that debt is over $20k. In total, this is more than $280m in unpaid taxes –  a lot of which is PAYE and GST, which Inland Revenue has indicated they are focused on recovering.
Inland Revenue has also significantly increased its investigations and auditing; however, the department says its focus is on those who are actively trying to avoid their taxes – rather than the majority of builders who are trying to do things right.
More than 1,000 tip-offs received
Sometimes action is instigated due to tip-offs received. Inland Revenue has received more than 1,000 tip-offs about builders. These come from a range of sources, including:
Clients saying the builder wanted to be paid in cash, and they suspect it won’t be reported as income.
Ex-employees complaining about the use of cash to pay migrant labour under the table, while not paying PAYE (this is often identified when one of those employees needs proof of income, and Inland Revenue has no record of it).
A person who knows a lot about a builder, and how they spend their money – detailing holidays or large private expenses that don’t seem to match their income.
Poor record keeping often to blame
For the most part, when builders get in difficulty with debt, it’s often because the builder hasn’t kept up with their record keeping or when cashflow management has become a challenge. Inland Revenue understands provisional tax can be hard to get right sometimes, but if GST and PAYE isn’t being passed on, builders should consider seeking financial advice, as not paying PAYE is a criminal offence with some potentially severe consequences.
Inland Revenue has recently published some easy-to-understand advice on how people in the trades can stay out of trouble via ird.govt.nz/the-tax-toolbox.
How to deal with tax debt
If anyone is struggling to pay tax debts right now, Inland Revenue is willing to help. Options available include:
Setting up an instalment arrangement to pay the debt off over time – this can be done by going to your myIR account and selecting ‘Request an instalment arrangement’ under the ‘I want to …’ column.
If there’s no way a debt can be paid off, talk to your accountant as they may be able to negotiate something with Inland Revenue, or provide other options for managing the debt.
If you’re concerned about being able to meet tax obligations, the key is to act early rather than hoping the problem will resolve itself when things get better. Inland Revenue is willing to work with businesses that engage proactively about their situation. So, if you do find yourself in difficulty, the key is that the sooner you reach out – whether directly or through your accountant – the more options will likely be available.

For many of us, 31 March is the end of the financial year. Often it sneaks up quickly, leaving you with a lot of work to do. But, if you take the right steps, you could save yourself a good amount of time, stress and pain
A s one of life’s great constants, tax needs to be on a business owner’s mind year-round. The end of the financial year is no exception. Tax payments due in the two months following 31 March include:
Terminal tax for the previous year on 7 April (for taxpayers who have got time extensions through their accountants).
The third provisional tax payment.
GST for the period ending March 2016 both due on 7 May.
It’s crucial that you have a good handle on how your business has gone in the financial year. This provides the perfect opportunity to speak to your accountant about the issue of tax – in particular, whether you have paid enough.
As the IRD charges companies 9.21% interest on terminal tax amounts higher than $2,500, it’s critical to ensure that you have paid enough tax before it’s too late. For those operating as sole traders, or in partnerships in their first year of trading, a voluntary tax payment before 31 March can provide a much-needed discount on any terminal tax payment that may be due.
Avoid Penalties
The IRD charges penalties and interest for any non-payments on provisional tax dates, where they deem payments should have been made. Therefore, even if you pay the full amount of provisional tax on 7 May that you should have paid during the year, the IRD will still charge non-payment penalties and use-of-money interest.
A way to avoid this is through a Tax Pooling system, where you ‘purchase’ your tax at a lower interest rate in order to avoid these penalties. This is something you should discuss with your accountant, particularly if you operate in a seasonal industry, or if you have won contracts that have significantly increased your bottom line during the financial year.
Unpaid Invoices
Have you been having problems with collecting payments from some of your debtors during the year ? If so, a quick review of your debtor ledger to assess how straightforward the debt recovery process will be is an important part of the year-end pro cess.
The IRD allows for tax deductions of uncollectible amounts – or ‘bad debts’ – only if they are removed from your debtor ledger before the end of the financial year. These removals may be reversed if the debt is in fact collected unexpectedly later; however, these recoveries need to be included as fully assessable income for tax purposes.
Tools and Fixed Assets
Does your fixed asset schedule include any tools that are broken, obsolete, have been replaced or stolen during the period ? If so, these should be removed from your fixed asset schedule, for which a tax deduction amounting to the written down value (cost less accumulated depreciation) can be claime d.
Bonuses and Holiday Pay
Have you paid, or do you plan to pay, any bonuses for the 2016 financial year ? Employee benefits such as holiday pay and bonuses owing at 31 March can be claimed for tax purposes, if paid by 2 June (within 63 days of balance date). Bonuses must be finalised before 31 March in order to be claimed.Bonuses dependent on conditions satisfied after this date cannot be claimed.
While we’ve provided a number of areas to consider, there are many other areas that business owners need to focus on in the run-in to year-end. Balance date can approach very quickly, but by taking a step back from the tools and looking at the numbers, you can save yourself a lot of time and money.
If you do have questions about the end of the financial year, please contact Peter van der Heijden at peter.vdh@crowehorwath.co.nz ; or contact your local Crowe Horwath advisor.

Summer is always one of the busiest times of the year for those involved in the construction industry. While you work hard to make hay while the sun shines, it’s important to ensure you and your staff are aware of the hazards presented by working in hot, sunny conditions
S ummer is a great time for building and landscaping work, but it can present additional health and safety risks. We’ve put together some tips below on what you and your team can do to look after each other while working in warmer weather.
Make sure you know the danger signs to look out for when working in the heat. If you or one of your colleagues overheat, you’ll notice symptoms such as:
Clammy or sweaty skin.
Feeling weak or dizzy.
Darker coloured urine.
Pounding or rapid pulse.
Loss of balance / fainting.
Headaches.
Muscle cramps.
Mood changes or confusion.
If heat stress or exhaustion is not dealt with quickly, it can progress to heat stroke. At its worst, this can be life threatening. Be extra careful when doing the type of work listed below, which increase your chances of suffering from heat exhaustion:
Working in confined spaces.
Doing underfloor, ceiling or roof work.
In cabs of mobile plant.
Enclosed areas with limited air flow.
Slip, slop, slap!
It’s important to always protect yourself from the effects of heat and UV by wearing sunscreen, drinking plenty of water, taking breaks and seeking shade.
The risks of sun exposure may seem obvious, but it’s an easy one to overlook and can be fatal given New Zealand’s high rates of skin cancer.
Even though it’s great to enjoy the sunshine while on site, make sure you and your team follow basic sun-smart rules such as covering up with work clothes made of breathable fabrics, wearing a hat and using a good-quality sunblock.
Safety sunglasses, to protect eyes from flying objects and UV rays are also a good idea. With any sunglasses, always check the impact and UV rating.
Stay hydrated!
Your body overheats when it can’t cool itself through sweat, and sweat requires you to stay hydrated. Anyone building or landscaping in the heat of a summer’s day is at risk of dehydration.
This could be due to working in the direct sun, working near heat-producing processes or simply from the work you are doing (whether indoors or outside).
The effects of working in heat range from mild discomfort through to life-threatening heatstroke. With that in mind, consider:
Planning ahead
Try to avoid or limit prolonged exposure to extreme heat, and work in the shade when possible. Ensure there is adequate airflow or ventilation to help keep the temperature down.
Wear lightweight clothing if it’s safe to do so, but be sure to comply with your company’s clothing regulations.
Keep up the fluids
Most people need about eight glasses of water per day – but if you’re working in the heat, it’s likely you will need more. Make sure you and your crew drink plenty of water throughout the day and also limit the consumption of sugary or caffeinated drinks.
Fatigue
If you’ve been waiting for good weather to get cracking on a job, it can be tempting to push through and extend your working day. However, ignoring the signs of fatigue in yourself and your workers can be a real risk.
Consider:
Taking regular breaks – with extra breaks if the work is demanding.
Monitor and place limits around overtime and avoid incentives to work prolonged hours.
If you need to work longer hours, consider staggered start and finish times and longer breaks and periods off work.
Use the right tools and resources for the job.
Consider low-vibration hand-held tools and, where practical, install low-vibration seats in machinery.
Rotate tasks between workers.
Keep workloads and deadlines realistic.

Trade insurance expert Ben Rickard offers insights on recent insurance issues that have cropped up from builder and sub-contractors
We’ve been writing these articles since 2013 and have built up quite a library in that time. They can all be found on our website at builtin.co.nz/articles and the Under Construction website . We’ve covered pretty much any topic of insurance, risk, liability and potential claims that anyone working as a builder, LBP or other trade professional should have a good understanding of. Knowing what you are and aren’t covered for, and being aware of the risks you’re exposed to, are key to managing any business, and that applies equally if not more so to those in the construction industry. This time we cover off a few issues that have cropped up recently and are worth knowing about.
Contract works insurance covers subbies too!
Well, it should do. Regardless of who arranges it, generally sub-contractors can and usually are included under the policy. That means it doesn’t matter if it’s the builder, the owner or a subbie who damages the works – the contract works policy will cover it. Who pays the excess is then the only question, and if you have a good contract, it should set out the rules for this.
We have had three situations recently where subbies have been asked by their main contractor to pay for damage they’ve done to materials that are part of the job. One was a deck that had cedar oil spilled on it, another was for a smashed window in a new build and the third was damaged roofing iron. These should be covered under contract works insurance claims.
So, if you are a subbie and do cause some damage, be aware that the contract works insurance is there to cover you too! Because we are talking about damage to the works themselves, you may find that your liability insurance won’t cover it (this is complicated and depends on the specific circumstances of what is damaged and when) or will only apply over and above any contract works claim first.
The Building Defects exclusion
This is an exclusion in most construction and liability policies these days. It stemmed from the leaky homes crisis and effectively excludes any claim where water has penetrated a building through its external envelope. This sucks for trades who are working on this envelope, such as roofers, external waterproofers and those installing cladding. It has even been extended to deny claims from people who have accidentally penetrated existing structures while doing some small job, such as installing a heat pump, TV aerial or skylight.
Below is a typical Building Defects exclusion example:
We will not indemnify You for any claim under this Policy in respect of or alleging Personal Injury or Property Damage arising out of:
The failure or alleged failure of any building or structure to meet or conform to the requirements of the New Zealand Building Code contained in the First Schedule of the Building Regulations 1992 or any applicable New Zealand Standard (or amended or substituted Regulation or Standard) in relation to leaks, water penetration, weatherproofing, moisture, or any effective water exit or control system; or
Mould, fungi, mildew, rot, decay, gradual deterioration, microorganisms, bacteria, protozoa or any similar or like forms in any building or structure.
Unfortunately, insurers are unwilling to take on the risk of water penetration following the leaky homes crisis, so damage caused in this way is not insured. They take the view that any penetration that lets water in is a breach of E2, which triggers the exclusion.
Are you hiring equipment?
If you want to avoid having to pay the hire company’s insurance charges every time, you can arrange your own annual policy to cover hired equipment. This could add up to a reasonable saving, depending on the amount you spend on hireage each year and the value of the equipment.
While your liability insurance may cover you if you damage someone else’s property while using the hired kit (eg, you swing the bucket into the side of their house), it may not cover damage to or theft of the equipment itself. And, depending what your hire contract is, you could be liable for all sorts of things.
On another note, if you own your own stuff and are hiring it out to other businesses, you need to make sure that the insurance for that equipment allows ‘dry hire’, which means renting out a piece of equipment without an operator. Otherwise, it may not be covered if something happens while it’s hired out.
Cover for legal expenses
Most liability policies cover the legal costs related to a claim under that particular policy – ie, for defending the claim against you. For example, if you are sued for causing damage to someone’s house, and this damage is covered by public liability insurance, then that policy would cover the associated legal costs.
You can also get separate insurance for ‘legal prosecution defence costs’. This covers the cost of defending criminal prosecutions against directors or employees of the company while they were going about their work. It’s important to note that it relates to criminal prosecutions, such as an assault or theft charge, not civil claims such as breach of contract.
The legal costs cover described above is only for defending you, it’s not for you if you need to take someone to court yourself. There is insurance available that would pay your legal costs if you needed to bring a case against someone else, for example for breach of contract by a client. This cover is difficult to obtain but available in New Zealand in some circumstances. So, if this is of interest, please get in touch.
The information presented in this article is general in nature and not intended to be financial advice for individual situations. You should speak to an expert about your specific circumstances and needs. Builtin are New Zealand’s trade insurance experts.

The focus is on Canterbury’s employers to take responsibility for workers’ rights – especially for those more vulnerable, such as migrants.
The 2010 and 2011 earthquakes, which devastated Christchurch, resulted in 70% of the city’s buildings requiring demolition. Rebuilding Christchurch is the largest economic undertaking in New Zealand’s history, with thousands of additional workers required to get Christchurch back on its feet. Undoubtedly, for the region to fully recover, Canterbury has to be seen as an attractive place to live and work. Making sure workers are protected when it comes to their minimum employment rights is a vital part of that.
International evidence shows that rebuild operations too often result in underpaid and overworked employees. To minimise the risk of exploitation and injury, the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) has a wide-ranging programme of action under way to ensure that the rebuild goes smoothly and safely. This includes focussed work of the Labour Inspectorate, Health and Safety inspectors and Immigration New Zealand.
However, MBIE’s Labour Inspectorate regional manager Steve Watson says Canterbury employers and firms working on the rebuild need to take responsibility for what happens on the ground. He says they must play a lead role in protecting the reputation of their industries by highlighting and stamping out shabby employment practices, as these undermine Canterbury and New Zealand’s reputation as a great place to work and do business.
A strong example of business and government working together for the good of the region is The Canterbury Rebuild Safety Charter, established earlier this year and signed and endorsed by more than 55 organisations. The Charter is about making sure people come first in the rebuild and aims to see it completed as safely as possible. This includes protecting vulnerable workers and ensuring they are not at risk of exploitative labour practices.
Mr Watson says a lot of the workers in Canterbury are coming from outside New Zealand and may not be familiar with this country’s employment laws.
“The Labour Inspectorate recognises that the rebuild poses a risk of migrant exploitation. Migrant workers are a particularly vulnerable section of the workforce and are an increasing focus for the Ministry’s enforcement operations.
“The Labour Inspectorate is working with Immigration New Zealand to ensure migrant exploitation – such as paying less than the minimum wage or making people work excessive hours – does not occur in Canterbury.”
There are financial penalties for not complying with employment laws of up to $10,000 for individuals and $20,000 for companies. A person in breach of the Health and Safety Act may be subject to a conviction and to a fine up to $250,000.
A conviction for exploitation under the Immigration Act 2009 carries maximum penalties of seven years imprisonment, a $100,000 fine or both. In addition, a Bill introduced by the Minister of Immigration this month will make exploitative employers liable for deportation if they gained residence during the last ten years.
But enforcement is only one part of the solution. Government agencies are also making sure there is plenty of information available to employers and workers about their requirements and rights under the law. Immigration New Zealand has produced two new guides aimed at helping migrant workers in the construction sector to settle more quickly into work and employers to prepare for the kind of challenges migrants may face that could impact on their productivity.
Mr Watson says adjusting to New Zealand’s way of working may be a challenge for some migrant workers.
“Having a written employment agreement may be new to employees from other countries. It is important to provide migrant employees with an agreement, which clearly sets out employment conditions such as hours of work, rate of pay, holiday entitlements and any deductions from their wages. This will help reduce the risk of misunderstanding.
“Migrants should be encouraged to study their employment agreements before signing and to seek independent advice if they wish, with any changes to be agreed to in writing.”
Mr Watson says it’s also important for employers to have detailed signed employment agreements on file, as well as accurate time and wage records.
“Should there be any disputes in the future, or an employee is unclear about their entitlements, having up-to-date and concise records will make it easier for all parties to resolve the dispute.”
“International evidence shows that rebuild operations too often result in underpaid and overworked employees
For workers who feel they cannot resolve their concerns with their employers, including concerns about their health and safety, MBIE encourages them to make contact with the authorities, even if they’re worried about their immigration status. New policy introduced earlier this year means that in cases of serious workplace exploitation, migrants who come forward with genuine complaints will be allowed to remain in New Zealand while their cases are addressed.
“We know migrants may be apprehensive about speaking to authorities, but Immigration New Zealand and the Labour Inspectorate treat all employees fairly if a genuine complaint about exploitation at work is made.”
Mr Watson says it is essential that if people are concerned they are not receiving their minimum employment rights, or know of people in this situation, they phone the MBIE call centre on 0800 20 90 20.
Four weeks’ paid annual holidays at the end of each year of employment.
One ten-minute paid rest break for every four hours worked plus one unpaid 30-minute meal break when working more than four hours.
Employers must keep an accurate record of an employee’s time worked, payments, and holiday and leave entitlements.
Employers must keep a signed copy of the employment agreement.
Employees aged 16 years and over must be paid at least the adult minimum wage rate.
All practicable steps must be taken by employers and contractors to ensure employee safety.
Provision of personal protective equipment.

TITLE   : HOW A FOUR-DAY WEEK CAN WORK

Moving to a four-day week can bring tremendous benefits for businesses prepared to try something new
How many of these problems do you suffer from?
Can’t get good staff.
Not getting great responses to adverts.
Can’t come up with a compelling offer without pricing yourself out of the market.
What if you could solve these problems by offering prospective employees something they can’t refuse, while retaining your competitive place in the marketplace?
Maybe you can, thanks to four-day weeks.
How much of a difference would 40 days of additional paid holiday every year make to your recruitment efforts and staff satisfaction? Your employees would have more time to live their lives, more time to work on their own projects and more time to chill with their family.
Four-day weeks can provide your team with tremendous advantages. Sure, you need to gain buy-in to work 10-hour days (and it may not always work in winter) but the advantages are plentiful. Or if that is too much of a stretch, what about a nine-day fortnight with 20 days additional holiday?
Think any builders would be interested? I’m sure there would be some.
Advantages of a four-day work week
Reduced set-up time. Do a mental calculation on how much time is spent setting up and packing down each day. If you were to transition to a four-day working week, then you could reduce that setup time by 20%. This can add up to considerable savings over a year.
Less travel time. A four-day week reduces travel costs by 20%, which adds up to considerable savings over the year.
More catch-up time. Working a four-day week gives you an additional four days every month that you can draw on, if necessary, to catch up on a job that might have been held up.
More money. Some members of your team may wish to earn additional money by working extra hours. With some proper organisation, you may be able to find additional hours of work while still giving them a normal weekend. For example, you might use them to clear your small maintenance/repair jobs.
Happier clients. Some renovation clients may appreciate you not being on-site every day of the week, yet they still get their renovation completed in the same overall time.
Faster job turnaround. Alternatively, some clients may wish you to complete their job as fast as possible. With the pattern of 10-hour days, you may be able to stagger your team, so that you have team members on-site all five days.
Longer holidays. Some team members may be happy to work five x 10-hour days for several weeks on end (especially in good weather) and then have a longer break. For example, a full week and two weekends off after 3-4 weeks of work. Sure, it takes careful scheduling, but this would be attractive to some – especially to those that like to take long holidays.
Fresher team. A four-day week will probably appeal to active people, who like to stay fit and healthy – they may be (extreme) sportspeople who appreciate the additional time off to do their thing. Such active people |are usually fitter, more prepared to adapt to new ways of doing things and more able to cope with the rigours of building.
Increased management time. If you are the kind of person who needs to visit your sites every day, then moving to a four-day week can reduce your project management visits by 20%.
More client-focused time. Arranging client meetings during, or after, busy days is always a challenge. However, moving to a four-day working week allows you to schedule some (or all) meetings onto a meeting-focused day. Further, it also allows you to do your pricing during the day when you are fresher.
Moving to a four-day working week is not for everyone, and some team members wouldn’t be able to work 10-hour days. However, there may be some who are willing to give it a try.
This idea has been tried here and overseas, and in some cases has led to an increase in productivity without an increase in the number of hours worked each day; ie, the same amount of work has been achieved in 32 hours!
This may be a challenge in construction, but not an insurmountable one. Better people, better utilisation of resources, careful scheduling and goal setting may lead to higher productivity.
The main thing is to get the team involved. If they like the idea then get them to look for better ways to work, better utilisation of tools and equipment, better site planning and better management. It’s amazing how much creativity is released when a target is agreed upon. You may be surprised by the innovative ideas of your team if they enthusiastically embrace the possibility of working fewer days.
Implementation
Research and see what others have done.
Make a list of possible benefits of moving to a four day week.
Create a picture of what life could look like if you were to implement a four-day working week.
Share the idea with your team and explore some of the merits.
Work together to find workable solutions.
You probably won’t get it right the first time.

With recession in the headlines, the Successful Builder outlines how your business can buffer itself against the effects of a market downturn
For once, a number of economists are agreed that there is a downturn coming sometime soon. Not that they’re telling us precisely when, as that is impossible to predict.
From their perspective, recession is the time in the business cycle when weak and inefficient businesses disappear. These are the companies that pop up in periods of high demand, when they can charge high prices without necessarily delivering quality service. Or, if they do deliver quality service, they can afford to do so inefficiently. It’s often during a recession that these lower quality and less efficient businesses struggle or fail. The question is, is that a good thing?
One sure sign that a business is not ready to thrive in recession is the business owner reciting all the reasons his/her business is not doing well – can’t get good staff, market is slowing down, anti-business government decisions, challenging cash flow, unfair competition, customers not buying, etc. Heard any of this lately?
However, the reality is that, during a recession, there are still customers who want to build and renovate houses. The business environment feels different – customers often have more choice, working capital is usually harder to get, and prices likely need to be more competitive. On the other hand, staff are probably easier to come by and subcontractors more able to perform to schedule.
Yet many things stay the same – potential homeowners still contact a builder or a designer to start the process, concepts are discussed and working drawings produced, subcontractors are engaged, and agreements struck.
So, the key to thriving in a recession is owning a business that is functioning well in all areas – attracting enquiries, pricing competitively and building efficiently. In other words, owning a business that has a culture of doing all its parts well.
Power of personnel
Businesses alone don’t function well – people do. Or, as it is often said, “businesses don’t win – cultures do.”
To ensure you have a business that is functioning well and winning – no matter the market conditions – take a good look at your company culture and how your people behave.
1. Focus on what you can control
When you focus on strengthening the depth of your company’s culture, you are paying attention to the things that you can control, influence and change. You are not wasting your energy complaining about the things that you cannot change, because this results in powerlessness.
Whatever the market might be doing, when you focus on what you can do, your company is likely to grow stronger.
Furthermore, your team members are more likely to follow you when you are positive about your (and their) future, and more likely to join you in facing any challenges that may lie ahead. If you are overly negative about your company and its future, they may leave you to join someone who has more confidence. In fact, your negativity may become self-fulfilling!
So, are you focusing on improving your company’s culture?
2. Preserving the core values
It is difficult to build core values into your company without actually highlighting what those core values look like. Things like integrity, excellence, customer care, innovation, responsibility, commitment, etc. need to be defined by real life actions.
This is where a culture statement comes into play. Culture is defined as the ideas, customs, and behaviour of a particular group of people. Highlighting what these actions are and teaching them to your team is a sure way to get your culture ingrained into your company. This is reinforced when team members’ efforts that reflect the statement are celebrated.
Do you have a culture statement that highlights the everyday actions that reflect your core values?
3. People can’t be commoditised
While it is possible to purchase equipment and have it operational immediately, people are somewhat different. Each person comes with an individual background that may or may not fit easily into your team. They bring with them ways of behaving that may be different to what your team has been used to.
Their skills may be an excellent addition to the team, but unless they fit into your culture, they may not stay long. In fact, they may weaken your team. A strong team is always great but particularly when you might be facing a recession.
Markets can change rapidly, but building a culture takes time. Make sure that you are routinely and intentionally shaping your company’s culture.
Have you scheduled times and events to ensure this happens?
4. Performance arises from ‘who I am’ rather than from ‘what I do’
Many small businesses recruit on skillfit alone, with varied results. Careful business owners know that good performance comes from within the person – who that person is – as much as from what they can do. So they take time to ensure that a new recruit will fit into, or be amenable to growing into, the company’s culture. This way, the culture is preserved and strengthened.
How do you go about checking out a recruit before handing them a hammer? Could you have them come to smoko with your team to see how they fit in? Or go for a coffee with one or two of your team members?
Strength in depth
There is no doubt that market conditions will change in the months and years ahead. Having a strong cultural identity will give your company an internal stability that will assist it through these times with success.

TITLE   : FLEXIBILITY FACTORS

Following on from our Builders Business column, which highlighted the perks employers offer to keep good quality employees, we decided to look at different requests employees might make. This issue, we focus on flexible working arrangements
This information comes from a toolkit provided by Employment New Zealand, which is designed to help small-to-medium-sized business owners understand and manage flexible work with practical tips and tools.
Why flexibility is important
If you are a typical New Zealand business, you will know that finding the right workers with the right skills and keeping them in your business for the long term is very important.
For most of you as business owners, this is what will help you to grow and ensure that your customers get the service they deserve.
In New Zealand, the workforce is still growing, although at a slower rate than 20 years ago. This growth is being driven by a number of factors, including the large numbers of migrants who bring key skills into the country.
In all industries, whether you are employing younger workers entering the workforce for the first time, migrants who are new to New Zealand, women or older workers, workforce flexibility is an important consideration for workers across the spectrum, as they seek to juggle work/life priorities.
Some of the other factors driving the increasing demand for flexibility include:
The increase in the number of women entering the workforce (who are also primary caregivers).
Fathers in New Zealand becoming increasingly involved in the care of their children while still working.
The increase in one-parent families, three quarters of which are headed by women.
The growing number of dual-career couples, creating greater need to balance the home life efficiently.
The growth of caring responsibilities, which may include caring for children, the elderly, relatives in poor health or people with disabilities.
Our ageing population, which means an increasing number of older workers are choosing to remain in the workforce, but are looking for flexible options.
Financial considerations post Global Financial Crisis, which means that people are choosing to stay in the workforce for longer.
Advanced technology platforms, which allow greater numbers of employees to effectively work remotely.
Although many workers are attracted to workplace flexibility for different reasons, the common theme is that your business will need to respond to the growing demand for work/life balance if you would like to attract and keep the best workers.
Another factor driving the increase in requests for flexible work is a legislation change. The introduction of Flexible provisions of the Employment Relations Amendment Act 2014 provides workers with the right to a flexible work application process. The rights and obligations of employers are outlined below.
Flexible work is not a gender issue – it applies to all workers in all industries and organisations, whether large or small. Currently in New Zealand, more than one third of workers are in nonstandard work (self-employed, part-time or temporary) and, of those in permanent work, over 50% of workers have some sort of flexibility.
Different types of flexibility
Flexibility doesn’t just mean finishing early to pick up the kids. There are many options for flexible work and these usually include changes in where, how and when an employee conducts their work.
The most common options are listed below, but keep in mind that you can offer any one of these or a combination of several arrangements:
Working from home
We will not elaborate on this one, as it’s rarely an option in the construction industry; however, if you are able to apply this, ensure that you apply these policies consistently across your workforce to ensure fairness. (See Appendix C Working from home guidelines).
Flexi-time
This form of flexibility allows an employee to work a set number of hours per week or fortnight, which may be varied by agreement from week to week. Once again, the needs of the business must be considered and the arrangements should be documented in writing, so that there is no confusion about the details.
Part-time
Refers to an arrangement where an employee can work a set number of days and/or hours per month on a parttime basis, depending on their personal needs and requirements. The benefit of part-time work is that it is usually predictable and consistent, and this gives your other employees and your customers an opportunity to work in more effectively with the arrangement.
Condensed hours
This refers to an arrangement by which an employee can compress their set hours of work into a shorter work week, e.g. a 37.5-hour week could be averaged over four days at 9.38 hours per day. This arrangement may also be referred to as a compressed work week. Although less common, this form of flexibility ensures that your business has the same productivity from your employee, even though the hours are spread over a shorter time period to accommodate the worker’s personal requirements.
Job share
This form of flexibility is less popular as it is more difficult to manage. In certain circumstances, however, it can result in excellent outcomes for the employer as well as the workers who are job sharing. It refers to a form of part-time work, where two or more employees work part-time and share the responsibilities for one full-time role between them.
Rights and obligations
As an employer, you have a legal obligation under the Employment Relations Amendment Act (2014) (The Act) to provide a process for any employee to request a flexible working arrangement. This applies to any permanent full or part-time employee at any stage of their employment lifecycle and for any reason.
The Act gives you and your employees a process, which you can follow to consider the application and come to a decision. In considering the application, you should do so in good faith and genuinely think about how you might make the arrangement work for both you as the business owner and your employees.
This may require you to have a number of discussions with your employee. You may also need to involve other members of the team to come up with a suitable arrangement.
An employee has the right to apply for flexible work. It is important to understand that although The Act gives employees a process, it does not prescribe the outcome of an application. The key consideration in reviewing an application for flexible work is the impact the proposed arrangement will have on your business.
If through further discussion and negotiation with your employee, you are unable to come to a satisfactory arrangement, there are a number of grounds that you as a business owner can rely on to decline an application, such as:
It is not practical to distribute work among current employees.
You are unable to recruit additional employees (e.g, in the case of job share).
The arrangement may have a detrimental impact on quality or performance.
An insufficiency of work during the period the employee wishes to work.
Future plans for structural changes.
Additional burden or cost for the organisation.
The arrangement cannot easily be accommodated.
A potential detrimental effect on the ability to meet customer demands.
A potential detrimental effect on the ability to meet team demands.
All flexible work applications should be completed by the employee in writing and outline details about the request being made. Email is an acceptable way to apply and respond.
As an employer, you are required to respond to a flexible work application in writing within one month of receiving the application.
For more information on how this could benefit your company, and how to put it into practice, find the ‘Publications’ section on the employment.govt.nz website.

The Successful Builder coach offers tips for increasing your paycheck alongside your workload
I t’s that time of the year again when your end-of-year financial accounts reveal the real truth. Hopefully it’s a great report, but sometimes there can be unwelcome news about the year’s performance. You may have done heaps of business, as proved by the tax bill, but when it’s all tallied up, is there enough left over for you ?
If you’ve decided that this financial year needs to be different, then you may want to get onto making changes as soon as possible. So here are four things you might want to focus on to give yourself a better chance of doing well in the new financial year.
1. Aim for wallet share, not market share
Share of wallet is a marketing term referring to the amount of the customer’s total spending that a business captures in the products and services that it offers. Market share is a percentage of total sales volume in a market captured by a brand, product, or company.
There is a tendency among inexperienced builders to win a job no matter what, especially when it looks good – picture a high contract price, mouth-watering progress payments and the prestige of having your sign outside a big job in a good suburb. It tends to create the illusion that ‘if the jobs are big, and there is lots of money going through the bank account, then we must be doing OK’. Right ?
Wrong! Unfortunately, it is just not true. Business income does not equate to personal income.
I know of small businesses turning over more than $5m annually, yet paying their owners less than similar businesses doing a $2m turnover. You probably know some too. Why ? Because the successful business owner understands the difference between market share and wallet share and how to ensure the latter.
Most business consultants, coaches and accountants know that wallet share is closely connected to Gross Profit (GP) and Gross Profit percentage (GP%). Many (including me) will say that these two numbers are the most important in your business. Of course Net Profit (NP) is important too, but apart from GP it can only be increased by reducing your fixed expenses – and it’s not easy to make major changes to these without affecting your ability to run your business.
However, there are many ways to increase your GP. So this year, focus on checking your reporting systems to ensure you’re not compromising GP for turnover. Think of your wallet!
2. Improve your cashflow
Building businesses often suffer because of poor cashflow management. In sales, the business can be doing really well with large contracts and good profit margins. However, without the money to pay your team, subbies and suppliers, those contracts are worthless. You need to be able to fund your operations.
Cashflow problems are often caused by clients not paying on time – either because the job is delayed or, sometimes, because the client can’t (or won’t) pay for one reason or another.
So this year, review your contract payment terms, the spacing between progress payments and the size and timing of your deposits.
Make sure that you will always have enough money in the bank to cover your operational expenses in the event a client can’t make a progress payment.
Sometimes it’s those one-off payments such as holiday pays, insurances, taxes or similar that cause the problem. If this is the case, consider setting up a separate bank account to fund these one-off payments.
Then, on a monthly basis, pay enough into this account so you can pay your one-offs as they come up. You might even pay in a little more and build an emergency fund. That way, if someone can’t make a monthly payment, you can take action immediately.
If you are uncertain about how to do this, seek some advice. It’s very unfortunate when an otherwise great building company goes under because cashflow issues were overlooked.
3. Mark up for margin
Margin is the difference between a product or service’s selling price and its cost of production. Mark up is the ratio between the cost of a good or service and its selling price. It is expressed as a percentage over the cost.
In my opinion, there is a mathematical test that a builder should score 100% in before quoting any job.
The test should be in the calculation of margin and markup. I have seen too many cases where builders believe they have quoted a 25% margin, but then discover that they have actually quoted a 20% margin. Unfortunately, this is often realised after the contract is signed!
Now, 5% might not sound like much but, when you consider that overall a building business might return just 8% net profit, then a loss of 5% equates to a loss of 62.5% of the net profit – almost two-thirds!
So it’s worth the effort to get your head around margins and markups. If you are uncertain, get someone to check your calculations before you provide a contract!
The table below shows you the percentage of markup you will need to apply to your costs to achieve a desired Gross Margin percentage.
4. Value your service
You are a qualified builder, an entrepreneurial business owner, a professional advisor and you handle your clients’ largest assets.
Few of your non-building peers handle contracts anywhere near the size of those that you do.
Moreover, if you are the main contractor on the build, you are likely the first port of call should anything go wrong during the project or in the guarantee period, and even if the issue is caused by others, you will handle it. That’s a lot of responsibility.
So give yourself a break this year and don’t underestimate the value of your service.
Remember!
Take a moment or two right now to think about the suggestions above. Even if you can only manage to follow through on one, it can make a world of difference.

If the worst were to happen and you were forced out of work by an unforeseen illness, ACC wouldn’t cover your lost wages – so what are the alternatives?
I f you think being unable to work for an extended period of time is the fate of only a few unfortunate souls, then the following statistics should help you understand why it’s important to take the potential threat of illness seriously:
Four out of ten Kiwi men will be off work for at least six months at some time in their life. 1
90% of disability is due to an illness rather than an accident. 2
ACC only covers accidents, not illnesses.
If the only cover you have is through compulsory ACC levies, forced time off work as the result of an illness could put you and your family at financial risk.
Ministry of Health data shows that:
For 25-44 year old males: 25% of health loss will be from mental disorders, such as anxiety or depression (compared to 15% from injury). 3
For 45-64 year olds: 24% of health loss will be from cancer and 16% from vascular disorders (eg, heart disease and stroke), with injury representing less than 10%. 3
Given these numbers, it’s clear that ACC just doesn’t cut it when it comes to covering the problems that are most likely to keep you off work.
The simple solution
If you’re self-employed and already paying ACC levies, the good news is that it’s simple and inexpensive to broaden your cover to include illness.
That solution is switching to ACC Cover Plus Extra, in combination with private loss of earnings (income protection) insurance.
A typical example
Mike, a 40-year-old builder earning $80,000, pays around $67 per week in ACC levies. If an accidental injury forced him to take time off, he would receive $1,230 per week in compensation.
If Mike optimised his ACC with Cover Plus Extra and private loss of earnings insurance, he would be covered for accidents and illnesses for between $1,150 and $1,270 per week (depending on the reason for the claim).
He would pay around $66 per week for cover that would last for five years, or $86 per week for cover that would last until he turns 65. Given that 91% of claimants are back to work within five years, depending on age, the five-year benefit option works for most people.
If someone else pays your ACC levies, don’t worry. You can still arrange loss-of-earnings insurance to guarantee your income if you’re off work through illness.
To work out what’s best for you and your family, we recommend speaking to a financial adviser who specialises in this area. They will talk with you about your individual circumstances and recommend a solution that best meets your needs.
In a nutshell
If the only protection you have from loss of income is ACC, you could be at substantial risk from disability through illness.
The right package won’t cost you much more than what you’re already paying in levies and will ensure you’re better protected in case of illness.
It might not seem like the biggest priority right now, but for you and your family’s peace of mind, it’s worth getting sorted.

After you’ve worked hard on building your business from the ground up, it’s understandable that at some point you’ll want to move on and be rewarded for your efforts – but how do you ensure you get most bang for your buck?
C ommon reasons for builders wanting to sell their businesses include the desire for a lifestyle change, taking the opportunity to begin another venture, accessing the equity they’ve built up over time or simply wanting a rest. Whatever your reason, you’ll want your exit to be profitable and with as few problems as possible.
This month, we look at three common ways a business can be exited and introduce you to a fourth way newly introduced into NZ.
1) Sell to another company
Selling to a large company or a corporate offers up less risk the sale will fall through.
It’s a fair enough arrangement and, in many cases, achieves a good result.Often an amount is paid on signing, followed by a second amount subject to an ‘earn out’ arrangement. This second amount will only be paid if certain agreed financial targets are met and requires the previous owner to continue to work in the business through a transition period.
But there can be some fishhooks to avoid, including:
Losing control of the chequebook – expenditures you would have made in the past will now have to be approved. If the person approving doesn’t understand your company and the people involved, your spending decisions may be vetoed or delayed and opportunities to achieve your target lost.
Having your advice ignored – if your advice is not accepted, then it can be even harder to ensure that the company reaches the target. In the worst case, an ambitious corporate manager may even act contrary to your advice until after you have exited. Then, once you have departed, apply your ideas and gain all the accolades!
Not benefiting from future earnings – the purchase price of your company is usually calculated on past performance rather than on future earnings. Yet the best years may be ahead, especially if the buyer brings additional resources. If you believe your best years are ahead, make sure you negotiate an additional amount for exceeding target.
2) Sell to another person
You list with a business broker, find a suitable buyer, negotiate a price and the sale takes place – usually with an ‘earn out’ arrangement. Fishhooks to avoid with this method include:
Your customers may not like the new owner – it’s likely you have kept the possible sale of your company confidential, so your customers don’t get the jitters. Now, imagine if your customers decide not to continue to do business with the new owner – how will the company fund the ‘earn out’ if your customer base evaporates ? Consider retaining veto over changes that may affect customer relationships until you are fully paid out.
No benefit from exceeding the target – if the new owner brings new ideas and the company earns way more than expected during the ‘earn out’ period, the new owner is happy, but you may feel cheated given that you contributed to the additional earnings. Ensure that the agreed ‘earn out’ amount includes a bonus should the company perform above expectations. Also, make sure that the new owner can’t hold back on any sales until after the ‘earn out’ date is past.
3) Sell to an employee
Maybe you have an employee who has asked about taking a shareholding.
Certainly many small business owners have exited their business by gradually selling off shares to an existing staff member.
It sounds like a smooth transition and is a great arrangement for your customers. As far as they are concerned, it’s business as usual.
Many small business owners have exited their businesses successfully in this manner.
However, even here there are fishhooks to look out for:
You lose control before you have all your money out. Once you have transferred more than half your shares, you no longer have full control of your company and no guarantee of the business’s ability to pay you the balance of the purchase price. Should the business decline (and the value of your shares with it) then you may be left with less than you hoped for. Before you become a minor shareholder, ensure your purchaser has the ability to complete the sale.
Dividends – should you sell a majority of shares, then you will want your remaining shares to continue to yield dividends. However, the new owner determines what the dividend is and may reinvest or increase fixed expenses, reducing the amount to be paid. If it’s your intention to retain shares and gain annual dividends, then you need a rock-solid agreement to ensure they’re protected.
4) A new alternative – sell to an agglomerated publicly listed company
An agglomeration is a group of SMEs collected into an industry-specific, publicly listed global company.
In an agglomeration ‘sale’, you trade your company shares for shares in a global publicly listed industry specific company (PLC) – made up of dozens of small businesses spread around the world – all engaged in various parts of that industry. You remain as CEO (for as long as you wish) and your company retains its identity, but benefits from all the resources a PLC can bring.
For example, you connect with some of the brightest entrepreneurs in the industry and get help to improve your business.
Further, you get access to larger clients not accessible to small businesses and opportunities to expand your business by strategic purchases. You also have the opportunity to release your capital as and when you need it.
However, while an agglomeration sale avoids many of the normal fishhooks and is likely to achieve a better sale price more quickly, it’s a new take on the traditional corporate sale and does not have a long history. It’s worth keeping an eye on this as it takes hold in NZ. You can learn more at www.agglomeratebiz.com

We’re living in a constant state of flux, but the people at the heart of it remain the same. Business coach Graeme Owen says this can be used to inform solid business practice
W hile the last two years have heralded many changes — some drastic — in many ways nothing has changed.
“What ? !” I hear you ask. “Where have you been the past two years ? Everything’s changed! Interest rates. Inflation. Material supplies. Workers. Costs. Nothing is the same!”
Consider for a moment the following:
People still live in homes that do not meet the needs of their family
Their home may be too small for their growing family and may be putting pressure on relationships – perhaps they need to extend the house ?
Maybe the home is cluttered, badly designed and needs an internal rearrangement to make it work better. There may be many un-usable spaces or unnecessary internal walls, or the house is cold, drafty, and needs insulating or new joinery. It may be tired, worn and in need of a complete makeover.
Covid-19 means people are spending more time in their houses, and becoming more and more aware of its limitations. Their dissatisfaction may be growing.
Remember, people still want to change their house – and they need you to do it for them.
People still want to know how to go about doing a renovation
For most people, a renovation is something they have never done before – and they will have plenty of questions. Common queries include:
Where do I start ?
How do I choose a builder/designer ?
Should I renovate or would it be better to move ?
How about staying and building a new house on my site ?
Should I capitalise on the land value and build multiple units ?
Who better to help them with these initial questions than you! Sure, you may not be the expert in every area, but you are the one professional who knows who to contact for answers to almost any question they may have.
People still want to build or purchase a new home
Whatever the commercial environment, people are still looking to build or purchase a new home. They may be retiring and downsizing, or ready to create their dream family home. They may be just starting out and looking for their first home. There is always movement in the new house market and tastes will change, but the need for new houses will remain.
People still want to get good value for their investment
People always want the price paid to match the value received. When a prospective customer says that price is not an issue, what they are really saying is that they’re prepared to pay good money but they expect top quality results. They are NOT saying that they will pay top money for mediocre workmanship!
In a changing environment, you still need to demonstrate that your prices are commensurate with the value they are expecting — whatever level of value that is. That hasn’t changed.
People still want someone who will help and advise them
Probably more so now than previously — given all the changes in the building environment. With that in mind, you need to become their professional building advisor, rather than just another builder wanting to get paid.
This all circles back to the idea that people are much the same today as they were two years ago. There’s plenty of work to be done and business to be earned!
TOP TIPS FOR 2022
That said, here are five things you can do in the coming year to ensure your business stays in good health during 2022.
1.Keep your head Stay positive. You’ve faced change before. You can do it again. Sure, the changes may be larger than last time, but you can do it.
If this is the first time you have faced big changes in the economy, talk to those who have survived several cycles of change to find out what helped them.
2.Keep informed Talk to your suppliers and subbies. Listen to what they are expecting. Then, rather than complaining about rising prices and uncertain schedules, plan for how you will stay in business with rising prices and uncertain schedules. It’s the same environment for everyone.
3.Keep short accounts Watch for all price increases and ensure you pass these on. Be careful with fixed price contracts and make sure that they allow for price increases. Prepare your clients for the likely finished price rather than today’s price and, if possible, purchase critical materials in advance.
4.Continue looking for new team members In times like these, builders move around, so keep advertising for staff, even if you don’t need them right now. Your current staff may join the exodus, and you could end up needing new people in a hurry!
5. Stay focusing on your preferred target market If there is still a market for your specialty, then stick with it—but make sure that you learn how changes are influencing your target clients and the questions they’re likely to be asking. Then continue to post answers to these questions. Stay relevant.
Takeaway
Change might be the only constant (Heraclitius 500BC), but people are still the same!

Setting up a business on your own can be daunting. To ensure you start off on the right foot, head in the right direction, and reach your goals, it’s crucial you have the right structure in place
Making even a minor error when setting up a company can have big implications later on. There are a number of things to consider when creating your business plan.
Will you operate as a sole trader, in partnership, or as a limited liability company?
Should you set up a trust to protect your personal assets?
While these decisions may seem simple, whatever you choose can impact on your ability to grow, sell or even shut down the business. Furthermore, there are a myriad of tax laws pertaining to each structure.
Once you’re operational, your first ambition will be to make money. However, generating income isn’t as straightforward as just doing the work, sending out an invoice and moving on. They say ‘cash is king’, and a business without cash can be sure of a very short life.
A strong accounting system is a great asset to ensure you get paid. It’s a lot easier to keep track of invoices on a computerised system, rather than keeping pieces of paper under the seat of your ute!
If the worst happens and you struggle to collect payment, it’s important to understand a key piece of law – the Construction Contracts Act. Knowing your rights under law can be a key ally if it does come to the crunch, in terms of being paid.
Once you’ve been paid, you will want to hang on to as much of that money as possible. After all, you got into business to make money for yourself, not for someone else.
Excluding the payment of expenses, there are many ways through which you can be parted from your hard-earned cash. In fact, while not often considered a threat, this is one of the riskiest areas for a business.
Contract disputes, insurance and ACC claims – often arising from not having contracts or insurance in place – can be extremely damaging to a business. If a decent reserve of funds isn’t built up, a business can disappear very quickly. For example, how prepared is your business for dealing with the upcoming change to health and safety legislation?
Having the right type of insurance and contracts in place can be the difference between success and failure. Due to the complexity of these areas, we recommend you consult an expert in these fields.
“Having a growth plan will enable you to know when you can get off the tools, afford to employ others, acquire another business or even sell to someone else
Have you considered what you’re going to do when you’re unable to get on the tools each day? It might be a scary thought, but it’s important to have an end in sight even as you begin. For this reason, having a plan to grow your money is the final ingredient to your business’ success.
Do you want to build an empire of companies, with an eye on becoming the next big player in the market? Are you happy to be a subcontractor and leave the headaches to someone else, or do you want to be somewhere in between?
Wherever you want to be, you’re going to need more cash than you started out with. Having a plan for how to grow your money is incredibly important.
As we all know, a good building isn’t built without a robust set of plans – so why would your business be any different?
Having a growth plan will enable you to know when you can get off the tools, afford to employ others, acquire another business or even sell to someone else.
While the above is a snapshot of what’s important to a business, there’s a lot more to understand. With that in mind, Crowe Horwath has teamed up with Minter Ellison Rudd Watts to provide a free comprehensive afternoon training session to cover off these areas in more detail, and give you and your business the key tools it needs for success. The sessions begin in late April 2015 and will be running in different locations around the country. For further information or expressions of interest, please contact us at Auckland@crowehorwath.co.nz .
If you have questions about any of the topics raised in this article, in particular around risk management or any other financial matters; or you would like to attend the free training session in your area, please contact Peter van der Heijden at peter.vdh@crowehorwath.co.nz ; or your local Crowe Horwath advisor.

TITLE   : Stay on track with a dashboard

If your pipeline of work is running out and you’re close to hitting the panic button, a dashboard might be just what you need to help you sleep easy at night
Recently, one of my clients went through a prolonged period with no major sales. It was a rather alarming situation. Where others may have panicked or reacted in a knee-jerk fashion, he didn’t. Instead, he stuck to his marketing and sales process.
Six months later, he signed up several large jobs worth more than three million dollars – all in the course of a few days!
What was it that gave him such confidence to persist? It was the dashboard he had set up some time earlier.
What’s a dashboard?
A dashboard is a set of numbers and/or ratios that reflect the state of a business at any point in time. It may be you measure the number of hours invoiced each month, then compare that against the number of hours worked, giving an indication of labour efficiency.
When numbers for one period are compared with the numbers from a previous period (eg, month on month), it is possible to identify trends within your business and how you can change these for a positive outcome.
How it helped
The dashboard allowed him to monitor the overall health of his business, which showed it was actually tracking well. He had enough work to keep his team busy, so he had no need to panic and, barring an external national or international catastrophe, his business was in good shape.
Rather than being concerned by the lack of sales, he was able to keep his emotions in check by assessing all the activities that lead to sales.
If you don’t have a dashboard for your business and would like to set one up, here are some things to consider.
Identify your key activities
Decide on three to five key activities that have the most influence on the profit line of your business, then measure them regularly and consistently – and do it for a long time.
Track these activities for long enough to be able to clearly see how their outcomes are affected by any changes you make.
For example, another client of mine changed his Google AdWords based on the results of a market survey he conducted. Within just one week, the number of phone calls his company received increased fivefold.
Had he not been keeping careful records of changes and results, he may have missed the connection between the changes to the AdWords and the spike in calls. Now he can test other changes to his marketing strategies.
In building, there are several key indicators you could include in your dashboard:
The number of enquiries you receive (and a means of measuring how many of these are turned into sales).
The channels your enquiries are generated through.
Operational gross profit as a percentage of income.
Work in progress (the amount of work sold, but not yet built).
The rate of change of the above.
Delegate daily tasks
Keeping careful records is something many business owners neglect. Sometimes, it’s just not in their personality profile – they would rather get out there and make things happen.
If this is you, then it may be in your best interests to delegate the keeping of records to an assistant.
Love the detail
Dashboarding gives you the ability to make small changes to your business and then assess the effects. It also gives you the ability to test a strategy before committing large amounts of resource to it.
Most actions by themselves may only have a small impact on profitability, but the cumulative effect can be devastating, or exciting. Being able to read these small changes early gives you time to take the necessary actions to prevent bad results or, on the other hand, to increase investment in those activities that yield good results.
You can’t rely solely on your annual accounts to give you useful management information, because they only provide you with a retrospective view of your business. Careful dashboarding gives you objective information on your company’s performance in real time.
Another client of mine was sure his business was going backwards, as there was almost no money in the bank! However, his dashboard revealed this was caused by actions (or lack of) several months back and that he was now tracking out of the hole. Once again, good dashboarding prevented knee-jerk decision-making.
Steer clear of emotions
It’s easy to get enthusiastic when things look as though they are going well, and conversely be pessimistic when it looks as though they are not. This can lead to poorly thought-out and hasty interventions. Dashboarding enables you to put your emotions aside and act logically.
Long-term success comes when you keep doing the right things – for a long time. It’s when we feel things are going bad that we make poor decisions.

There is no doubt that migrant workers are required to help fill labour and skill shortages, but it can take time for businesses to maximise the skills they bring. Judi Altinkaya, Immigration New Zealand’s National Manager for Settlement, says that employers can benefit from some simple tips that can make all the difference to settling and retaining migrant workers in their workplaces.
To help employers and their Kiwi employees recruit and better integrate migrants into their workplaces, Immigration New Zealand has created the helpful guide Are You Employing Migrant Construction Workers?
Over the next few issues of Under Construction, we’ll be featuring content from this guide so that when you encounter issues, you’ll have a better idea of how to deal with them. Remember, understanding the challenges migrants face may help you help them increase their productivity.
While employing migrant workers can be a great asset to your business, it’s important to consider a few things before jumping into it.
Many migrant workers are here on a temporary visa and may only be here for a limited amount of time.
Migrants may be used to different employer-worker relationships from what we have in New Zealand. To get the best from them, your style of managing them might need to change slightly from how you manage a New Zealand employee.
Migrants may have limited, or no, experience of working in New Zealand’s construction industry and they might need a bit of extra training – our tools, the words we use and the way things are done may be new to them.
English might not be their first language, so you may need to take more time when telling them how things are done.
Migrants come from different cultures and often value different things from Kiwis.
There are a number of immigration visa options for migrant workers, depending on their occupation and your offer of employment. Which of the following is best for your business needs?
Work to Residence: Allows a migrant to work in New Zealand. After working in the job for at least 24 months, they can then apply for a resident visa.
Work Visa: Allows a migrant who works in a profession that is experiencing skill shortages, or has a job offer from an accredited employer, to live and work in New Zealand for a set period time.
Resident Visa: Allows a migrant to live and work in New Zealand indefinitely and access most public funded services. Most resident visas are granted through the Skilled Migrant Category – a points system based on factors such as age, work experience, qualifications, and an offer of skilled employment.
Approval in Principle: If you have job vacancies and can’t find suitable New Zealanders to fill them, you can apply to INZ for an Approval in Principle to bring in migrant workers.
“While employing migrant workers can be a great asset to your business, it’s important to consider a few things before jumping into it
There are some online sites to help employers locate skilled migrants.
New Kiwis is a free national employment service provided by the Auckland Chamber of Commerce. It connects overseas and local migrant job seekers with New Zealand Employers. www.newkiwis.co.nz
SkillFinder is a free service provided by Immigration New Zealand to help employers with vacant, permanent positions that they are unable to fill locally. SkillFinder connects employers with Immigration New Zealand’s database. www.immigration.govt.nz/employers/skillfinder
The Canterbury Skills and Employment Hub is a free job-matching service, where an employer can register vacancies which are then matched against a database of job seekers to find the best fit for your needs. The Hub aims to ensure that firms can easily get the staff they need locally – and, where that’s not possible, there’s a streamlined process to help them access offshore migrants to meet their needs.
Migrants to New Zealand have the same rights and obligations under New Zealand law as any other person living here, but it is particularly important that newcomers obey the law.
Breaking the law can put your new employee’s visa status, and their family’s status, at risk. Immigration New Zealand can require non-citizens to leave New Zealand if they consider the offence calls into question the migrant’s good character. This can include any criminal offending (such as driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs) and may apply to migrants with permanent residence visas as well as temporary workers, regardless of the reason for their stay, or the needs of the employer.
Under the Immigration Advisers Licensing Act 2007, immigration advice can only be provided by licenced immigration advisers or exempt persons. The Act distinguishes between the provision of advice (which is restricted to licensed immigration advisers and exempt persons) and the provision of publicly available information.
Passing publicly available information to a migrant employee, or prospective migrant employee, that they could have obtained for themselves is not considered to be providing “immigration advice”. Adding your knowledge of, or personal experience in immigration, to advise, assist or direct someone is providing “immigration advice”.
When employing migrants, whether or not English is their first language, it’s important to remember that they may not understand the terms or expressions we use. One employer said he told a migrant worker to “keep an eye on them” referring to some labourers. However, while the migrant worker did just that, and afterwards let the employer know what hadn’t been done correctly, he didn’t realise that meant that he should speak up if they were doing something wrong during the process.

During economic downturns, builders can find inspiration from all manner of places. Here, The Successful Builder coach Graeme Owen explains how to find inspiration in a Kiwi classic
Do you know any builder who doesn’t enjoy the sounds, smells and tastes of a great BBQ? Me neither! Recently, I wheeled out my own from its winter storage and started cleaning it for summer. As I went through the process of scrubbing and checking, I got to thinking how running a successful building business can feel a little like grilling the perfect steak – there’s no room for mistakes and every detail counts!
You wouldn’t throw a BBQ without a bit of preparation, would you? Just like throwing a successful BBQ, you shouldn’t run a business without ensuring all the essentials are in place and ready for use; especially if, like many other builders, you are facing a tough summer business environment.
So, let’s explore how maintaining your BBQ can mirror the steps needed to keep your business firing on all cylinders!
1. Keep your bbq clean: first impressions matter
Just as a clean BBQ creates the right impression for your guests and helps them relax and enjoy your cooking, a well-maintained business creates a positive first impression for clients and he’s them feel comfortable around you.
When a prospective client meets you for the first time, do they see a professional? If they walk onto your building site, is it clean and tidy? Do your vehicles, equipment and tools look well maintained? Does your team give a good first impression? In hard times, clients have more choice. They can afford to be more selective and are likely to choose those who present themselves well and stand out. The little things count.
So, take some time to clean up your business’ appearance. Check that your marketing materials are up to date and that your branding and advertising is consistent. Also, check that your sites and your team are looking tidy and professional. Make this a regular routine.
2. Check the gas: fuel your business with the right resources
Imagine the frustration of running out of gas midway through grilling.
Anyone for raw sausages? How embarrassing!
Similarly, running out of resources – whether it’s finances, materials, or skilled team members – can bring your business to an abrupt halt. In tough economic times, it’s absolutely vital that you ensure you have enough ‘fuel’ to keep your business running smoothly.
So, keep an even closer eye on your finances, ensuring that your cash flow is as steady as possible. If necessary, shorten the time between incurring costs and invoicing your clients. Keep short accounts where possible and ensure that your suppliers are reliable. Maintain good relationships with your subcontractors, remembering that they are also traversing the same economic environment.
3. Monitor the temperature: keep track of key business indicators
A BBQ thermometer helps you cook your food to perfection. In business, your financial dashboard helps you monitor your company’s health. Whether it’s tracking your income, costs, profit margins, client satisfaction, or project timelines, having reliable data at your fingertips is essential.
If you don’t have a dashboard for your business, set one up – now! Regularly review your key performance indicators, which can be as simple as total amount invoiced, total costs incurred, gross profit, overheads, cash in the bank, the number of marketing leads into the business, lead conversion rates, and the progress of each project. Do this on a weekly or monthly basis to stay on top of your game. Knowing your numbers is essential in tough times.
4. Check the lid: ensure your business retains momentum
A BBQ lid that doesn’t close properly means you can’t maintain the heat needed for cooking.
Similarly, a business that loses its momentum will struggle to stay competitive. In competitive times, you will need to work harder to gain new and retain existing clients, maintain team morale and preserve efficiency. If you are not getting as many enquiries, you need to put more effort into your marketing and advertising. However, make sure that you test any new methods before spending big.
Focusing on closing the gaps will help you retain what you already have. Providing an excellent service, while maintaining a motivated and efficient team, will help you retain your momentum.
5. Use a cover: protect your business assets
A BBQ cover protects your grill from the elements, extending its lifespan.
Similarly in business, protecting your physical and intellectual assets is key to gaining a long-term return from your efforts. This includes everything from safeguarding and securing your equipment and premises to safeguarding your business’ reputation.
A tough time may be exactly the right time to check your insurance cover, review your equipment maintenance schedules and check that your public communication is appropriate and relevant.
6. Test the burners and ignitor: ensure your business can fire up
Testing your burners and ignitor ensures you’re ready to cook when it’s time. In business, this means reviewing your processes and systems (marketing, sales, pricing, site, admin, legal, etc) and adapting them where necessary to the changing environment.
Ask yourself: ‘If I were starting from scratch again, would I do things differently?’ If you answered ‘yes’, now is the time to modify how you do things, so you’re better prepared to embrace the next economic upswing.
Running a building business in tough economic conditions is much like preparing the perfect BBQ – attention to detail, preparation and maintenance are key. By keeping your ‘BBQ’ in top shape, you can ensure your business is ready to handle whatever challenges come your way, serving up success even when the heat is on.

How many times have you advertised a vacancy and your inbox has been flooded with unsuitable applications? Or, conversely, you receive little interest from candidates at all? When it comes time to recruit your next permanent or contract team member, here are a few things to consider
If people with the skills you need are readily available in the candidate market, advertising should attract suitable applications for you to review, shortlist, and interview. However, this isn’t often the case for those looking to hire in New Zealand’s construction market, as there’s a well-documented shortage of certain skills. If demand exceeds supply for the skills you need, a simple job advertisement will likely produce few results.
Finding the right person
If that’s the case, how will you find the right person? Over the years, technology has seen recruitment strategies move from printed newspaper ads to online job boards and social platforms. All the while, the focus has been on identifying the best candidates from those looking for a job at that point in time.
The rapid evolution of technology has changed all that. In fact, technology moves so quickly that unless you regularly recruit, you may not have heard how recruiters are now integrating data science capabilities with the skills, expertise and relationships of people to engage the very best professionals, rather than being limited to the best of those who happen to be looking for a new job at the time.
How to find & engage
How does this work? Digital technology and data science analytics are now used to reach deep into potential candidate pools and examine large amounts of data to prepare shortlists of the most suitable people. The data points can then be combined to determine how the timing of a job opportunity fits with a potential candidate’s career journey, how the role is likely to fit with their aspirations, and how relevant an approach about the job will be. Based on this, recruiters engage with suitable potential candidates to understand their personal priorities and career aspirations.
But not every organisation has the resource, such as a company recruiter, or the systems to do this, which is why some decide to engage an external recruiter that has invested in technology to complement their work.
Whatever approach you decide to take, below are some tips for attracting the right employees:
Selling your job
When skills are in demand, employers need to communicate the benefits of working for them. Make sure your Employee Value Proposition clearly communicates your company’s values and culture, as well as the rewards, opportunities and experience of working for your company. By communicating what you stand for and the experience of working at your company, you’ll attract like-minded candidates who are a natural fit with your company and the way you do business.
Speed up your recruitment process
It’s also important to run a succinct recruitment process – otherwise you could miss out on your preferred candidate to a competitor who moves faster and makes an offer before you. Shortening your recruitment process means a candidate could undertake their first interview, a second interview with co-workers or senior managers, sit any technical tests and be offered a conditional role, all in a few hours. A more streamlined process also brings down costs.
Make a competitive offer
In some areas, salaries are increasing in response to demand, while in others they remain static. Regardless, be aware of current salary trends for the role you are recruiting by referring to a current salary guide, such as the Hays Salary Guide, and make a realistic offer that’s in line with the market.
Hotspots of skills in demand
The Hays Jobs Report highlights employment hotspots. The latest report, covering the first half of 2018, confirms high demand for commercial site managers and project managers, given the large number of commercial builds.
Commercial estimators are being sought too, as increased competition sees companies tender for more projects. Intermediate to senior commercial quantity surveyors are also in demand. Meanwhile, residential quantity surveyors will be required in response to the continued housing shortage and demand for new builds.
We’ll also see demand for quantity surveyors in sub-trades as projects enter the completion stage.

For builders who own businesses or are sole traders, the day doesn’t end when you down tools – there’s plenty of paperwork to attend to. Here’s some advice on tackling the larger than usual amount at the year’s end.
For many of us, 31 March is the end of the financial year. It can sneak up on you very quickly, leaving a lot of work to do before you can even consider sending your books to your accountant.
As with any time of year, there are many areas to cover off and consider, but by paying attention to the following areas, you can save yourself a good amount of time and, sometimes, money (not to mention impressing your accountant a great deal).
Tax is one of the great constants in life and needs to be on a business owners’ mind year round. The end of the financial year is no exception. With the multitude of tax payments due in the two months following 31 March  – terminal tax for the previous year on 7 April and the third provisional tax payment and GST for the period ending March 2014 both due on 7 May – it is crucial you have a good handle on how business has gone.
The end of the financial year provides the perfect opportunity to speak to your accountant about the issue of tax – in particular, whether you’ve paid enough.
As the IRD charges 8.40% interest on any terminal tax amounts higher than $2,500 for companies, it’s critical to ensure you’ve paid enough tax before it is too late. For those operating as a sole trader or partnership in your first year of trading, a voluntary tax payment before 31 March can provide you with a much-needed discount on any terminal tax payment that may be due.
As the IRD charges penalties and interest for any non payment on provisional tax dates, where they deem payments should have been made, you may also find yourself facing a difficult issue.
Even if you pay the full amount of provisional tax on 7 May that you should have paid during the year, the IRD will still charge non payment penalties and use of money interest.
“The end of the financial year provides the perfect opportunity to speak to your accountant about the issue of tax – in particular, whether you’ve paid enough
A way to avoid this is to use a Tax Pooling system and ‘purchase’ your tax at a lower rate of interest. This is definitely something you should discuss with your accountant, particularly if you operate in a seasonal industry, or if you’ve won contracts that have significantly increased your bottom line during the financial year.
Taxes aside, there are also several internal business issues that require your attention.
Have you been having problems collecting payments from some of your debtors during the year? If so, a quick review of your debtor ledger with a view to assessing the collectability of the debts is an important part of the year-end process.
The IRD allows for tax deductions of uncollectible amounts – or ‘bad debts’ – if they are removed from your debtor ledger before the end of the financial year. You cannot deduct a ‘provision’ for the removal in case they will be collected; these removals need to be absolutely final. These removals may be reversed if the debt is, in fact, collected unexpectedly at a later date; however, these need to be included as fully assessable income for tax purposes.
Does your fixed asset schedule include any tools that are broken, obsolete or have been replaced or stolen during the period? If so, these should be removed from your fixed asset schedule – for which, a tax deduction amounting to the written down value (cost less accumulated depreciation) can be claimed.
Too often, fixed asset schedules can be full of assets that are no longer used, meaning the business is denying itself the full tax deduction available – a quick review of the schedule can provide valuable tax savings for the business.
Have you or do you plan to pay any bonuses for the 2014 financial year? Employee benefits such as holiday pay and bonuses owing at 31 March can be claimed for tax purposes if paid by 2 June (within 63 days of balance date). Bonuses must be finalised before 31 March in order to be claimed. Bonuses dependent on conditions satisfied after 31 March cannot be claimed.
While we’ve provided a number of areas to consider, bear in mind that not all of these will apply to you specifically and there may be other matters that you will need to attend to. Balance date can approach very quickly, but by taking a step back from the tools and looking at the numbers, you can save yourself a lot of time and money.
If you do have questions about the end of the financial year, please contact Peter van der Heijden at peter.vdh@crowehorwath.co.nz; or contact your local Crowe Horwath advisor. For the contact details of your local office, please visit www.crowehorwath.co.nz

Did you come back from your break with that look in your eyes – the one that comes from having a new sense of direction after having the time to think about the long-term possibilities for your business? A few months in, have you now lost it, as the paperwork and bills started piling back up? Here’s how to maintain that feeling!
For many, the New Year is a time to review where they are at – whether it be in their personal, family or business lives.
Many set new goals and tell themselves (and others) that this year is going to be a good year. Then February comes, followed by March, and life gets busy again. The phone rings, emails start flowing in, and before you know it, you’re swamped by endless paperwork and bills that need to be paid.
All of a sudden, you’re wondering, ‘where did my January fizz go?’ People find themselves giving up on their goals.
Don’t get disheartened
If this is you, don’t worry, it’s quite normal! According to a Forbes report, only 8% of those who make New Year resolutions actually achieve them, yet way more than 8% of businesses do well.
So, how do busy people go about being effective in setting and achieving goals?
Keep them S.M.A.R.T
You’ve likely heard this well-known acronym before when talking about goals, it stands for:
• Specific. • Measurable. • Actionable. • Realistic. • Time bound.
Specific
The statement ‘I want to get more building jobs’ may indicate a new vision for your company, or it could just be a desperate hope.
A specific goal – such as, ‘to increase the number of building jobs, I will convert more of our renovation leads into sales’ – provides more clarity and direction to you and to your team.
Measureable
When you add quantities, you are making a goal about an outcome that can be measured. You’ll know exactly when it has been achieved, whereas without a measurable indicator, you won’t be able to tell.
If your goal is to earn more this year,  then your success or failure is entirely dependent on your definition of more.
Continuing with the above example, you could restate your goal as: ‘To increase the number of building jobs, I will convert 75% more of our renovation leads into sales.’
Actionable.
A S.M.A.R.T goal should reference the actions that need to be taken in order for it to be achieved. Amending our example above further, you may say:
‘To increase the number of building jobs, I will create and implement a sales plan that will allow us to convert 75% more of our renovation leads into sales.’
Realistic
Goals should stretch you and require you to develop in some areas, but they also need to stay within the bounds of common sense.
Being S.M.A.R.T is learning to step just outside your comfort zone, so you’ll be excited about the results. In our example, increasing your conversion rate by 75% sounds good – but is it possible?
It may be if you intend to access some proven tools, but may not be if you have no new strategies to implement. Your goal may now look like this:
‘By accessing XYZ training, I will create and implement a sales process to convert 30% more renovation leads into sales and so increase the number of building jobs.’
Time bound
Without a completion date, a goal does not provide the impetus or the motivation to act now. You could do nothing this week or the next and still own the goal!
However, a smart goal has a date reference that motivates you to action now. So:
‘By accessing XYZ training, I will create and implement a sales process to convert 30% more renovation leads into sales and so increase the number of building jobs. I will achieve this before the end of the financial year.’
Focus on fewer goals
Productivity studies show that we can’t focus on more than five to seven things at once. Having lots of goals looks impressive, but is unlikely to lead to multiple successes.
Better to keep to a handful of goals – no more than you are able to commit to memory – and don’t cheat by writing countless sub-goals under each goal.
This is a recipe for failure. Instead, write just a few S.M.A.R.T goals, reviewing and amending them each quarter.
Achieving your goals
Some people think that when you write down your goals, you improve your chances of success. Writing forces you to create better goals, especially when you use the S.M.A.R.T check.
But in my experience, it is not the writing down that brings the success – it’s the doing of every step towards the goals that brings success.
Reviewing your goals frequently and planning your weekly task lists with them in mind almost certainly guarantees success, or at least significant progress. The key is to let your goals inspire your actions.
Share your goals
It can also be beneficial to share your goals with a select few, but only those who will encourage you. Avoid the naysayers!

With Christmas looming, it’s a useful time to recap how your business is going to manage staff holiday entitlements and pay.
Summer is a time when many businesses either close down or manage on skeleton staffing arrangements, so that employees can spend Christmas and New Year with family and friends. During this period, staff often take annual leave, as well as public holidays.
Under the Holidays Act 2003, employees are entitled to four weeks’ (20 days’) annual leave after the first year of employment. The key for all employers is:
Working out and agreeing what the entitlement to four weeks’ paid annual leave means.
Ensuring all employees are paid correctly when they take annual leave or their employment ends.
Payment for annual holidays is the greater of the ordinary weekly pay at the time the holiday is taken, or the employee’s average weekly earnings over the 12-month period before the holiday. Please note this calculation may vary where an employee has been on a period of parental leave in the previous 12 months.
Employees can request up to one week of their annual holidays to be paid out. However, it is at the employer’s discretion to agree to the request to cash up the employee’s holidays. If the employer does not agree, he/she doesn’t have to give a reason. Cashing up annual holidays cannot be a negotiated term or condition of the employment agreement.
It is important to note that the one week cash up is not included in gross earnings and it needs to be recorded in the employee’s holiday and leave record.
Public holidays are celebrated on the day they fall, unless the employer and employee agree in writing to transfer the observance of the public holiday to another working day, or where Christmas Day, Boxing Day, New Year’s Day and 2 January fall on either a Saturday or Sunday.
If these four public holidays fall on either a Saturday or Sunday, employees who normally work on these days celebrate the public holiday on these days. For employees who don’t normally work Saturday or Sunday, the public holiday is transferred to the Monday or Tuesday respectively. This year, all the Christmas and New Year holidays fall midweek, meaning the ‘Mondayisation’ of these holidays will not be an issue. To help you decide whether an employee is entitled to take the public holiday, you will need to determine if the public holiday falls on an otherwise working day. MBIE has an online Holiday Tool that can help you with this: visit www.dol.govt.nz/holidaytool
Don’t forget that employees are entitled to a paid day off on these Christmas and New Year holidays, provided that that day would otherwise be a working day for them. The public holiday is paid at the employee’s relevant daily pay or average daily pay rate, as follows.
The relevant daily pay rate is the amount the employee would have received if they had worked their usual hours that day (including regular productivity, commission and overtime payments). For instance, a person may work eight hours a day, Monday-Friday and Monday is a public holiday. They take the day off and they would be paid eight hours for that day.
If it is not possible or practicable to determine an employee’s relevant daily pay, or the daily pay varies within the pay period when the holiday falls, employees are entitled to be paid for the public holiday at their average daily pay rate. For example, if a salesperson is on a base salary and commission, which means their daily pay will fluctuate. They work Monday to Saturday and Labour Day falls on a Monday, which they take off as a holiday. The employer can use the average daily pay calculation to work out their pay for that day.
Average daily pay is a daily average of the employee’s gross earnings over the past 52 weeks; it is divided by the number of whole or part days worked over that period. It should be noted that if a part day was worked, then it’s counted as one day worked for the calculation. For example, if an employee works 210 full days and six part days, their gross earnings are divided by 216 days.
If an employee is required by their employer to work on a public holiday over this period (as opposed to simply electing to do so), the employee is entitled to time and a half (of their relevant daily pay or average daily pay) for all hours worked on that day.
“Now is the time to think about how your business is going to manage staff holiday entitlements and pay
Further, if the public holiday falls on a day that would otherwise have been a working day for the employee, they are also entitled to receive a full paid day off as an alternative holiday.  This is again calculated at either their relevant daily pay or average daily pay rate.
Employers and employees can agree to transfer the employee’s observance of a public holiday to a different working day if certain criteria are met.
There are two situations where this may occur:
Employers and employees can transfer part of a public holiday, in cases where an employee is to start work on one day and finish on the following day.
Employers and employees may agree to transfer the observance of public holidays to another working day, to meet the needs of the business or the individual needs of the employee. For example, an employer and employee may agree to transfer the Boxing Day public holiday to the 26 January, so the employee can celebrate Australia Day as their public holiday.
Special rules apply when there is a customary annual business close down. This close down can occur either across the entire workplace, or for part of an enterprise.
As an employer, you may implement such a closure once a year and require your employees to take annual leave during the period of the close down. You are required to give employees at least 14 days notice.
For employees with less than 12 months’ service, the level of holiday pay for the close down period can be established by:
The employer paying the employee 8% of gross earnings to date (the employee’s anniversary date will then be treated as starting on the date on which the closedown began), or;
The employer and employee agreeing to the employee taking paid annual holidays in advance even though there is no entitlement.

Boom and bust cycles are a part of economic life – what’s important is that you not only grow your business with the recovering economy, but ensure you don’t lose those gains in the next recession
With the economy slowly recovering, self-employed builders have the opportunity to grow their businesses. A smart builder uses these times to improve his business, so it thrives now and is well positioned for the next recession. Here are four tips to help you lay strong foundations now, to ensure your business remains healthy during the next recession.
While the marketing of yesterday may not be relevant today, it’s worth taking time to review what did work during the recession and file it away – it will give you have a successful foundation to build upon when the next recession hits. With some updating, your old strategies are likely to give you get a head start, while others flounder.
Skilled labour is easier to find in a recession, which means less supervision is needed. But when skilled labour is scarce and you have to work with lower skilled or migrant workers, you need to ensure better supervision. During a recession, get your skilled team to record the processes and systems they use to complete efficient, quality work first time – these systems become a valuable tool to keep less skilled workers on track when growing your business.
During a recession, you need better sales skills. However, when growth comes along, it’s easy to forget these skills and rely on demand to assure you work. The temptation when you are busy is to fill your week with on ‘the tools’ work, because the money is good and it feels great to be getting it again. This is not a good long-term strategy; those profits are lost while trying to survive the next recession.
Long-term, real profits are directly related to a business’ ability to sell. If you lose your selling skills, you will be destined to stay on the tools forever. This is okay, if it’s what you want, but not if you wish to grow a building business. Growth periods are the best time to develop sales skills, because you can afford to lose a few sales, while growing your skills.
“Long-term, real profits are directly related to a business’ ability to sell. If you lose your selling skills, you will be destined to stay on the tools forever
Many builders underuse the internet as an advertising tool. Ask yourself where you last searched for a restaurant, a mechanic or subcontractor: chances are it was the internet. A strong website is vital to a growing business.
In the past, a website with a great gallery and heaps of information may have been enough to get business; it is unlikely to keep working in the future. As the competition gets stronger, you need a website to attract your market’s attention.
Now is the time to start focusing your web marketing budget on developing targeted, specific websites and online strategies that will attract visits from your specific target searchers. As search engine technology gets more and more sophisticated, websites providing specific answers are likely to be the ones with the most visitors.
It’s easy to let things slide with money in the bank and work in the schedule. Monthly reports measuring advertising and sales effectiveness, back-quoting to measure productivity and other documenting routines can all get forgotten when business is good.
However, businesses do collapse in growth and it is always the right time to improve your information gathering systems and efficiencies.
A wise man once said: “Build your house on the rock.” Now is the right time to do just that; solidify your business foundations so, no matter what the forecast, it will withstand the elements. The beginning of a growth cycle is always the best time for wise investment in your businesses future.
When competition in the building industry starts to increase, you need to make sure you have a strong enough website to keep the sales coming in

Have you run your business “by the seat of your pants” and managed? Well done. However, today’s challenges may require you to make better decisions in order to keep up with the play. Also, you want to be confident that your decisions are based on facts right for your business
With this in mind, it could be useful to start “dashboarding.”
What is dashboarding? It is simply keeping a monthly record of the key numbers in your business – numbers that you can use to plan your future with a degree of confidence.
If your business doesn’t have a dashboard, then you are likely reliant on your gut feel, or on copying what others are doing. Moreover, your accountant’s end of financial year results, while accurate, are not very helpful for making day-to-day decisions. Have you ever met a builder who consults annual accounts on a daily basis?
Below are five reasons why it’s worth the effort to become proficient at dashboarding. Objective view
1. Objective view
The old proverb “you can’t see the wood for the trees” tells us that, when we get really involved in the detail of a situation, we easily lose sight of the bigger picture. Without that bigger picture, we may be governed by our own opinions and feelings – opinions and feelings that we may believe are the only truth. This can be dangerous!
The good news is that we can overcome this danger by dashboarding. It gives us the actual facts about our business performance. Armed with these, we can go to work and make much better decisions about future actions.
2. Measure trends
Whether you like it or not, you live in the moment – it’s the only time you have. Sometimes the emotions of that moment colour the interpretation of everything else, pushing you to make a wrong conclusion or a poor decision.
For example, a builder I know was facing some immediate pressures which led him to contemplate quitting the business altogether. Right at that moment, a job he was running wasn’t going well and he seemed to be making no headway at all.
However, after a careful comparison of the key business indicators, in the current quarter against the same quarter last year, we discovered that his turnover had actually more than doubled and the net profit had increased seven times!
Overall, the business was moving in the right direction. Admittedly, it was from a low start but the trends were clear. Everything he had been doing was now beginning to bear fruit – it just needed a little more time to become obvious, in spite of some ups and downs.
The thing is, when you keep records, you’re able to track small movements of important ratios and numbers over longer periods (say three months). Reading these trends gives you assurance that you are on the right track, or not.
3. Get early feedback
You need to know if a new initiative is working as soon as possible. You want to know that it is working for you, rather than against you.
For example, if you trialled a scheduling process on a job and it worked well and the team liked it, you might be tempted to run it out on all your jobs. But if careful analysis of the results showed that the job ran a little behind schedule and a little over budget, you would probably want to test another process, or at least trial it again. If you did go ahead and roll out the process just based on a feeling, without knowing the impact or without amending it, your business would gradually lose profit and might eventually fail.
Dashboarding can give you that specific information early – that way, you can quit or amend your processes before it’s too late, or implement them with confidence.
4. Identify intervention
There are plenty of people who are very happy to tell you what you need to make your business fly – “Market more! Sell more! Buy my system! Use my tools!” The list goes on. While this may be great general information and useful at the right time and in the right place, it’s highly unlikely that it’s all relevant at the same time.
Imagine if every time you put your truck in for a service, your well-meaning mechanic overhauled the engine, replaced the gearbox and fitted new tyres, just because new ones are great to have. Well meaning, but inappropriate.
Careful dashboarding can help point out areas in your business where you are weak, or where you have a particular pressure point. If you know this, then you are able to cut through all the advice and focus on the things your business needs now.
For example, a builder having trouble paying her bills, starts dashboarding and discovers that everything is fine – except that her gross margin is 10%, just a little less than her overheads at 11%. She doesn’t need more clients or sales, she just needs to price better, and/or get her team working more efficiently. Focusing on more sales could just make the loss even bigger.
Never prescribe without diagnosis!
5. Compel responsibility
Building businesses can put large amounts of cash through the bank. The numbers can be eye-watering, but a bank account does not paint a true picture of the actual state of the business. To make matters worse, when there is cash in the account, it can be tempting to splash out on new equipment, vehicles and toys – only to discover it is not sustainable. Everyone knows stories where this has happened.
When you get into the habit of checking your dashboard regularly (at least monthly), rather than just the bank account, you are informed of the actual performance of your business – not your imagined performance. You will be able to better anticipate tax payments, future staff requirements, cash flow pressures, and be better prepared to act now for better stability in the future.
Takeaway
If you now feel compelled to dashboard, but you are not sure where to begin, search “dashboard” on the Under Construction website for the article, Stay On Track With a Dashboard. Or get in touch.

This article addresses three problems common to most of our clients and provides advice on how to avoid them
It can never be said that running your own business is easy. For all the perks of being your own boss, it’s a challenging venture.
However, despite the trials and tribulations, if everything goes well, it can be a source of great pride and satisfaction.
While every business and industry is unique, our experience working with the construction industry has shown that the problems they face are often similar to those faced by our other clients.
A reoccurring theme is the importance of cashflow. Without it, a business can’t operate – it’s that simple. Yet people often find it hard to chase up payments once work is completed.
Being too busy is never an excuse; if you haven’t been paid, then your top priority needs to be making sure it happens. Having a difficult conversation with a customer is never easy, but it needs to be done.
What can you do to avoid this problem?
Having a strong contract in place is a good starting point. Robust payment terms, alongside a description of what services are to be performed, put you in good stead to claim payments from even the most difficult customer.
Not only are they then legally obliged pay you; if the worst happens, enforcement of the contract should make payment a formality.
By describing the status of progress payments in your contract, as well as your terms of trade (when payments are due, etc) there should be no confusion. It should also eliminate the prospect of completing a job without being paid.
If a customer is missing progress payments, as outlined in your contract, that’s a big clue there could be problems ahead. If this happens, you can take various measures to protect yourself.
Nearly every tradie will experience this during their lifetime. A project has gone over, the final progress payment has been received, yet you’ve still got a lot of work to do and not much money to cover it.
What can you do to avoid this problem?
This situation is a case of: how well do you know the project and your customer? If you maintain a strong involvement throughout the project, you’re in a much better position to determine if there is going to be an overrun in the first place.
If the problem comes down to customer changes and other issues that are out of your hands – inefficiency is not a customer’s problem – then there may be scope for renegotiating costs.
If you identify problems in advance, the conversation with your customer is much easier.
However, if you only discover issues at the end of a project, you can guarantee that they won’t be open to receiving further invoices over and above what was agreed.
“Having a strong contract in place is a good starting point. Robust payment terms, alongside a description of what services are to be performed, put you in good stead to claim payments from even the most difficult customer
Paying suppliers is often a product of the two points outlined above. If you’re earning good money, paying suppliers is simply a formality. If you’re not, things can get complicated very quickly.
If you are demanding payment from customers on certain terms, then suppliers have a right to expect the same. If you aren’t going to be able to meet a payment, then something needs to be done about it.
Waiting for the debt collectors to call is not a viable alternative – your reputation will be tarnished and no one will want to work with you.
What can you do to avoid this problem?
A better option is to work through any issues with suppliers. If you tell suppliers that you need more time to make a payment, they are likely to be more understanding and make an allowance.
If you can commit to paying them the following month, then you’re front-footing the issue and keeping the relationship strong.
Suppliers face the same problems with customers as you do, so any form of communication with them is a great first step to manage this problem.

Having faced the biggest social disruption of our lifetime, you may be wondering about the future of your business post-lockdown. The landscape feels different, and this raises questions. Will it return to normal? Will you continue to do well?
To do well, it is vital to focus on what your business needs above everything else, and that’s a steady stream of new clients. Without clients, there is no business.
However, advertising costs money, and you may currently be taking a conservative approach with your finances. To combat this, here are five ways that you can advertise without breaking the bank. It may take some of your time, but as one cheese advert states, “good things take time”, and a steady stream of new clients is a good thing for your business.
ASK FAMILY AND FRIENDS
The people who are likely to be most interested in your business’ continued success, other than yourself, are the people closest to you. Talk to them about the jobs you are doing and ask them to put you in touch with anyone they know who might need building work done.
If they need the assistance of a builder, then a recommendation from a close associate, friend, or family member is likely to be well received. However, understand that you may need to adapt, and prepare to take jobs you wouldn’t have pre-lockdown.
Remember, your family members may not be fully up-to-speed with the kind of work you are currently doing and how your business has developed in the past few years, so it might pay to inform them of the space you now operate in. In their eyes, you’re still the best builder around!
RECONNECT WITH PAST CLIENTS
I’m sure you’ve heard that it costs more to advertise to a new client than to get a past client to return. Some say it can cost up to six times more! Most building clients don’t make repeat purchases within one year, but many people use the services of a builder multiple times over the course of a decade.
If you are not already connecting with your past clients on a regular basis, then now is a good time to do so. Go back through your records and build a list of everyone you have connected with, including those who have previously not proceeded past getting a quote.
Send them an email, or if you know their address, send them a letter as well (letters are few and far between today, so can have quite an impact if well-presented). Set up a system, so it’s easier to track your engagement. All of this is planting seeds for the future.
It’s important to remember that past clients also have contacts, so don’t be afraid to send them an introductory gift voucher they can pass on to a friend or family member.
CONNECT WITH NEIGHBOURS OF YOUR CURRENT PROJECTS
Of the builders you know, how many have returned to the same street again and again to complete renovations? This is because neighbourhoods tend to have homes built in a similar style and often at a similar time. If one house is being renovated, then it is highly likely that there will be others in the neighbourhood that are also ready for a makeover.
Don’t waste the opportunity to connect with the neighbours of your current jobs.
Put up a sign as soon as you can. Make sure it’s attractive and oozes quality. It might be the only advertising message the neighbourhood sees, so think about the impression you want it to make.
Introduce yourself to the neighbourhood with a letterbox flyer. It’s old school, but it costs almost nothing to produce and deliver, while still being capable of delivering results. Get your team to help you with the delivery, so they understand the importance of building good relationships with neighbours.
Building good relationships with the neighbours also extends to the behaviour of you and your team members while working or delivering flyers. It’s very easy to undo all the hard work you’ve done to create a good impression by something that seems small, like having someone park in front of the wrong driveway, or leave cigarette butts behind.
ASK FOR REFERRALS EARLY
Don’t wait until a job is completed before asking for a referral. Your client is most excited about their job before it starts, even while it is still in the concept stage! This is when they will be talking about their plans and ideas, while getting opinions and all the rest.
Develop a referral form and leave it with them, so they can note down possible referrals when they think of them – not just when you ask. You can then refer to the form regularly.
Don’t offer money or a discount in exchange for a referral, as I have found that this makes most people uncomfortable, and it risks them feeling like the friendship is being exploited.
However, when they do bring you a referral, make sure to show your appreciation with a ‘spontaneous’ gift.
ENGAGE WITH SOCIAL MEDIA
If you are not already posting on social media, now is a great time to start. There are several platforms you can use, each providing different opportunities to market your business.
Instagram and Facebook are both great for showcasing photos and videos.
Using these platforms, you can post photos or videos that stay on your page (profile) and share a story with photos and videos that lasts for 24 hours. For a small price, you can boost your posts to a wider network of people of your choosing or promote your page to increase your followers.
On Facebook, you can post a blog, ask a question, or tell a longer story about a project by posting updates along the way. You can also add an automatic message pop-up on your page that encourages people to ask a question or book an appointment.
Pinterest is another platform to consider and is more suited to posting finished pictures of completed projects.
There are several social media channels available these days but, no matter which or how many you choose, make sure you have the time and content to make sure it’s done right. It’s better to use one of them effectively rather than use as many as possible half-heartedly. An advantage with Facebook and Instagram is that, because they’re connected, you can post to both simultaneously with the click of a button.
The recent lockdown period has heightened the use of social media, so with a little time and effort you can engage with potential clients through various channels.
If you need help in doing this, www.websitesforbuilders.co.nz is a useful tool to learn more.
TAKEAWAY
Creating a steady stream of clients should be viewed as a necessary practice, rather than an expense. Succeeding in doing so can be rewarding and enjoyable, while providing more control over your future business income.

How do you run a business and train an apprentice without reducing your output or compromising your profitability?
Think back to when you were an apprentice. Would you be where you are today if someone hadn’t given you a chance? Were you teachable? Did you learn fast? Did you make the most of the opportunities you were given?
It is highly likely there are young people just like you were, waiting to be given the opportunity. But before you take on an apprentice, consider the following.
Apprentices will never bring you immediate income. It’s likely that the opposite will be true – they’ll cost you.
You might be tempted to use them as cheap labour for as long as possible, to reduce costs, but doing so is actually counterproductive. It simply lengthens the time it takes for them to get up to speed and be of value to your company. Also, the right kind of apprentice won’t want to spend their days doing menial tasks, such as cleaning up, fetching and carrying; they’ll want to get on to real building as soon as possible.
They’re likely be ambitious and want to learn fast. It’s a good idea to look for this kind of person when employing an apprentice – employ for attitude, train for skill!
Training them may be more challenging and cost more initially, but they will be of much more value to you in the long-term.
Invest in teaching your apprentices on real building skills from the beginning. Don’t see them as a source of cheap labour, look to their longer-term value.
Just because a builder is trade-qualified, doesn’t mean he is competent to train an apprentice. Some are naturals, but others find it difficult.
Training and mentoring is a skill that requires practice. Before you race out and hire an apprentice, talk it over with your builders. Find out where they feel competent and where they feel inadequate conducting training. Make training resources available to them, and ensure they have enough time to handle your apprentices well.
If you have several apprentices, hold special training meetings with the builders primarily responsible for them and discuss some common experiences. Invite training organisations to send reps, as they can field questions and make suggestions.
“Invest in teaching your apprentices on real building skills from the beginning. Don’t see them as a source of cheap labour, look to their longer-term value
Be aware that many apprentices coming straight from school are adapting to the adult world, and some will find it difficult adjusting to life on a building site. Older builders, who are parents themselves, may be better suited to mentoring apprentices straight out of school.
Some of the best apprentices are adults looking for a new career. The current shortage of builders and the attractions of good pay rates (especially in Christchurch and Auckland) have no doubt made the switch attractive. Adult apprentices have already adapted to working life, can train faster and are often able to take responsibility for their own and others’ work.
Some will bring additional skills that can enrich the company. They may have managed teams or contracts and organised events.
Find ways that enable them to use these skills to the benefit of your company. You are likely paying them more, so make the most of their experience. It may be that you find your next project manager in such a person.
Don’t treat them like a school leaver, just because they are starting at the bottom of the building ladder.
When hiring apprentices, ensure that you create an environment that gets them working effectively sooner rather than later. When you put effort into the early stages, they learn the basic skills more quickly. This will give you a better return during their apprenticeship. Then, should they leave at the end of their apprenticeship, you’ve still gained value for your effort.
Young people are often ambitious. Not many want to be stuck with one guy all the time. It’s quite normal for them to want new experiences and challenges and to know they can progress in the company. Ensure that you have a documented career pathway, and let them know they can move up within the company.

As a subcontractor, you are running the risk of exposing yourself to the main developer going bust and refusing to pay your invoices. To protect yourself from that, here are some top tips from Builtin construction risk expert Ben Rickard
Customers not paying came in as the number one risk in Builtin’s 2024 nationwide survey of builders. This is a significant contributor to another risk in the top 10 – cashflow issues leading to financial strain on the business and the people who rely on it.
So, whose fault, is it?
If I was going to be brutal, I would say that most of the reasons for non-payment lie with the builder, not their customers. This is caused by poor process, inadequate documentation and poor communication – which exposes a deeper underlying issue – that builders are generally not as good at the admin side of their business. This can be because it is outside their comfort zone, they don’t have the time to do it properly or they simply haven’t learned the skills to do it well (or they don’t have someone competent they can delegate it to).
Rather than the instinctive reaction, which is always to blame the customer (and to be fair a lot of the time they are entirely to blame), if the builder had a robust process in place, many of these issues of non-payment could be eliminated completely or substantially reduced.
What can you do about it?
Here are some suggestions that, if properly implemented, will significantly reduce the likelihood and/or cost of a customer defaulting on their debt. Some may not be appropriate to all scenarios or business operations, but many of them will be. In no particular order, you should:
1. Have a risk checklist for every job
This includes all the steps you need to take on each job to minimise the risk of non-payment. It ensures that nothing slips through the cracks and the right process is followed every time. Builtin offers a free checklist for the top five risks faced by builders: www.builtin.co.nz/risk-checklist
2. Have good written contracts
These should include default and late payment penalty clauses (for example the ability to pass on interest, legal costs and collection fees) and a dispute resolution process – and get the contract signed! If the client wants to remove some of these clauses, that should be a red flag.
This is probably the biggest failing across the industry and the failure to use them is often down to the reluctance of builders to engage in the ‘awkward conversation’ or justifying it to themselves by saying it’s only a small job.
Even though legally, only contracts over $30,000 must have a written contract, to provide the best protection in the event of a dispute, you must have a contract.
If the customer won’t sign a contract, that should be a huge red flag!
The bottom line is, make this a ‘must do’ before buying any materials or proceeding with any work on site.
3. Set expectations early
Have a conversation prior to signing the contract about payment expectations – have a script to follow or create a short video you can send them a link to. This brings this crucial part of the contract to the fore, especially as homeowners often won’t even have read it.
4. Use payment claims!
Make sure you use Construction Contracts Act (CCA) compliant payment claims and payment schedules (in place of traditional invoices). Using these gives you rights under the CCA to legally enforce payment terms much faster and more cheaply than having to go through the courts. Follow this link for more information.
5. Include more frequent payment milestones
Include payment milestones wherever possible. Requiring little payment often – for example weekly or fortnightly invoicing – is better than monthly or only at the end of the job. If specific milestones trigger payment, try to have more of these throughout the job. While this may mean more paperwork, with a good system this shouldn’t be too painful and is a great way to limit your exposure to large debts.
6. Escrow
Use an escrow service, such as IPromise -. These hold the client’s payment independently until the work has been completed. The fees are affordable and the service includes tools for communicating with clients if they have queries about the payment.
7. Perform a credit check
Construction firms and trades can be checked via Creditworks’ Checkmate option -. Both consumers and businesses can be checked via credit agencies like Centrix, Equifax or Illion.
8. Perform other due diligence
At the bare minimum, carry out social media and Google searches and checks via the Companies Office – which takes two minutes – to see if the company has been in the news for lack of payment or someone has complained about them online, It might not be legitimate, but at least you know you should proceed carefully.
9. Take a deposit
Hold this until the end of the project, rather than using it to cover the first payment milestone.
10. Automate your credit control
Use an invoicing system that automates your credit control process, so any unpaid bills are promptly and regularly pursued with clear escalation and penalties highlighted.
11. Stop work as soon as a payment is late
Don’t get yourself any deeper into the hole, regardless of the promises being made.
12. Invoice factoring
Invoice factoring is when a company sells some or all of its unpaid invoices to a third party, known as a “factor”, in exchange for a cash advance. This cash advance is typically 80% to 90% of the value of the money owed on the invoices. Consider invoice factoring such as FundTap . This may not suit all job types.
13. Consider a bond in lieu of retentions
Providing a bond means your principal doesn’t need to hold retentions. That means your money is immediately available rather than having to wait for them to return it months after the job is completed.
14. Debt collection
If all else fails, refer the debt to a collection agency.
15. Trade credit insurance
This is available but typically very expensive and suits only the largest operators. Small business products, which have more affordable premiums, are generally not offered into the construction sector.
What now?
Take our free risk audit. This covers the top five risks identified by builders and allows users to see how well they are managing each of these. Find it online here .
In a nutshell
There are many things a building business can and should be doing to minimise the risk of a bad debt. However, even with all the options in the world, success fundamentally comes down to the business owners having a robust process that ensures the various solutions they implement are consistently followed.

It can feel like the worst thing in the world if key people in your business go down with Covid. But this doesn’t have to – and shouldn’t – be the case, according to The Successful Builder Graeme Owen
S o, you have contracted Covid-19 or you’re a close contact and can’t get to site.
Or maybe you have key team members off sick and you’re concerned about how your business will survive.
Are such challenges the beginning of the end for your small business ?
No!
Interruptions and challenges, like Covid-19, can be great learning events. Here are three things I’ve noted that business owners have learned from Covid-19 interruptions.
1. Identifying weaknesses
As an engineering student, I made concrete blocks of different consistencies. All the blocks looked the same – even though they had differing constituencies – but under pressure, those differences showed up and the weakest blocks cracked first. I learned, first hand, the results of skimping on cement.
Similarly, the weaknesses in your company may only emerge when it’s under pressure. For example, when Covid-19 skims the top off your team, or hits you and you can’t visit any sites, identifying the ’cracks’ that develop provides insight as to what you can do to strengthen your company.
In the first instance, of course, you will have to intervene and act quickly to stay upright and avoid panic. But once you have taken immediate action, pause for a moment or two to consider what could have been in place to minimise disruption.
For example, a builder I know, who was rushing from site to site, sorting details and running errands, identified that his site managers were not good at scheduling work, ordering materials, or booking subbies and needed to improve their planning overall.
To address the issue, he instituted a two-week ’look-ahead’ form, where the site manager lists and schedules the tasks to be completed, and those responsible for completing them, over the next two weeks. It also lists and schedules the materials to be ordered and the subbies to be contacted.
Once in place, this 14-day ’look-ahead’ plan is reported against and updated each week for the next fortnight. So, should a site manager be absent suddenly, the team has – at a minimum – one week of work planned. This gives time for any changes to be made without panic.
Moreover, it greatly reduces the number of times the business owner had to visit sites.
2. Leaders emerge
There is a big difference between authority that comes from having a position and the authority that comes from personality. I call it the difference between positional leadership and natural leadership. Positional leadership gains its authority from above, whereas natural leadership gains its authority from within.
It’s in emergencies, when positional leaders are absent, that natural leaders emerge. These are the ones who step up to help, work longer hours, come up with possible solutions, or offer to go the extra mile. They are also the ones that others will readily follow. Often, they will remain calm, assess situations and decide what needs to be done. Of course, what they know needs to be done will be determined by their experience and sometimes they will make mistakes.
But the astute business owner will recognise early signs of leadership and ensure that such people are given the training and opportunities to step up into positional leadership roles.
So, next time you have an emergency, look to see if any future leaders are showing up.
3. You are dispensable
When was the last time you slept under a bridge because you had nowhere to stay ?
Never! So it’s true. Our worst fears are seldom realised.
Yet many small business owners act as though their business will fall over unless everything passes through them. Initially, of course, that’s probably true, but after a few years and with several staff, it’s no longer true. Others can do what you do – more or less. It’s crazy to think you are the only one! You are not indispensable.
Sure, your team may not be as motivated as you are and they may not do something quite as well as you do, but they can likely do a decent job that will make the client happy – either going forward (so you don’t have to be involved with everything!) or until you’re back on your feet post Covid.
A builder I know would take holidays for several weeks at a time. As his company grew, his time away would extend. Sometimes he would be uncontactable for much of the time away. He believed that a company needs to become a commercial enterprise that (essentially) runs itself. So, he let it do so!
It was always interesting when he returned to discover that almost every challenge that he would normally get involved in had been solved without his presence!
On the other hand, it showed that some in leadership were not really capable of leading.
So, give up the ’everyone needs me’ beliefs and facilitate others to do the work for you!
Takeaway
While adversity may not be desirable, it doesn’t need to be destructive. In fact, it can be the springboard to becoming an even stronger company.

Closing the doors might be the last thought on your mind when starting a business, but it’s important to prepare a succession plan to ensure the future of your company.
Failing to plan for your business’ succession can often undo all of your previous hard work; the brand, reputation and history of your business can be lost immediately and leave you out of pocket.
According to the 2013 ANZ Privately Owned Business Barometer, 29% of respondents identified succession-related issues facing their business. This is a dangerous trend, especially with New Zealand’s ageing population. In the near future, there may be a glut of businesses for sale in the construction sector. The key questions owners have to ask themselves are: ‘How can I avoid missing out on my retirement?’ and ‘How can I stand out from the crowd?’
Firstly, you should assess and prepare a logical succession plan that applies to any reasons that may require you to leave the business.
When would be the ideal time to dispose of the business (if at all)?
What would be the value of the business at that point?
Who would offer the most to the business owner? (Is there a family member or a third party that could leave the remaining family members with cash?)
The tax planning and structure issues that need to be navigated.
What happens to the staff / client relationships / business image when the owner leaves the business?
Can someone else do more for the business over the next ten years than you can?
As the current business owner, you know your business’ strengths and weaknesses and are generally best informed to assess its value. Having a liquidator or the executor of your estate manage the sale almost always leads to a less than optimal return. For these reasons, the best time to realise the maximum value is when you are around to sell it.
“While you may think that your business isn’t worth anything to another person, you need to consider your full body of work, and the reputation you have built along the way; it may be worth more than you think
There is no single ‘right way’ to sell or exit your business; the question of ‘how?’ should be considered with another: who to sell it to? Your succession planning needs to include a full appraisal of the business and the people in it.
Unless you’re operating as a one-man band, there will often be the potential to sell to an employee or business partner, who will benefit from taking on the business name, reputation and financial history. In the case of employees, progressive ownership options – the offer of ownership down the track, based on certain performance objectives – or a straight sale can all be options.
But none of these alternatives can be made available overnight; they take years of planning.
It’s very important to understand what you’re selling. When you first started out in business, it was likely any work you won (and continued to win) was based purely on the quality of your work and the personal qualities you showed potential customers. Selling your business is exactly the same – effectively, you’re selling the reputation you’ve built over years of operating, not just the value of your balance sheet.
This leads to another key consideration for the exiting owner – do you want the person you have in mind carrying on the business in your name? Moving on from your business is a tricky proposition – there are a multitude of factors to consider. However, the sooner an exit strategy is in place, the smoother the transition at the end of your time in the business. While you may think that your business isn’t worth anything to another person, you need to consider your full body of work, and the reputation you have built along the way; it may be worth more than you think.
If you have questions about succession planning, whether you are looking to exit your business in the next few years or if you want to discuss a long-term strategy, please contact Peter van der Heijden at peter.vdh@crowehorwath.co.nz ; or contact your local Crowe Horwath advisor.

As the construction market slows down, some employers may be tempted to cut spending on health and safety programmes. While tempting, it’s a move you should avoid at all costs – explains The Successful Builder
T he Successful Builder business coach wasn’t surprised when one of his builders brought it up. “ Look mate! With construction slowing, and the market getting more competitive, I can’t afford to keep spending on our health and safety programme,” he said. The business coach was even tempted to agree. B ut then he started thinking about all the ways that a robust H&S programme can boost efficiency, improve a company’s reputation and reduce costs. Sure, you don’t want to go over the top with your H&S programme, and it may be that now is the right time to review your processes, but a robust H&S culture will save you money. Consider these points.
1 . Reduced accidents and injuries I mplementing and regularly maintaining your protocols for proper equipment training, hazard identification and personal protective equipment (PPE) can significantly lower the risk of accidents and injuries. It can be as simple as always wearing a high-vis jacket – just make sure such things are standard practice. It really is not worth the risk of a serious on-site accident. Train your leaders to expect that team members wear proper hard hats, boots etc. and that everyone is properly trained in your processes in working at heights. Also, check that you have solid protocols around use of machinery, especially lifting machinery. The thing is, good safety procedures are often more efficient – because you have thought it through in advance.
2. Improved morale and productivity P roviding a safe working environment demonstrates that you care for your employees’ wellbeing. Done with the right attitude, this increases morale. Moreover, when your regular tool box meetings double as safe places for feedback, discussing better ways of working, encouraging innovation and rewarding goal achievement, the increased morale almost always leads to increased productivity.
T ry it! When you listen to your team members, they feel valued. For example, implement a safety incentive program that rewards your team when they complete safety protocols correctly and when they suggest improvements.
3. Enhance reputation and brand image H ome renovators can especially benefit by showcasing to potential clients their safety certifications, adherence to industry standards and successful safety records. This instils confidence among customers – especially when their household includes children. Also, a safe and tidy site gives the appearance of professionalism and efficiency.
It goes without saying that quality commercial companies want to engage with similar companies. So, being able to show them testimonials that include reference to your safe and tidy site practices improves your chances of being hired. No quality company wants to engage with another that has a history of serious accidents.
4. Compliance with regulations and standards M aintaining your health and safety programme ensures that you are complying with your legal requirements. Staying updated on relevant laws, codes and standards, and training your team in these, is not only good for the professional development of your team, it also reduces your chances of facing fines and penalties or even a project shutdown.
5. Cost savings W hile initial investments in safety measures may seem substantial, they ultimately lead to long-term cost savings. For example, investing in a high-quality safety harness system can ensure your team members focus their total attention on completing the jobs at hand, rather than being distracted by the fear of falling. Moreover, having a common process on using particular equipment ensures that everyone can operate it the same way, which saves time. F urthermore, good training programmes reduce the likelihood of accidents and their related expenses, and can possibly lead to lower insurance premiums.
6. Minimised project delays A ccidents and injuries can cause significant project delays, impacting timelines and profitability. By implementing safety protocols and conducting regular inspections, you can identify and mitigate potential hazards before they escalate into accidents.
For instance, proactive measures such as checking scaffolding installation, fall protection systems and site cleanliness, minimise the risk of falls and other common construction accidents, thereby preventing costly delays.
I t goes without saying that avoiding project delays and disruptions due to accidents saves money by keeping projects on schedule and within budget.
7. Sustainable business growth P rioritising health and safety demonstrates your commitment to responsible business practices. By protecting your workers’ health and safety and delivering quality to your clients, the community and your shareholders, you can build trust within the industry. And this trust translates into repeat business, referrals, and opportunities for expansion. Moreover, a positive safety record enhances your brand reputation, positioning you as a reliable and trustworthy partner for future projects.
Takeaway A s you navigate the changes in the construction industry, remember that investing in the well-being of your team and the efficiency of your projects is not just a business strategy – it’s a commitment to excellence. By integrating some of these simple principles, you’ll not only enhance the success of your business, but also contribute to a safer and more sustainable future for your team and your clients.

It’s no coincidence that the same builders always attract the most desirable and profitable jobs, while enjoying excellent client relationships. Here, we outline five tips that will help transform your business into a market leader
Just as a winning home is a combination of great design, materials and experienced project management, so is a successful building business. While not greatly powerful on their own, the following tips used in conjunction with one another will help give your company the aura of quiet confidence that clients are looking for.
First impressions count and can be the single biggest factor in a prospective client’s decision-making process when selecting a builder. It’s important their very first encounter with your company is captivating, connecting and elicits a positive response.
Consider the impact of a powerful slogan – one that drives customers to pick up the phone and call you. Imagine having a website, signs and vehicles that attract people to you because your slogan connects powerfully.
Then imagine how reassured they feel when they connect with you and discover you deliver on what you say. Consider the following when developing your business’ slogan:
Is it captivating?
Does it connect?
Is it generating responses?
A customer-focused sales process outlines in advance the steps a customer needs to take in order to arrive at the best possible solution, even if that means using another builder! It should be proven and explain simply what needs to do be done to:
Explore your client’s needs and aspirations.
Introduce them to previous clients (who rave about you).
Calm their nerves with your iron-clad guarantees.
The confident builder knows that his sales system works; there is no need for him to try to coerce the client.
To build your own customer-focused sales process, start by documenting what you currently do. List each step and write a script, then continually improve it over time till you figure out what works.
When your process is good, you won’t need to hire top salespeople to get great sales – just good people who will follow your well-oiled system!
The impact a conscientious team of builders, designers and salespeople can have on a prospective buyer is huge; they can turn your clients into raving fans. Imagine if everyone shared your company vision, took ownership in achieving it, and were willing to go the extra mile to provide a great customer experience.
Take time to learn how to create a culture that you’re proud of. If you don’t know how, push yourself to learn – it will transform you and your business.
It’s no good if you have a fantastic sales funnel and can’t deliver on your promise. If you’re unable to, you shouldn’t be in business and most likely won’t be for long.
Once work has started, it’s in the hands of your tradespeople. If they fail, it’s costly and you are reliant on them doing a good job. When your customers love your team, they’ll tell others.
Confident and successful builders choose their team members carefully, ensuring they have adequate knowledge and qualifications. They manage them well and give them the resources they need to do a good job knowing that, in the end, the company will be judged by their workmanship.
Never compromise on your key tradespeople!
Money is the oil that keeps everything in your business flowing smoothly. It needs to be transferred correctly and on time.
When it isn’t, it’s catastrophic! Incorrect or late invoicing and poor cash-flow management can kill an otherwise great business. Learn the basics of good accounting administration and put in place sound practices for invoicing and receiving money.
There is often a big difference between a winning and an average building company, but in most cases that big difference is simply a combination of many small ones. Take heart! They can all be fixed.

You know the post-Covid world will be different – but how different? We can only really guess. While the world might be changing, some things don’t. Building your life and business on these ‘unchangeables’ can help you survive, and hopefully thrive, in the months ahead
Below are some key unchangeables to focus on right now.
1. Choose your mindset
No matter how big or small your circle of influence, you have a choice as to whether you influence that circle positively or negatively. If you just go with the flow, your circle may be influenced negatively by what’s popular on social media.
You can’t change the environment in which you do business, but you can choose how you will respond to that environment. You can choose to remain positive and help your team do the same.
As the business owner, you are the leader – so choose to be a positive influence.
2. Perspective shapes outlook
If you live in New Zealand you are very lucky. Sure, Covid-19 is a challenge, but you are not living in a war zone. In comparison with many other people around the world, you are living in paradise!
The thing is, when you view life from that perspective, you are more likely to look to the future with confidence. Everyone around you is living in the same environment, but it’s those who acknowledge the strength of the situation who find new opportunities and thrive.
Accept your situation and look to the future with hope. Don’t waste time wishing things were the way they used to be, focus on the way things could be.
3. Fact beats opinion
The businesses that do well in changing situations are those with a leader/owner who doesn’t get side-tracked or panicked by popular opinions.
Sure, leaders listen, but they are careful who they listen to. They analyse, look for verified facts, read widely, and search for early indicators of trends in their marketplace.
So, find out more about those you are listening to. Do they have the qualifications or experience and verified facts to support their opinions? Ask questions – don’t simply follow the crowd.
4. Analysis beats guesswork
The best governments around the world use experts to gather and analyse information on the progression of Covid-19, so they can make the best possible decisions.
In the same way, you need accurate information to make the best decisions for your future – such as information about past performance and good estimates about likely changes in the new environment.
For example, do you know how long it takes your team to build a foundation? Or frame out a 150m 2 standard house?
If you are confident in your knowledge, then you should be able to estimate how much longer it will take while adhering to the required social distancing measures.
If you know your suppliers’ past performance, then you can factor in additional delay times.
The more detail you have on your team’s performance, the easier it is going to be for you to create winning proposals for the (potentially more competitive) future.
Intuition is a good guide but, in changing times, you want to ensure it is coupled with accurate analysis.
5. Proactivity beats reactivity
Governments enact laws that guide activity in a particular environment, but it’s up to people to take action within those guidelines to benefit themselves and the community.
So, be proactive. Think about what you could do if the current environment were to continue long term. What changes would you make? What new services or products would you test? How would you test these new ideas? Who might you partner with?
Get ahead of the competition by thinking outside the box.
6. Planning feeds direction
Well-informed leaders make decisions and plans for the immediate future of their businesses. They don’t wait around. Even though they know that these may need to change rapidly (daily in some cases), they make their plans and set their direction based on the best current information. Then, as more information comes to hand, they adjust their plans to suit.
Others wait until change slows, or for the past to return, and then make their plans. However, in the interim, their business lacks direction and is unprepared to meet the changed environment. This can be fatal.
So, paradoxically, the process of planning, setting direction and re-planning can be a constant in your business in turbulent times.
7. Teams who feel secure perform better
If everything else is equal, then team members who feel secure perform better than those who don’t. Rapid change, such as we’ve experienced recently, often results in feelings of insecurity. However, you may be able to help reduce such feelings for your team members by letting them know that you are keeping abreast (or better, ahead) of the current situation and that you are adjusting the company plans accordingly.
Let them know what plans you have, even if they are temporary, as it can help them focus on the job rather than worrying about the future, because they trust the company is in good hands.
8. Customers like to be informed
Your customers are people, too. They have fears, and likely some new ones! Will the builder they contracted still be around to start their build? What is their builder doing to survive the recession? Will their builder be able to complete the job? Will they honour their guarantees? What will happen to prices? Will the same level of quality be guaranteed?
Companies that will shine in the coming days are those that listen to the fears of their customers and communicate clearly as to how their processes, services and systems overcome these concerns.
Whatever the environment, customers appreciate being treated well.
9. Life goes on
It’s very likely that our country will face a period of recession. Some businesses will not survive, so if you haven’t been through a recession before, you need to learn how to live through one.
Typically, some markets shrink in recession as people delay expenditure, yet others thrive as people press ahead, making the most of the greater availability of services. Also, the profile and behaviour of the typical buyer in your market may change.
So, to thrive in recession, you may need to refocus your marketing to meet your customers’ new demands.
Or, because there will be more competition, you may need to work to increase your market share.
On the other hand, it may be easier to attract good staff if less stable businesses close.
No matter what the outcome, focus on determining what the new market looks like, and adapting your business to suit.
Takeaway
In times of change, you can strengthen your business by focusing on those things that do not change.

A perennial conundrum of the building industry is how to hold on to good apprentices once they’ve completed their training to get the best return on your investment
A common story with apprentices is that once they are fully trained and have become worthwhile to their trainers, they leave and join a competitor or set up their own business. This is particularly true when builders are in high demand, as they are now.
Why take on an apprentice?
When there is an abundance of work, taking time out to demonstrate and explain can be a distraction.
However, most builders I’ve spoken to would agree that good apprentices, with the right attitude, are invaluable. In fact, without them, building costs would likely increase.
They provide low-cost labour for many straightforward tasks as they learn the basics and, when they become qualified and stay with the company, they are already familiar with the company’s processes and culture. They also know how the company does business and what standards of customer satisfaction are expected, which can be a huge advantage if they stay on.
Another aspect to remember is that today’s apprentices are tomorrow’s builders. The future of the industry is reliant on experienced builders and tradespeople taking the time out to properly train apprentices.
How do you go about keeping good apprentices? 1. Plan to grow your team
If you don’t grow your team, you can’t add good apprentices. Great teams don’t just happen, they come about as a result of careful and consistent work by business owners who focus on training people and creating the kind of environment that allows their team to deliver a service that customers want to buy.
Over time, as builders deliver those services consistently well, demand increases and the company grows. Careful business owners learn how to handle the issues that come with growth and manage it carefully and securely.
It makes sense to start learning the skills needed to grow your business at the same time as you take on your first apprentice(s). The thing is, if you are not confident in growing your business, then you will only be able to add very few staff before you reach your maximum.
You can keep taking on new apprentices, but if there is no room to move up after you train them, they will most likely leave you.
If you’re a good builder who teaches your apprentice well, then you are contributing good people to the industry. However, it’s a shame to let someone else reap the return on your investment due to a lack of growth in your own company.
Growing a building business is not rocket science. There are pitfalls to be aware of, but there are many resources you can draw on to help you avoid these. If you approach it with a long-term plan and proven strategies, you can do well.
2. Offer them a future Most apprentices worth their salt will want to know what opportunities exist within the company once they become qualified. Consider the following questions from their point of view:
Will they get a variety of work experience ?
Is architectural work on the horizon ?
Is promotion to site supervisor possible ?
Could a project management role open up down the track ?
Are there opportunities to learn about pricing and selling ?
Take the time to listen to their ambitions. That way, if they want to stay with the company, you will have time to consider how you can help them fulfill those ambitions.
3. Help them get qualified Some apprentices are good at bookwork, others are not. Although they may be competent, unqualified staff can’t take legal responsibility for their work, which means someone else must.
The best staff members (in my opinion) are those who not only take responsibility for their actions, but are motivated to learn and progress.
A young apprentice may be distracted by his/her new freedoms, and knuckling down and getting qualified may seem a drudge, but setting the pattern of steady (even fast) learning and development is good for the apprentice and the company’s culture.
Helping your apprentices to set and achieve learning goals has got to be good for everyone.
Independent of immediate economic considerations, training and developing apprentices, then incorporating them into your team, is a key strategy when it comes to growing a successful building business.

Business growth is an important consideration for those who aspire to ‘get off the tools’, but the days of doing deals on a handshake are long gone. This month, we focus on a couple of key points to keep in mind when buying a business
I n the May issue of Under Construction, we provided information on how to grow a business, including the risks and rewards associated with acquisition. This time, we outline some of the key things to watch for and provide a general overview of what you need to know before finalising any deal.
Paperwork, paperwork, paperwork
Obviously, for a transaction of such a large size, it is important to work closely with your lawyer and the seller to ensure the business’ sale and purchase agreement is fully documented.
It’s also particularly important to document how any debts and potential issues relevant to the business will be handled. There needs to be a clear agreement in place on how defect periods and potential liabilities for works undertaken by the previous owner/s are handled. If this isn’t done properly then you, as the new business owner, could be left responsible for any outstanding bills. Furthermore, your name could potentially be tarnished by work done under the previous owner/s.
When it comes to the required paperwork, consider this: no one would ever buy a house or enter into a job without a formal contract. So why would you consider buying a business without having the proper paperwork in place ?
Known and unknown debts
Any known liabilities in the business’ financial statements are still held by ‘the business’, therefore, these will need to be taken into consideration. These are debts owed by the business, not the owners. For that reason, performing due diligence in conjunction with your accountant is crucial.
They can help you to identify both known and potential liabilities, and will provide a written report detailing their professional opinion of the business and its value. Usually, there will be give and take between both parties on the final selling price, but due diligence reports provide a good starting point for negotiations.
Do the due
Due diligence is all about cutting through the sales pitch and bluster. It provides a degree of certainty about what you’re buying, and what to expect once the transaction is complete. It also supports a closer working relationship between the buyer and seller throughout the negotiation period.
As a result, most owners are more than happy to provide the required information for this process. Be particularly wary of anyone selling a business, who is reluctant to provide information requested for a due diligence report. This should be seen as an immediate ‘red flag’, and an indication that particular business opportunity might be best left alone.
Another point regarding debts is that any shareholder loan accounts (money owed to/from the shareholder by the company) will need to be repaid, unless you come to an agreement with the seller. Usually, the amount will be incorporated into the business’ purchase price.
However, if you are buying a majority share (ie, more than 50% of the business), there may be another agreement in place – such as the previous owners loan account being paid off over time, or that the account remains in place due to their ownership interest in the company. On the other hand, if the business is owed money by shareholders, then this must be repaid either by the shareholder or from proceeds of the sale of the business.
Pitfalls
In our May article, we discussed the potential issues that can occur with an acquisition. Most notably: buying an underperforming business, where turnover was inflated by a one-off transaction and has systems that are incompatible with your own. These issues further reinforce the need to do your homework via the due diligence process, so that a business’ financial and general operations are fully understood.
For example, is a key employee due to retire in the next 12 months ? Is a key contract about to lapse and not be renewed ? These sorts of situations need to be identified in advance, as they could have a significant impact on the long-term value and performance of a business. Having a thorough understanding of the potential of the business is critical for success.
Don’t forget the staff
Another issue to be aware of is the business’ ‘culture’. While this can often be viewed as a buzzword, the fact remains that if your new employees do not work well with existing staff, then the disruptions that could cause are immense.
While you cannot be sure that these issues won’t arise before buying a business, a considerable amount of time and effort can be spent trying to identify and resolve these sorts of issues if they do.
Taking the time to make sure that all employees are well looked after is arguably just as important as ensuring that you keep the financial performance of the newly acquired business intact.
If you have questions about how to acquire a business, or you would like to discuss any of the points raised in this article, please contact Peter van der Heijden at peter.vdh@crowehorwath.co.nz ; or your local Crowe Horwath advisor.

I n 2012, BRANZ ran the second New House Owners’ Satisfaction Survey. It focused on new homeowners’ assessments of builder performance in order to assist work on building industry performance measures.
It’s also a good tool for builders to find out what’s most important to their customers and how they decide who to trust to build their homes.
BRANZ received 1,258 survey responses (29%), which is a large enough sample size to provide accurate results. Overall, the vast majority of new house owners said they would recommend their builder – and those with good communication and project management skills scored the highest.
New house owners were first asked about their satisfaction levels and how they would rate their builder on ten different aspects.
The highest satisfaction levels were for:
Overall quality of the home.
Service during the build.
Standard of finish.
The aspects that scored lowest were:
Service after moving in.
Fixing of defects after occupancy.
Questions also covered input into the design of the house, how the builder was chosen, features considered important when choosing a builder, disputes over final costs, type of contract and how the builder could improve the build process.
Every aspect improved from the previous survey, except the ‘overall quality of your home’, which was down slightly.
The vast majority of new homeowners said they would recommend their builder.
Where comments were positive about communication and project management, the average satisfaction levels and ratings were very high.
When choosing a builder, the most important factor for new homeowners was being confident in the builder’s quality and reputation, thanks to a recommendation from a friend or family member. Timely completion, fixed-price certainty and having looked at the builder’s previous houses were also important. (see Figure 1)
With the majority of respondents stating quality and reputation as the most important selection criteria, there was a wider range of satisfaction ratings for the various aspects of the build. However, overall the average ratings were higher than most.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, homeowners who stated that the lowest price was an important feature in choosing their builder had the lowest satisfaction scores in the majority of aspects. The only aspect they were not unsatisfied with in this case was the final cost compared to expected cost.
Surprisingly, those homeowners who stated that an important feature in choosing their builder was fixed-price certainty were not the most satisfied with the final cost compared to expected cost at signing contract.
Some 12.4% of respondents were critical of their builder and 12.1% had a dispute with their builder over final costs. Reasons for disputes varied from being overcharged, extras that were/were not included, items left out of contract or incomplete work, to name a few.
The most common type of contract – with a fixed price (including all trades) with changes requested after signing – has the highest percentage of disputes over final costs. The most common issue was the cost of earthworks or retaining walls being more than expected. Other common issues included hidden costs, council fees and under-quoted provisional costs.
Although the call-back rate – where owners asked their builder to repair defects after first occupancy – was down by 4.4% from the last quarter, it is still high at 67.9% of respondents. The most common source of defect was with paint, with almost 300 of the houses surveyed requiring some type of touch up. Other common defects included doors requiring adjustments, mainly due to sticking.
A number of builders also had poor communication with the new house owner, leading to much lower than average satisfaction and ratings.
Similarly, some builders did not project manage the build to a suitable standard for their customer.
The final section of the survey asked for general comments on the overall performance of the builder. Two common themes emerged:
The importance of good project management.
The importance of good communication.
Where they were spoken about positively, the satisfaction/ratings were much higher than when the homeowner spoke negatively about them. Poor communication and project management led to significantly worse average scores for the builder.
A significant proportion of new owners speak critically about their builder. Given that recommendations are such an important source of new work, this should be of real concern. Make sure you discuss costs and expectations thoroughly with your clients – no one likes surprises!
Work also needs to be done on further reducing the number of call-backs. These largely involve work done by subcontractors, indicating a lack of quality control and project management by the builder, which ultimately reflects badly on them.

Your clients want an accurate quotation for their renovation. They want to know how much it is going to cost. And rightly so! However, they have no idea how much of your time and expertise it actually costs to get everything together for their quote. What’s more, many builders don’t know how much it costs them either! In this article, business coach Graeme Owen explains how you can capture and charge the time you take to prepare quotes
M any clients perceive quotes as simple, quick estimates that you can p rovide by simply taking a walk-through. After all, you are a builder – you of all people should know! I n reality, creating a comprehensive quote involves significant time, expertise and resources. You need to make site visits, determine the scope of work, and guess what lies behind the surface of the existing structure. Then you need to source materials and estimate labour costs.
The average builder puts a substantial effort into this process, but rarely includes it in the cost of the project. This hidden cost, if left uncompensated, can seriously impact the overall profitability and sustainability of your business. So, to address this, you need to charge out the time you spend preparing quotations. But how to do so? Here are eight things you can do.
1. Change the perception
One reason your clients expect you to provide a free quotation is because that’s what tradespeople do! However, they don’t expect professionals, such as their accountant, lawyer or architect, to do the same. Your clients expect these professionals to charge from the first phone call, even if just for a few minutes! So, become a professional! Quit thinking of yourself as a builder. Rather, reinvent yourself as a professional building advisor. When you do so, you will be able to charge for the time you spend providing your clients with professional advice. That’s what a quotation is really – costing advice on, say, a renovation proposal.
Check out all the ways in which you currently show your client that you are a tradesperson and make the changes necessary, so they see you as a professional building advisor. Sharpen up your appearance, improve your sales tools, clean up your vehicle and work on your sales script!
2. Educate your clients
No one else will. So, it’s up to you to teach them! Make clients aware of the time, expertise and resources required to prepare a comprehensive and accurate project proposal. Highlight the benefits of a detailed quotation, such as better project planning and cost transparency, and show how your preliminary work can minimise the risk of unexpected expenses. Put all of this together into a project planning brochure and hand it to them during your first meeting. Additionally, you could create blogs or videos that explain the quotation process and show the value of a thorough project proposal.
3. Offer a free initial consultation
In spite of what I’ve said above, it’s always a good idea to provide a free initial consultation. In it, you can introduce yourself fully and discuss your client’s needs. You can assess the project scope and demonstrate your expertise. Use this meeting to build trust and showcase your professionalism.
Explain that this initial consultation is complimentary and that any further professional advice (such as preparing a detailed, written pricing plan or structure) requires significant effort and will be charged accordingly.
At the end of your complimentary consultation, ask your client if they would like to proceed to the next step.
4. Introduce your quotation fee structure
If your client agrees to proceed, then outline the next steps. Explain what you will need to do, such as site visits, the introduction of subcontractors to the project, work with designers and architects, development of materials schedules and contacting suppliers, detailed planning and calculating labour requirements.
Then, develop a fee structure based on the project size and complexity. Remember to clearly outline what the fee covers in each case. You may want to prepare a template of fee structures for typical projects, such as a typical bathroom renovation.
Remember, do not leave your first meeting without gaining agreement on your fee before doing any quoting.
5. Gift your quotation fees
As an incentive, you may offer to deduct the quotation fee from the final project cost if the client proceeds to build with you. This can incentivise your client to commit to your business, while ensuring that your time spent on the quote is, at least, compensated.
6. Provide a detailed quotation
As well as ensuring that your quotation is professionally presented, ensure that it includes a detailed scope of work – the more detailed, the better. Remember: most clients know nothing about building. Show project timelines and details of costs.
This level of detail not only justifies the fee but also sets clear expectations for the project. Investing in good digital tools will help you here.
7. Highlight your expertise and experience
Use your marketing materials, your website and your client interactions to emphasise your experience, qualifications and the quality of your workmanship.
Some builders use a folder (digital or hard copy) to showcase previous successful projects that are similar to the client’s plans. Doing this will raise your client’s confidence in you, especially if you can show previous jobs where finished costs were in line with your quotation.
8. Use a contract for quotation services
Develop a short agreement specifically for quotation services as detailed above. This document should outline the scope of the quotation work, the fee and the terms of payment. As above, ensure that clients sign this agreement before you begin the quotation process.
Implementing these strategies can help you transition to charging for the time you spend on preparing quotations and being fairly compensated for your expertise and effort.

A recession is officially here and that’s unsettling for business owners. However, business coach Graeme Owen says it’s possible not only to survive, but to thrive, in a recession. Read on for his top tips on how to do that!
So, it’s officially here – recession! And you, like most business owners, are a bit worried, wondering what you need to do to get enough work to survive. Am I right ?
Well, don’t panic – take action! In a recession, construction businesses face a changing set of circumstances as clients’ buying habits change. There is less available money, jobs get cancelled, and some builders go bust. Does that mean you should close up shop ? No, not at all! But there will be changes.
Most likely you are similar to the builders I know – resourceful and able to handle unexpected circumstances. Things happen in a build that no one can predict, but you handle them with ease! So, why not simply think of a recession as just another unplanned-for event ? Unleash your problem-solving abilities and find your way through. You may even discover ways to thrive.
One crucial thing is to master a new set of sales skills that are specifically tailored to the demands of a downturn. In this article, we will explore some of the essential skills you can implement to not only survive, but to thrive. By honing these skills, you will be better positioned to meet the changing market dynamics and secure a steady stream of sales.
1. Be strategic in targeting your marketing
Effective prospecting is vital during a recession. You need to identify and prioritise those target markets that have a higher likelihood of generating sales. You need to find people who are less affected by recession and focus on directing your marketing to these potential clients.
Develop a good understanding of your target market’s pain points. Remember, they may not be the same as your own pain points, or even of the people with whom you socialise, so you will need to research their needs and budgets. Then, tailor your marketing and sales process to present customised solutions that resonate with these specific audiences.
2. Value base your selling
In a recession, if you are still generating leads from the same sector of the population as you were in previous years, then you are likely to notice an increase in price sensitivity.
Unfortunately, many builders don’t know how to accommodate price-sensitive people. Sometimes they drive them away by emphasising how much costs are rising, or they go too far the other way, and risk their own business’ security by getting into a discounting war with another builder, where everyone loses!
What you need to do is shift your sales approach from price-driven to value-driven. Emphasise the long-term benefits of your service and the return on investment that quality construction and craftsmanship can provide. And tell them about your guarantee.
If possible, clearly outline your unique value propositions. It might be the energy efficiency of your plans, your sustainable building practices, or the durability of the materials you use. It may be your superior customer experience during the build and your follow-up service afterwards.
The thing is, when you demonstrate the value of what you offer, you help your potential client to see beyond the short-term costs and appreciate the long-term advantages of your solutions.
3. Build trusting relationships
Trust is paramount during challenging economic times, so focus on building strong relationships with potential clients. Be polite, reliable and transparent. Demonstrate your expertise by providing testimonials. Or, better still, show them your previous work and present some case studies that highlight how you have achieved satisfied clients.
Actively listen to your clients’ concerns and address those concerns proactively, especially during your early encounters.
For example, in the early stages of meeting with your prospective client, you might say: “Some of our clients have been concerned that their building costs will blow their budget. While it’s true that building a home does take a long time and some input costs cannot be fully guaranteed, be assured that we go through the plans and price everything listed in the specifications. We take great care in including everything.
“Also, if you wish, we will give you the opportunity to pre-purchase many of your building materials, so that you can lock in the current prices.
“However, if something completely unexpected does arise, we will inform you immediately and work with you to find the best way forward.
“At no time will you incur any additional cost without your full agreement.”
By nurturing trust and fostering open communication, you can develop long-lasting relationships that lead to referrals and, possibly, repeat business.
4. Adapt your negotiation skills
During a recession, negotiation skills become vital in securing favourable deals. You may need to be flexible and willing to explore alternative options to accommodate your clients’ budgets. You may need to reduce the scope of a build or renovation, but do so without compromising profitability.
Focus on win-win outcomes and creative solutions that satisfy both parties. Understand the value of any ’ sweeteners ’ you are offering and be prepared to justify your pricing, while at the same time being open to reasonable compromises. By mastering your negotiation skills, you will better navigate the tougher economic conditions, while still gaining mutually beneficial agreements.
Conclusion
In a recessionary environment, sales skills play a crucial role to the success of most building companies. By strategically prospecting and targeting specific markets, shifting to value-based selling, building trust and relationships, effectively handling objections, and adapting your negotiation techniques, you can better position yourself for success.
Furthermore, by making changes early and continuously honing your sales abilities, (and allowing time to learn), you will more confidently navigate the challenges that recession brings.
You may even not simply survive – but thrive.

Having a system that ensures everyone is on the same page work-wise means you don’t have to supervise the team the entire way through a process, boosting efficiency in time and resources as a result
After years in the industry, many small builders have developed specific processes for carrying out building tasks, from making sure every painted corner is lightly sanded (so the paint lasts longer) to measuring all the skirting lengths before starting to cut.
From their experience, builders are confident that following these processes improves efficiency and quality, so it’s frustrating when they take on team members who don’t follow suit.
This is a common issue for Successful Builder clients; many would prefer that their team members learn from their experiences and adopt the methods they’ve learned over the years, to avoid making the same mistakes. Having a standardised approach to tasks means everyone is on the same page, and ideally can work with less supervision.
How do you go about creating such a system? Do you need to hire an expert to produce a multi volume instructional handbook? Not really, even though it would be nice to have one do it all for you.
One of my clients told me he was spending huge amounts of time supervising his team while they were renovating bathrooms. There was good money in bathroom renovations, but the time it took supervising them ate up much of the profits and worked against his quoting on larger jobs.
To combat this problem, he used a straightforward method to create the ‘company bathroom manual’, which reduces the time he spent supervising.
I call it the ‘Post-it Note Method’. Here is how it works:
1. List all the steps
Gather your team and get them to list all the tasks involved in getting a particular job done. Use Post-it notes of one colour (eg, red) and get them to write each task on a separate note. Don’t worry about the order of the tasks, just make a point of covering all the steps in the job.
2. Organise locally
Stick the Post-it notes on a whiteboard. Arrange them vertically in the order that you would normally follow doing this job. If you need several columns, leave a gap for another column of notes.
3. Checklist points – stages
Every job has several points where it is good to check your work before proceeding. For example, you may want to check that your foundations are in the correct position before you pour the concrete. You might also want your team to check that frames are placed correctly and square before you fire up the Ramset! Or, using the bathroom renovation example, you may want to check the toilet bowl holder nogs are in before you put on the plasterboard.
These checkpoints are where it is possible to correct small errors, which, left unchecked, could have huge consequences down the track. These errors may only take a moment to correct now, but could prevent a costly rework later on. Some of these checkpoints may coincide with council inspection checkpoints, but not necessarily so.
Mark these checkpoints with a Post-it note of another colour (eg, yellow) and write the name of the checkpoint.
Stick the note on the whiteboard beside the appropriate task. You will create a note for each of these checkpoints.
This will ensure that when you start creating instructions, they will be directed towards achieving certain outcomes.
4. Create instructions
Now comes the fun part. Review your checklist to determine if there are any particular directions you would like your team to follow when carrying out the tasks in this stage, so that they do it your way. You are not creating the trade training manual here, just giving them the benefit of your experience. Give each list of instructions a name and write it on a Post-it note of another colour (eg, blue). Place these blue notes on the whiteboard beside the first task in each stage of the process.
You have now mapped out your ‘business’ system for this job.
5. Assign
Once you have created your Post-it note system, you may want to assign a team member to create each checklist(yellow) and each instruction list (blue). Explain your thought process about each and have the team member write it out, checking with you as necessary. This need not be complex – the simpler the better.
There is no need to include general building skills, as you only need to include the particular things you want done your way and the order you want them done.
Summary
Using the Post-it note method is a simple way to get your team involved in helping you overcome a time-consuming issue. By having them involved in setting it up, they are more likely to execute the job to your standard.

How do people in your region feel once winter hits? Do they ‘rug up’ against the cold leaking through poorly fitting windows, complaining about the shortcomings of their home while dreaming of a warm, dry, comfortable room where all the family gathers?
C hanges in the season bring changes to your marketplace. Being aware of these changes and positioning your business to best take advantage of them is a good way to get more work. Here are several things you can do to warm up your advertising in the coming winter months.
Get inside their head
Imagine how easy your advertising would be if you knew what your potential client was thinking. Say you knew that in July they dreamed of getting a more functional kitchen, so the family could enjoy creating winter meals together, or doing something about the sunless rear of the house.
On the other hand, what if you knew in August that as they climbed the ladder again to clean out the gutters, they were thinking, “I can’t keep doing this. We’ve got to resurrect that new home dream”.
If you knew these thoughts, your advertising message would be simple. In July you’d say something like ‘Is your kitchen no longer family friendly ? ’ and shape a message around kitchen remodeling. In August your line could be, ‘Here’s how to get started on that new house dream’, and outline how accommodating you are for people starting the process.
To best understand the needs of your customers, you need to put yourself in their shoes and get the feel of what it’s like living in their homes.
Try to imagine their feelings when they experience condensation running down the windows, or their frustrations when struggling to create a welcoming environment for family and friends or to accommodate a growing family.
Or sense the frustration of not knowing where to start with a new home project.
The better you can ‘sense’ what your potential clients are thinking and feeling, the easier it is to target a message that will be noticed.
Review your service offerings
Winter weather brings out the worst in houses. Summer inconveniences become obstacles in winter, indoor living accentuates the desire for space and cold nights accentuate poor design.
Some builders expect their business to slow down over winter, but people are still thinking about making changes to their homes – small and large – from immediate work on overdue maintenance now clearly obvious, to starting a major upgrade or a new build.
Winter can be a great time for growing your business, if you position yourself correctly. Maybe you accept a number of smaller jobs to keep the team busy. While these can be fiddly, if they are priced correctly (factoring in a higher share of management and administration costs), they can be a good source of new business.
At each new job, you also get an opportunity for low-cost advertising – you can erect your sign outside the property, drop flyers to homes in the immediate neighbourhood, ask for referrals from your new customer, gain a new testimonial and add your new customer to your database for future contact.
Powerful offers
When customers are ready to purchase, they will almost invariably do so from the company they think has the best to offer. However, what you offer goes well beyond simply what you can build.
You can also offer things that provide additional value for your customers at low cost to you, such as an upgrade or your availability to do the work now, or the quality of your workmanship and guaranteed back-up should something go wrong.
For example, “free installation” and, “free appliance upgrade” means that your customer gets more than s/he pays for. “Available now” means they get the benefits sooner. “Personal guarantee” means peace of mind, while “fully qualified and/or registered tradespeople” means an assurance of integrity and “25 years experience” suggests good advice and quality.
Think about what it is your target customer would consider as great value and come up with a list of offers you could make. Here are some suggestions:
FREE heated mirror with every bathroom renovation (ask your electrician to supply at cost).
SAVE $300 on specialist interior and colour consultation (ask your interior consultant to consider the reduction as a marketing cost against future work).
FREE lounge suite with every new home confirmed by November (look for an arrangement with a supplier who also supplies other homewares).
Invest in online advertising
There is no question that advertising online is powerful and that astute building businesses are growing their online presence.
While you can readily publicise your business on social media sites by uploading photos and videos of interest (a good place to start is Facebook and Pinterest), investing in and marketing a good website is essential to creating a great presence.
If you don’t have a website, make sure that you build one with a clear picture of your target customer (check out www.websitesforbuilders.co.nz for help, which is run by The Successful Builder’s digital marketing manager Felicity Owen).
Measure the results
Whenever you do any advertising, make sure that you measure the results. The best way to do this is to record the source of every new enquiry you get, after you have asked how they found out about you.
Analyse these at the end of every month (or quarter). I assure you that if you do this routinely, you will learn much about your business and your market. You will find out what works and what doesn’t, helping you save time, effort and money.

The end of the financial year can be a stressful time for business owners everywhere, but by following this simple guide, you can ensure all your affairs are in order
For many, 31 March marks the end of the financial year and it can sneak up very quickly, leaving you with a lot of work to do before sending your books to the accountant. There are many things to cover off and consider, but you can save yourself a good amount of time and pain by paying attention to the following.
As one of life’s great constants, tax is ever-present and needs to be on a business owner’s mind year round; the end of the financial year is no exception. The following tax payments are due in the two months after 31 March:
Terminal tax for the previous year (for taxpayers who have extension of time through their accountants) – due 7 April.
The third provisional tax payment and GST for the period ending March 2015 – both due 7 May.
It’s crucial you have a good handle on how your business has performed throughout the financial year.
This provides you with the perfect opportunity to speak to your accountant about tax – in particular, whether you have paid enough.
As the IRD charges companies 8.40% interest on any terminal tax amounts higher than $2,500, it’s critical to ensure that you have paid enough tax before it’s too late.
“As one of life’s great constants, tax is ever-present and needs to be on a business owner’s mind year round; the end of the financial year is no exception
If you’re operating as a sole trader or partnership in your first year of trading, a voluntary tax payment before 31 March can provide you with a much-needed discount on any terminal tax payments that may be due.
The IRD charges penalties and interest for any non-payment on provisional tax dates, where it deems payments should have been made. Therefore, if you pay the full amount of provisional tax on 7 May that you should have paid during the year, the IRD will still charge nonpayment penalties and use of money interest.
You can avoid this by utilising a Tax Pooling system and ‘purchase’ your tax at a lower rate of interest. This is something you should discuss with your accountant, particularly if you operate in a seasonal industry, or if you’ve won contracts that have significantly increased your bottom line during the financial year.
Have you been having problems collecting payments from some of your debtors during the year? If so, a quick review of your ledger to assess the collectability of the debts is an important part of the year-end process.
The IRD allows for tax deductions of uncollectible amounts – “bad debts” – only if they are removed from your debtor ledger before the end of the financial year. These removals may be reversed if the debt is collected unexpectedly at a later date; however, these recoveries need to be included as fully assessable income for tax purposes.
Make sure any tools than are broken, obselete or stolen are removed from your fixed asset schedule
Does your fixed asset schedule include any tools that are broken, obsolete, have been replaced or stolen during the period? If so, these should be removed from your fixed asset schedule. A tax deduction amounting to the written down value (cost less accumulated depreciation) can then be claimed.
Have you, or do you plan on, paying bonuses for the 2015 financial year? Employee benefits such as holiday pay and bonuses owing at 31 March can be claimed for tax purposes if paid by 2 June (within 63 days of the balance date). Bonuses must be finalised before 31 March in order to be claimed. Bonuses dependent on conditions satisfied after 31 March cannot be claimed.
While we’ve provided a number of areas to consider, there are many other areas that business owners need to focus on in the run-in to year-end. Balance date can approach very quickly, but by taking a step back from the tools and looking at the numbers, you can save yourself a lot of time and money.
If you do have questions about the end of the financial year, please contact Peter van der Heijden at peter.vdh@crowehorwath.co.nz ; or contact your local Crowe Horwath advisor.

Starting a business is a popular option for entrepreneurial Kiwi builders, but it pays to get the right support network together before you jump into it
It’s often the biggest move a builder will make, and yet is quite often the one that’s handled the worst. The apprenticeship is over, you’ve had a few years of experience, become a licensed building practitioner and you want to start working for yourself – where do you start?
The most crucial question any business person has to ask themselves is – where do I want to end up? The life cycle of any business (as shown on below) invariably follows the same course; and while some arrive at key points at different paces, the overall cycle remains the same.
Without an end goal in mind, even the best business ideas will meander along without achieving any great success, and the business owner may not be able to sell the business at the end of their working lifetime – which is not a great result for a lifetime of work!
The potential cost of simply shutting the doors on a business is immeasurable, especially if it had great potential and a strong name or customer base to be carried on by a new owner. Not to mention that any value built into a business at sale time is currently a tax-free capital gain! For these reasons, an exit strategy needs to be formulated at the same time as your entry strategy.
While visualising the end point is important, it is also critical to have the right advisors around you before you get too far down the track.
The first step any new business owner should take is to engage an accountant. Putting aside the statutory requirements of preparing financial statements and tax returns each year, the right accountant can often be your most trusted ally, and the key connection between the advisors discussed below. Any funding application with the input of an accountant on year-end financial statements, as well as forecasted results, will consistently have a better chance of achieving the funding that you seek.
“Without an end goal in mind, even the best business ideas will meander along without achieving any great success
They can also help you to set up your systems from the ground up (as highlighted in our June 2014 article), ensuring you have the foundations in place for a strong-performing business. Accountants can also take on the role of business coach, providing a valuable sounding board for any financial decisions that the business needs to make, as well as acting as a mentor to help you cover off the challenges that arise along the way.
Due to the inherent risk of working in the construction industry, you will need a lawyer at some point during your business’ lifetime. Rather than waiting for something to go wrong, it’s best to engage one right from the beginning. A lawyer who knows your business inside out, has a strong working relationship with you, and who can see any potential issues arising before they even register, can often be the difference between a hefty lawsuit and a minor inconvenience. They can also help you to structure your affairs correctly, so if the worst does happen, the impact on your personal assets (such as the family home) can be minimised.
Continuing along the advisor theme, the final piece in any business’ puzzle is liaising with a business banker to structure your affairs in the most advantageous way. Even if it just means you have a standard business banking account set up, the relationship that you form with your banker is one that will last for a very long time. They will enable you to make key decisions around the funding structure of the business; in particular, whether you will be funding this from your own pocket, or utilising banking finance.
Once you have your team in place, there are many other areas to cover, decisions to be made in the first year of operations and challenges to overcome. Should I draw a salary in the first year? How do I set my prices? Who are my customers? Should I set aside some cash for the tax bills I have coming up? Should I be employing some people to help me out? These are but a few questions that will arise in the first year of operating, and beyond.
All of these queries have considerable ramifications if you get them wrong, and not everyone has the expertise to answer every question on their own. It’s for these reasons that you need to build your team before you get too far down the track. The analogy of the ambulance waiting at the bottom of a cliff can be completely avoided if you have someone to lend a hand at the top.
Successful businesses, no matter what the industry, all have one thing in common – they have strong working relationships with the above three advisor groups.

Some people think that having more money going in to a business than going out equals profits; however, with tax being paid on top, it’s not that simple
Most business people will know that you can claim a deduction against your income for any business expenses paid for.
Major asset purchases, where deductions are claimed over the life of the asset, in the form of depreciation, are excluded. This leaves you with items such as material purchases, wages/subcontractor payments, legal and accountancy fees and so on.
As with anything in a tax return, the IRD can choose to review any claims made. Therefore, keeping good records is important.
One of the most easily missed deductions that a business can claim is expenses for a home office. Usually calculated based on the floor plan, you are entitled to claim a proportion of the household’s expenditure, based on the size of your office and/or workshop.
Claimable expenses include:
Rates.
Insurance.
Power.
Telephone bills.
Interest paid on a mortgage.
However, not all household items are deductible and the IRD is vigilant in this regard. If you’re unsure about what you can claim, it’s always best to talk to an expert.
Another area that contractors tend to miss is the upfront deduction they can make on purchased tools. As a rule, you can claim a full deduction for any tool purchased for less than $500.
Any item over that amount must be added to your fixed asset register and depreciated according to the IRD’s prescribed rates. While many contractors like to use their end-of-year accounts asset schedule as a guide for what tools they have, they’re costing themselves a considerable amount by capitalising items they don’t need to.
A much better alternative is to run a completely separate schedule of tools, in order to make accurate insurance claims (if necessary) and track how old a tool is or how long it has been held by the business.
Claiming a deduction for vehicle expenses is a fairly straightforward exercise; however, there are a few key areas for contractors to be aware of in order to ensure that they meet all requirements.
If you use your private vehicle for business use, you need to run a logbook for at least three months every three years to record distances travelled, dates and reasons for trips.
The distances used for business purposes can then be compared against the total amount of travel done, with expenses for the vehicle claimed on a percentage basis.
For example, if you travelled 100km for work purposes out of a total of 300km in a three-month period, you can claim 33% of the vehicle’s costs, such as petrol/diesel, repairs, insurance, etc.
If you’re claiming less than 25% as a business expense, you do not need to maintain a logbook. Bear in mind that the IRD may require you to show how you came up with the proportion that you have claimed.
“One of the most easily missed deductions that a business can claim is expenses for a home office. Usually calculated based on the floor plan, you are entitled to claim a proportion of the household’s expenditure, based on the size of your office and/or workshop
Alternatively, you can use mileage rates as prescribed by the IRD to make a claim for these expenses.
All expenses paid for vehicles owned by the business are claimable. However, if the vehicle is available for private use, an adjustment called Fringe Benefit Tax (FBT) must be paid to the IRD.
In this regard, it’s important to note the days that the vehicle was unavailable for private use – such as an overseas holiday. There is a general exclusion from FBT for ‘work-related vehicles’ that employees or shareholders store at home, do not use for private purposes and which meet the following four conditions:
The vehicle is not designed to carry passengers (ie, utes, vans with the rear seats permanently removed).
The vehicle has signwriting with the name of the employer/business logo on it.
The employer has notified employees in writing that the vehicle is not available for private use.
The employer regularly checks that employees are following the restriction noted above.
There are also additional exclusions for vehicles that are stored on an employer’s premises and vehicles over 3,500kg.
If you are concerned that you aren’t claiming the right amount of deductions, or that you may be accounting for your vehicle use incorrectly, or have any other questions about the topics detailed in this article, we can help. Please contact Peter van der Heijden at peter.vdh@crowehorwath.co.nz , or your local Crowe Horwath advisor.

How can you effectively plan in these unpredictable times? Business coach Graeme Owen says don’t make plans too detailed, focus on what can be done, and know what your ‘why’ is
You’ve heard the gurus say that you should set goals if you really want to get ahead in business and in life. That is all well and good when the future is predictable. But in these changing times, who knows what next year will bring?
You may have been able to plan with some certainty pre-Covid. But that same level of certainty hasn’t quite returned. However, all is not lost!
It just means that we need to adopt a method for setting directions and staying on top of things. I call these intentions and milestones. Get clear on your intentions. Then identify the next milestone. Rinse and repeat.
Here’s how it works.
1  Set intentions and consider fresh approaches
The way things are done is changing. There is no certainty that you can do business the way you used to. For example, recent events have provided a perfect opportunity for technology to penetrate our business practices – for handling pricing and quoting, communications, supplies, automation etc. If you stick with the processes you developed over the past decades, you may be left behind by those adapting to newer ways.
Further, complications in obtaining international products and materials may give rise to new, more local solutions. You may need to become familiar with substitutions you hadn’t considered before.
So, don’t get stuck in familiar approaches to tasks. Instead, identify what it is you need to do, then look for new ways to achieve that. Rather than hoping to return to what was (and note: the past always seems better than it really was) embrace some fresh ways of doing things. It’s always good to have different options. Don’t expect to be able to do everything as you once did!
This is a time to look for newer (better) ways of doing things. It may be the time to upskill on that software package you have been trying to avoid, but know you need! Or it may be the time to teach your builders to train the newbies.
Whatever it is, identify what you want to achieve and look for new ways of getting there.
2  Shorter timeframes towards milestones
At the moment, you can’t really cement the details of a long-term plan. So, quit worrying if you don’t have one written down. You still need to set targets, but just make the time frames shorter. Look for the milestones in between rather than aiming straight for the finish line.
In most small businesses a one-page 90-day plan is quite long enough. Especially when it focuses on tactical stuff.
A 90-day plan may only have the following three sections:
Your long-term intentions (eg, to deliver well-planned and affordable renovations to family homeowners in my locality).
Your strategies (eg, create a website that showcases family home renovations and master a couple of strategies so we will be found in online searches).
Some weekly task lists (eg, choose a web designer, get testimonials together, collate web materials, learn how to use Google ads, learn how to use Facebook, start posting on Facebook, start Google ad campaign etc).
The key here is to review your plan on a monthly basis and stick with it. However, when life happens and/or new opportunities come along, be prepared to revise your plan.
3  Focus Your Effort
Riverbanks determine where the water flows – unless it’s in flood and then the water overcomes the bank. Yet even a small flow can be quite powerful in one narrow channel. Just so, while most small businesses are constrained by outside factors, when such a business is concentrated on one thing, it can be quite powerful.
So rather than rail against the external things you can’t change (the riverbank), look for opportunities you can pursue (the channels) and focus your energy on these. You can’t change the banks, but you can select the channels. I often say to my clients: “Don’t tell me what you can’t do. Tell me what you can do. Then do that!”
Narrow down the focus of your business (the things you can do) and become a specialist in one key area. This is the way to increase your prowess in this particular skillset and become sought after and even more attractive to your potential clients.
4  Clarify Your Why
Living in unpredictable times is a new experience for all of us. The present uncertainties raise questions that demand answers.
Why are you making the effort?
Why are you taking the risk and staying in business?
Why do you do what you do?”
Questions like these challenge your fundamental reason for being in business. Yet when you can answer them in a way that motivates and excites you, you start to feel passionate about why you are in business. It creates an energy that others (new clients and team members) will want to be a part of. Because not many people answer the “why?” question.
So, why are you in business?

For World Autism Acceptance Month, the Building and Construction Industry Training Organisation (BCITO) and Altogether Autism are joining forces to encourage autistic people to consider a career in the construction industry
In partnership with Altogether Autism, BCITO is working to offer more support to employers, so they can take on autistic apprentices and understand the challenges they face.
One such BCITO apprentice is Todd Maitland, who works full time for Brownmore Concrete in Waihi. Todd has autism, an intellectual disability called ‘developmental delay syndrome’, and is blind in one eye – but none of that has stopped him.
As well as working as a concreter, he is vice-captain of the Whaikaha men’s basketball team, New Zealand’s first men’s team for high-functioning athletes with intellectual disabilities, which recently competed in Australia.
A welcoming industry
Rex, owner of Brownmore Concrete, said there’s always a job available in the trades for anyone, no matter what challenges they face.
“There are a lot of challenges that come with being an autistic person but, because we have things in place and people we can go to, they are only challenges, not barriers,” he said.
Rex supported Todd by creating visual learning tools, such as one to help him judge the size of mesh, and customised materials to help him understand the tasks he needed to do.
Todd, who nominated Rex for a BCITO Building Leaders award in November 2024, said his boss has been incredibly supportive.
“I’m a 19-year-old with autism, developmental delay syndrome, verbal dyspraxia and I am blind in one eye. Now, that’s a lot for any boss to take on – but not Rex, aka ‘Buddy’.
“He has encouraged me and pushed me to be the best version of myself since day one. He has helped me to become someone and not be looked at like ‘another special needs person’, but a worthy and useful part of my community.”
Building a strong industry together
BCITO Director Greg Durkin said that a career in the trades can be a viable option for everyone – and, as long as employers are considerate and willing to make small tweaks to workplace practices, they can benefit from hiring people from all walks of life.
“We want to encourage as many New Zealanders as possible to enter the trades, to help us build a strong construction industry that can meet our housing and infrastructure needs – now and in the future,” he said.
“This involves us reaching out to as many people in our communities as possible and supporting employers to create welcoming workplaces. We’ve seen many workers with neurological differences, physical disabilities and learning difficulties enjoy rewarding careers in the trades. Through this partnership with Altogether Autism, we’re working to support even more to take on apprenticeships through us.”
Catherine Trezona, National Manager of Altogether Autism, added that autistic people bring valuable skills to the workplace.
“Their strengths often include deep focus, reliability, loyalty and the ability to understand complex systems. Our mission is to raise awareness of the benefits to employers in hiring autistic talent.”
Employers who are interested in employing a neurodiverse staff member should contact Altogether Autism as a first port of call, as the organisation offers free advice on supporting individuals. Employers are also able to contact Andrew Green, Principal Advisor for Learners with Disabilities at BCITO, for help and advice on where to start at andrew.green@bcito.org.nz .

Don’t get stuck in a situation where you haven’t been paid for months but you can’t afford to stop working – use the tips below to ensure you have sufficient cash flow.
You’ve heard the story: what started as a dream job – large, challenging and profitable – has now become unbearable; your client has stopped paying bills on time, questions each and every line item and quibbles over your meagre margins; and, all the while, your overdraft is growing.
Clients like this can make the life of a small builder exasperating in any environment. In fact, it seems that every builder I’ve met has at least one such story to tell. But it doesn’t need to get to this point; it’s possible to organise your business so you’re paid on time, every time. Here are five financial disciplines that, when adopted properly, can help make non-paying clients a thing of the past.
Check over your agreements to ensure that your terms and conditions set out your invoicing and payment expectations, such as progress payments. Make sure that you have the right to stop work (and remove materials) if a progress payment is not made on time.
For example, if your normal process is weekly invoicing for payment of all costs incurred in the preceding week (labour, materials and subcontractors), make sure your agreements specify this process and stipulate when the payment is due. Also check that your terms and conditions state that “should payment be delayed, the costs of debt recovery will be added to any outstanding payments”.
While most building association agreements are excellent, they may need to be adjusted to suit your particular situation. Having your lawyer check over these is a worthwhile investment, as it’s better to pay them a small fee than incur substantial losses down the track.
Most people know how much a replacement tyre is likely to cost, so they’re not alarmed when the bill is presented. But most homeowners have no idea how much a renovation can amount to, particularly if there are hidden problems to fix.
To avoid causing your customers surprise and angst, check that a proposed job fits within their budget before incurring any cost in designing or pricing. You may not be able to give a fixed price, but in most situations you can use your best judgement and give a ball park figure (it helps to include a best and worst scenario). Listening carefully to their response can save you both time and money.
Furthermore, it’s worth enquiring whether or not a lender is involved, since this is likely to affect how and when you might be paid. Simply ask if there are any other parties involved financially. It pays to be sure about this because there is nothing worse than starting a job and not being paid the final amount because your client runs out of money, or a bank holds up payment.
It costs money to prepare free estimates and quotes and while these costs may be paid for by the profits from your jobs, this profit is not usually realised until after the client has made their final payment. Also, once an agreement is signed, it takes time and money to gear up a job – you may have to spend money recruiting new staff or purchasing new equipment.
Carrying these early costs for the duration of the whole job can affect cash flow and limit your purchasing power, so request a decent deposit.
To determine a fair deposit fee, make a rough calculation of the costs of project estimation and preparation, in addition to a fair proportion of the building and labour costs that will be incurred before the first payment is received. Try not to be your client’s bank.
It’s not unreasonable to expect payment on a weekly (or fortnightly) basis. Your client may believe that, because you have monthly terms with your suppliers, he/she should have the same arrangement with you. However, there is no requirement for you to do so.
Your arrangement with your supplier is a business-to-business relationship, built on your reputation and your credit history. You cannot afford not to pay your suppliers on time, as failure to do so will affect your ability to make future purchases. It may even close you down.
Your client’s arrangement with you is different. For them, it’s a ‘one off’ purchase and, if they don’t pay on time, it doesn’t threaten their income one bit – but it does threaten yours.
It’s completely acceptable – and should be expected – that your client pays you in a timely manner, so you can pay your team, suppliers and subcontractors in a timely manner as well. This should ensure the smooth financial operation of your business.
In my experience, unpaid variations are the single biggest reason for owner-builder disputes and builders losing money. Again and again, I come across builders who start on variations without getting their client’s authorisation “because it needs to be done”. While they’re allowed to carry out variations that need to be done, clients are allowed to refuse to pay for work they did not authorise.
While it might seem cumbersome, it is cheaper to take the time and effort to communicate with your client and get them on board (in writing!) before starting any variation.
While it might be possible to survive a bad paying client in good times, an astute builder makes use of the opportunity good times brings to review, strengthen and update client payment systems. It’s the disciplines adhered to in good times that enable a business to make the most of growth and survive tough times.

For many in construction, 15 January is when GST and provisional tax payments are due. While the timing of these payments can be problematic, there are a few simple things you can do between now and then to ensure you are ready to pay Inland Revenue what you owe
Two important tax payments – GST and the second instalment of provisional tax for the 2018 tax year – are due to Inland Revenue (IRD) on 15 January.
Coming just after Christmas and in the early New Year, the timing of these is not necessarily ideal as things are quiet on the work-front and cashflow can be tight. Getting hold of your accountant may also be difficult.
The IRD, however, will not take that into consideration if you don’t meet your tax obligations on time. In fact, it will come down hard, subjecting you to a high interest rate of 8.22% and late payment penalties. This can hurt.
The last thing anyone wants is to have the taxman breathing down their neck, especially as the department has become more vigilant after it uncovered high levels of noncompliance among tradespeople concealing part, or in some cases all, of their income.
Builders in Auckland, Christchurch, Queenstown and Wellington may be familiar with this crackdown, as these regions have been specifically targeted.
Below are some basic tips that will help you get tax-ready, as well as an option to pay provisional tax how and when it suits you.
Know how you are placed financially
Start by reviewing your books to make sure your records are accurate and up to date. This will provide an indication of your overall cashflow position.
Do a budget
Figure out what your outgoings are and ensure you have a plan to pay for these while you are off work. This is important, especially if it is going to be a few weeks before you start earning an income again.
Complete jobs early
The faster jobs are completed, the faster you can be paid. If possible, prioritise work that can be finished quickly, so you can bill clients and have money in the bank before taking your holiday.
Chase outstanding payments
Cast your eyes over your debtors’ ledger and see who owes you money. Find out if they can pay early. Maybe offer a slight discount to sweeten the deal, as this could make a significant difference to your bank balance.
See if you can pay other creditors later
This is not always ideal, but worth considering if meeting tax obligations is going to be difficult. The IRD is not so forgiving, but suppliers with whom you have a good working relationship may offer you leeway if you explain your situation.
Use a tax pooling intermediary for your provisional tax
If it comes down to a choice of having to pay GST or provisional tax on 15 January, prioritise paying GST to the IRD and use an IRD-approved tax pooling intermediary to sort the other.
Intermediaries give you the option of deferring the full amount of provisional tax due by letting you chip away at what you owe in instalments. The interest they charge is much cheaper than the IRD’s and they also eliminate late payment penalties.
Seek advice
If you have any concerns, chat with your accountant. After all, you pay them for their expertise. Any good adviser should be working alongside you to come up with a tax payment and cash flow management strategy, as well as recommending options that suit your business.
Paying tax is never ideal, especially if it falls due when you are on holiday or are experiencing cash flow constraints. However, like anything, the key is to be organised and have a plan. Spend a bit of time doing that and you will be ready to pay the IRD what you owe on 15 January.

The current economic climate isn’t just affecting business owners – your staff could be feeling the heat too! So, when they get into hot water, you can be an oasis of calm
While you likely accept that running a small building business comes with its share of challenges – not least the current financial environment – no-one really prepares you for the challenge of handling staff, who are also feeling pressures created by the economic situation. For example, they may be concerned about the security of their income and their ability to provide for their families.
To reassure and retain your team, you might want to ensure that your company is a positive environment for them – somewhere they can seek help should financial difficulties arise.
The following strategies could help you foster a positive work environment and support your team members, who may experience challenges in the months to come.
Transparency
If you are facing particular challenges at the moment, then talking to your team is important. They will probably have sensed it anyway. Let them know you’re facing these challenges together, that you have charted a clear path through (assuming you have) and that their support and effort is vital in overcoming it. Transparency builds trust and unity. Your team will respond to your honesty.
Communication
Encourage your employees to feel comfortable discussing financial concerns with you. You don’t need to be an expert counsellor – it can be as simple as listening to them with empathy. The discipline of listening will give you a clearer understanding of their challenges, and you will be better prepared to help.
What’s more, your attentive listening is a gift – it enables them to unload – and ’a burden shared is a burden halved’. You can reduce your team member’s stress by simply listening to them. Don’t underestimate the positive value of being a good listener. Let your team know that you (or another senior staff member) are available to talk (listen) about any difficulties they may be facing.
Many larger businesses have an Employee Assistance Programme (EAP) as part of their employee benefits package. These programmes provide confidential counselling for team members facing personal and financial issues. You could consider enrolling in one, or engage a counsellor to be available as needed.
Flexibility
Discuss flexible working arrangements with your team, such as adjusted hours, remote work options, or compressed work weeks. These adjustments can help team members manage their time and expenses more efficiently, get extra time with their families and even reduce their stress.
Several companies I’ve worked with have tried working four longer days and then finishing midday on Friday.
Another company schedules a long weekend every six weeks or so. They work four x 10-hour days either side of a four-day weekend to give team members greater flexibility without affecting the build schedule, which is especially useful around school holidays!
Education
As a business owner, you appreciate the importance of financial education, which is something your team members may have had very little of. So, think of ways you can provide resources to enhance their financial literacy. You might arrange some in-house sessions on budgeting, saving, and investment – with outside help if necessary.
By offering this support, you empower your team to make better-informed financial decisions that will improve their financial well-being over time. Not only is this good for them and their families, it will help them better appreciate your business challenges.
Pay
Regularly review salaries and pay rates to stay competitive in the job market and be prepared to adjust your prices if necessary. By keeping your rates competitive, you will not only retain good team members, you’ll attract talented people to join your team. Better to raise your prices little by little and keep good staff than discount to the bottom and carry the burden of constant recruitment.
Culture
Cultivate your company culture to be supportive and encouraging of all team members. Include statements in your company values that describe how you want your team members to respect each other, work together and deal with challenges. As these cultural points become part of everyday life on your sites, it will help team members identify early signs of struggle, so they can be there to assist a team member going through a hard time.
Recognition
Almost all of us like to be recognised and appreciated. It does something for us. Recognising hard work shows your appreciation. So, when your employees go above and beyond, make sure to acknowledge their extra efforts. This could be through bonuses, time off, or simply a personalised thank-you note.
Appreciating your team for their hard work and dedication can boost morale and create a more positive culture.
Take Away
As a small business owner, who is navigating tight financial times, staying positive and supportive for your staff is not only good for them but crucial for the success of your company. The well being of your team is a worthy investment in the success and longevity of your business.

Don’t know what to do with that blog tab on your website? This guide will put you on track to start creating content that will captivate your readers and get your phone ringing!
1  Create a table.
Create a table on a piece of paper with eight columns and nine rows – block out the top left-hand square. Alternatively, click this link to download a template we created – we’ve even put some ideas down to help get you started!
2  Topics
In the seven remaining spaces along the top row, list different areas that you work in. Keep these fairly general, such as renovations, kitchens, bathrooms, reclads, extensions, pop tops, outdoor areas, tiny homes, new homes etc.
3 Styles
In the remaining squares in the far-left column, list all the kinds of expressions or content presentation methods you can think of. For example, you might include the following:
Rant
This is something that bugs you about one of your listed topics, such as renovations. It could be that you are bugged by the shady builder who wins a renovation job because they underestimate the likely costs. Not only do you miss out, but the client ends up paying more than they expected. Once you have ranted, you can write a short snippet about a useful solution.
Q&A
This is a short question and answer session where you simply answer a question that you commonly get asked by customers. Simply state the question and develop your answer, it could be something along the lines of ‘Who should I talk to, to get an estimate of the likely cost of a renovation, so I can decide if it’s worth doing?’
You could answer this in three simple steps:
Get a builder’s estimate on initial suggestions before committing to high design fees.
Check the likely value of your property after the renovation is completed.
Decide if it’s important for you to stay in your area.
Expand briefly on each point above and you’ll have a completed blog post.
How to
This is an informative guide, taking your client through the steps of achieving something like a bathroom renovation without paying bucket loads!
Case study
Everyone likes a good story. Write about an interesting or challenging build you completed and talk about it from your client’s perspective. What were their concerns/frustrations? What actions did you take to resolve them? What was the outcome?
Be sure to ask your client’s permission before using their name or photos on your website.
Resource
This could be a checklist or a calculator. It might be an online communications programme you use to help your clients keep up to date with their build, or perhaps it’s a checklist to go through before deciding to renovate.
Mistakes
Write about common mistakes you see people make, such as not allowing enough cupboard or bench space in a new kitchen.
Keep it current
Inform your readers about something new in the industry; it could be anything from a product to a construction method to current design trends.
Offer
Just keep it very simple. If you have a special offer, you might like to let them know about it.
4 Fill in the gaps
Now write brief notes in each of the boxes. Using ‘Kitchens’ as an example, in the box under kitchens and in the row labelled Q&A, write a question you get asked about renovating a kitchen.
Do this for each of the boxes, it may take a little bit of time, but once complete you’ll have 56 topics that you could easily write about. That’s one a week for a whole year!
5  Video yourself
You may find that you are actually better at delivering a message via video rather than in writing. You could easily film yourself on your cell phone if you want to go in this direction. If you do, have some fun with it.
6  Schedule
Once you’re done, make a frequency plan for when you’re going to do each blog. The key is to keep your blogs simple. Don’t overwhelm yourself or your readers with too much information.
Just do it!

Starting a business after becoming qualified is often the biggest move in a builder’s career, yet it is often handled poorly. Our advice? Listen to the experts – it could be the best advice you get.
T he most crucial question any businessperson must ask themself is: where do I want to end up ?
Businesses’ life cycles (as shown in Fig 1) invariably follow the same course; and while some arrive at key points at different times, the overall cycle remains the same.
Without an end goal in mind, even the best business ideas will meander along without achieving any great success. That may leave the owner unable to sell the business – not a great result for a lifetime of work!
The potential cost to a business owner of simply shutting up shop is immeasurable, especially if the business had great potential and a strong name, brand or customer base to be carried on by a new owner. Not to mention that any value built into a business at sale time is currently a tax-free capital gain! For these reasons, an exit strategy needs to be formulated at the same time as your entry strategy.
Laying the foundations for success
While visualising the end is important, it is also critical to have the right advisors around you before you get too far down the track.
The first step any new business owner should take is to engage an accountant. Putting aside the statutory requirements of preparing financial statements and tax returns each year, the right accountant can often be your most trusted ally and the key connection between the advisors discussed further on.
Any funding application with the input of an accountant on year-end financial statements – as well as forecasted results – will consistently have a better chance of achieving the funding that you seek. They can also help you set your systems up and ensure you have the foundations in place for a strong performance.
Accountants can also take the role of business coach, being a valuable sounding board for any financial decisions that the business needs to make, as well as a mentor to help you cover off the challenges that arise along the business’ lifetime.
Due to the inherent risks associated with owning and operating a business, you will also require the services of a lawyer at some point. The best time to get one on board is right from the beginning, rather than waiting for something to go wrong.
A lawyer who knows your business inside out, has a strong working relationship with you, and can see any potential issues arising before they occur can often be the difference between a hefty lawsuit and a minor inconvenience. They can also help you to structure your affairs correctly, minimising the impact on your personal assets (such as the family home) should the worst happen.
Continuing along the advisor theme, the final piece in any business puzzle is liaising with a business banker to structure your affairs in the most advantageous way. Even if it just means you have a standard business account set up, the relationship that you form with your banker is one that will last for a very long time.
They will enable you to make key decisions around the funding structure of the business; in particular, whether you will be funding this from your own pocket or with banking finance.
One step at a time
Once you have your team in place, there are many other decisions to be made and challenges to overcome, such as:
Should I draw a salary in the first year ?
How do I set my prices ?
Who are my customers ?
Should I set aside some cash for the tax bills I have coming up ?
Should I be employing some people to help me out ?
All of these queries have considerable ramifications if you get them wrong and not everyone has the expertise to answer every question on their own. It is for these reasons that you need to build your team before you get too far down the track. The analogy of the ambulance waiting at the bottom of a cliff can be completely avoided if you have someone to lend a hand at the top.
Successful businesses, no matter what the industry, all have one thing in common – they have strong working relationships with the above three advisor groups.

With new regulation, sustained labour problems and supply lines that continue to be constrained, the construction industry faces many challenges. Graeme Owen from The Successful Builder shares ways you can navigate them
Our world is changing rapidly and having an impact on the ability to transact business. The construction industry is no exception. So here are four things to keep in mind to help you navigate a rapidly changing environment.
1. Keep well informed on business numbers
I come across many builders who are incredibly capable, intelligent and resourceful tradespeople. They ooze technical know-how for every component of a build, yet when I ask them about the critical business numbers, they don’t know!
In previous years, it may have been okay to be ignorant of commercial numbers and to run your business by the seat of your pants, leaving it to the accountant to sort out at the end of the financial year. But, when costs are changing on a daily basis, it is imperative to know the impact these changes are having to your business.
Say, for example, you had quoted a job at 4,000 hours and you pay your team members $45 per hour. The job would cost $180,000 (4,000 x $45\per hour). Say you marked up 33% to $59.85 per hour ($45 x 1.33) and quoted at $239,400 (4000 x $59.85). Then your expected gross profit would be $59,400 ($239,400 – $180,000). Now, if overheads are $30,000 then the net profit would be $29,400 ($59,400 – $30,000). That’s a healthy 12%.
But if halfway through the job your team resigns, and you can only sign new people at say $52 per hour, then your costs will be $194,000 ((2000 x $45) + (2000 x $52)) and your expected gross profit will have reduced to $45,400 ($239,400 – 208,000), leaving a net profit of just $15,400 ($45,400 – $30,000), a little over 6%! That’s a 50% decrease in net profit!
So, in a rapidly changing environment, you need to know the implications of any changes that occur during the time between quoting and completing a job. It may mean re-negotiating a contract, looking for fixed-price contract labour or avoiding fixed price contracts altogether.
You need to know your business numbers, so that you can make intelligent decisions.
2: Review schedules more frequently
Hold brief weekly team meetings with your key team members (or leaders) to review each and every build schedule.
Have them check that the actual hours expended are in line with the hours budgeted in your quotation or build agreement.
If the job is a fully charged up job, do not make the mistake of allowing the work to simply drag on, as this sets a dangerous precedent. Most clients believe that the finished price should be close to your initial estimate and that charge up is reserved for unforeseeable or unchangeable circumstances.
Achieving this assures you of great referrals. Endeavour to treat every job as though it is a fixed price job and aim to complete it in the time and budget estimated. Set weekly targets and help your team leaders achieve these. Of course, there will be variations and changes, so make sure you have a good system to record these in case the client asks what the additional charges are for – this is simply good business.
Review procurement lead times and subcontractor schedules. You want to be fully informed about delays or hold ups, so that you can intervene to smooth the workflow. In a rapidly changing environment, it is likely that you (or someone else in your company) will need to spend more time sourcing and confirming supplies and subbies.
3. Stay nimble
It’s important to plan long-term. Do it at regular intervals!
However, in a changing environment, you should consider your long-term plan as simply ‘the plan that you had at the time you wrote it’.
Things change and, when they do, your plan needs to change. If something needs changing, then change it!
Your team may feel that you are being inconsistent. So what ? You have the security of the company to consider and the livelihood of your team members to protect. There is nothing to be gained by sticking religiously to a plan that is out of date. Be courageous.
As Winston Churchill is reported to have said to a woman berating him for changing his position: “When the facts change, I change my mind. What do you do, madam ? ”
So plan long-term, but revise short-term. This is an important key to business survival in changing times.
4. Remain positive
As a business owner who employs staff, you are a leader in your community. One aspect of leadership is casting vision. By reflecting on your past, you learn that current challenges do pass and that your worst fears rarely eventuate. Even if you have made mistakes, you have survived and come back stronger. Take a moment to review your mistakes. Draw courage from your successes.
Builders are some of the most adaptable people – highly skilled at diagnosing and solving problems. You have a multitude of skills and experience.
So, remain positive – regardless of the challenge. Adapt and cast vision. Team members rise to a challenge when inspired by a positive leader.
And remember, change is the only constant.

Quit losing the sales that you should be getting for the wrong reasons
You’re a great builder and you know your stuff, but when it comes to winning jobs, you lose out – to a better looking or better presented company. Yet, their finished product is no better than yours (in some cases it’s not as good), and your price is about right. Does this happen to you? If so, read on!
So, why do they win the jobs? Do customers really get taken in by appearances and presentation? Perhaps unfortunately, or unfairly, the answer is often yes. However, this tendency isn’t limited to building clients. It’s likely something you do as well, either knowingly or subconsciously. For example:
Imagine you are purchasing a truck and choosing between two that are identical in every way except that one is covered in mud and the other is spotlessly clean. Which would you choose? Most likely you would choose the bright and shiny one – even though both have the same performance characteristics and you’ll get it dirty anyway.
There is no doubt in marketing – appearances can have a huge impact on purchasing decisions.
The truth is, we believe more of what we see than what we hear!
So, to help you even the odds, here are five things you can do to morph into that “bright and shiny” builder from whom your customers will happily purchase.
YOUR VEHICLE
Your vehicle doesn’t need to be new to create a good impression (in some areas a new vehicle may even give the wrong impression). But it does need to be clean, tidy and in good repair.
You see, your vehicle may be the first thing your prospect sees.
So, take a look at it now. Does it show you care? That you pay attention to detail? Or does it indicate indifference? Are bits missing? Are there dents unrepaired? [Now, of course, if your prospect is an off-roading fan, turning up in a dusty, battered and mean 4X4 may be just the thing! It’s often about knowing your audience but, if you’re not sure, it’s best to err on the side of caution and have you vehicle neat and tidy.]
So, make cleaning and checking your vehicles a weekly habit.
YOURSELF
If you work mainly on the tools, then you probably think of yourself as a builder. And you are – when you are on the tools.
However, when you are in conversation with your potential client, prior to starting any building work, they need you to be someone else!
At this stage they do not need a builder. What they need is someone who will help them ask the right questions and locate the right solutions. They need an advisor.
Moreover, because you are probably discussing their largest financial asset, they need to know you can be trusted! That you are a professional advisor.
If you talk like an advisor, but you look like a tradesman, they may not believe you. Your appearance could be getting in the way. If the clothing you are wearing gives the wrong impression, it can undo everything you say.
So, how do you present? How does a professional advisor dress? We recommend tidy pants and a button up shirt, or similar.
SALES MATERIALS
The only way your potential client can come to believe that you will do a quality job for them then (ie, in the future) is by observing the quality of the experience they have with you now – during your first meetings.
Your sales materials can say a whole lot about what they can expect. Poor quality materials could suggest that you might be happy to accept a lower-quality standard of workmanship. On the other hand, excellent quality materials could suggest a higher-quality standard of workmanship. This is not necessarily true, but the sales process can often be affected by perception.
So, check out your brochures and forms, and make sure they are assets that you are proud to present.
QUESTIONS
Some inexperienced building company owners act as though over-talking about their company and its services will convince potential clients to purchase. Experienced building company owners simply ask a series of carefully thought out questions, that lead to a clearly defined problem for which a solution can then be found.
The thing is, good questions unlock imagination, and imagination is best expressed visually.
When you have asked good questions you can produce a visual rendition of some possible solutions. This is much more powerful than simply taking notes and verbalising the solution. Whereas if you do not visualise, then your idea of the solution may be quite different to what your potential client imagined. You may think you have heard them clearly, but until you produce a visual representation, it’s unlikely you’ll really know.
So, ask and sketch, ask and sketch until you start finding your potential client saying “yes.” This will demonstrate that you are a problem solver and help you win the job if you want it.
Once the visual is underway, keep the interaction going with questions like these:
“Is this what you had in mind?”
“Can you picture this plan working?”
“If we could build something along these lines, would that achieve your vision?”
PUNCTUALITY
There is nothing that dents your potential client’s opinion of you more than having them stare at their watch, waiting for you to turn up. Or having them wait while you finish with someone else, or (worse still) talk on the phone!
In western culture it’s courteous to be a couple of minutes late, but it is rude to be much longer.
So, to ensure you start off on the right foot, make sure to show up on time for meetings.
Takeaway: Remember, how you treat your potential customer during the sales process is important, as it forecasts how you will treat them during the build. How you act now shows them how you are likely to act then.

With demand for skilled labour increasing, it’s important to think outside the box when trying to bring some on board
Demand is increasing and my building business is growing. But when I advertise for builders no one applies!
Sound familiar? The Christchurch rebuild, earthquake strengthening and leaky homes have created a construction boom. However, it’s not easy to find qualified builders! In this article, we look at six simple things you can do to get more skilled builders.
Imagine you’re throwing a party and you want lots of people to come – do you just post it on your town’s events page? Of course not, you also contact everyone you know. Yet, when looking for skilled staff, most people doing the hiring feel it’s sufficient to post an advert on an online job board. The responses aren’t always what you’re hoping for.
While job boards can work, they only reach those people who are actively looking at a particular moment in time. Global surveys tell us that only 25% of people are actively looking for a new job at any one time. However, an astonishing 60% are passively looking and open to talking about job opportunities! This suggests that more than one in every two builders is open to looking for a new job.
So, how do you target these builders? Here are six things you can do:
It’s common knowledge that talented people know talented people, so look inside your own network. What skilled builders do you know? Chances are they’d be happy to hear what you have to offer and, even if they don’t take you up on it right away, they’ll likely keep you in mind.
Even if you don’t have a job offer right now, it’s great to keep in contact with talented people and keep the door open for opportunities when they come up.
Ask them to tap into their own networks. They might have friends who would jump at the chance to work alongside them. Most importantly, it will speak volumes if you can get your employees recommending your company as a great place to work. People tend to place far greater emphasis on word-of-mouth than on glossy advertising. You may also find out how your employees feel about working for you.
This is a list of skilled builders you’ve come across and would like to employ one day. Contacting them whenever you have a need can save you countless hours – and it costs you almost nothing!
For your list to be of use, you need to keep it warm by keeping in touch with them. Let them know that you’ve identified them as a talented builder and you’d like to keep in contact for any future job opportunities you may have. Then, touch base every six months or so to see how their career is going and if their goals are changing. It’s a similar strategy to service providers who call the same company bi-annually, knowing they have another service provider, just to see if things have changed. With your ‘Pipeline of Talent’ list, take a more colloquial approach and also use the opportunity to talk about the successes you’ve having as a company – but keep it brief!
“Think about what makes you a unique employer and make a list of what you can offer that other companies don’t
For example: “Hi Bob, we met at last year’s conference and I was impressed by your skills and your attitude. Although we don’t have any openings in Best Builders at the moment, I’d like to keep you on my record of talented builders. This way we can keep you aware of any future job opportunities we may have here…”
It’s a competitive market and there is a war for talent, so your strategy must be competitive. Think about what makes you a unique employer and make a list of what you can offer that other companies don’t. Remember, it doesn’t necessarily need to be more money – weekends off can be a luxury in times of skill shortages, when employers are stretched for staff.
People are often looking for opportunities to progress and develop, so it’s important to consider how your job can contribute to their skill set. Studies tell us that 90% of real learning comes from experience and working alongside others, so highlight some of the interesting jobs you have done recently – or describe some of the people they will be working alongside.
Apprentices may seem like hard work but, given the right training, they can become loyal and skilled team members. Remember – hire for attitude: train for skills. An apprentice with the right attitude will fit into your team and be willing to go the extra mile to achieve success.
Just because the industry could do with more builders does not mean you need go without – and don’t panic just because your adverts may not be getting great responses. Instead, focus on making your company attractive to highly skilled builders, then adopt strategies that put you in touch with the ones not actively looking for work.

Having health and safety protocols isn’t the same as protecting oneself from consequences if there are accidents in the workplace. Prosecution by WorkSafe over injuries could harm your business, so Ben Rickard of Builtin Insurance explains how statutory liability insurance can offer protection
In the year to August 2020, the construction industry was second for injuries that resulted in more than a week off work. There were 5,070 incidents. That’s over 100 per week!
WorkSafe prosecutions in construction
In 2020, there were nine prosecutions of construction firms by WorkSafe, with combined fines imposed of $259,000.
The prosecutions in 2020 ranged from the electrocution of a scaffolding worker to breaching a WorkSafe prohibition notice relating to asbestos. A case that concluded in early 2021 saw the company found guilty when a worker died after being hit by a falling beam. Another case in 2020 saw a $50,000 fine imposed for breach of a prohibition notice, despite no-one being injured. In fact, there were multiple prosecutions in 2020 for breaches that involved failures to observe a prohibition notice but without an actual accident.
In another prosecution, fines of $26,000 were imposed after a mini crane collapsed but the Person Conducting a Business or Undertaking (PCBU), did not preserve the scene or notify WorkSafe of the notifiable event. They simply arranged for the removal and replacement of the collapsed crane overnight and then continued working. It was a member of the public who witnessed the crane collapse that called WorkSafe. The fines related to failing to preserve the site and failing to notify WorkSafe.
Statutory liability
You cannot insure for health and safety fines; however, statutory liability insurance will cover the investigation and legal defence costs and any reparations awarded to an injured party or their family. These last two can often be the most expensive parts of the whole process.
As an aside, statutory liability insurance covers fines in other legislation, such as those in the Building Act, Resource Management Act and Fair Trading Act. In a recent prosecution, a building company was found guilty of misrepresentation under the Fair Trading Act when their initial estimate of build costs was found to be substantially lower than the eventual quoted price. If they had had statutory liability, it would have covered the cost of that fine.
PCBU responsibility wide-reaching
The High Court has clarified that a business does not need to be contractually tied to an activity to have health and safety responsibility as a PCBU.
The coverage of the Health & Safety At Work Act is very broad, as was demonstrated by a case where the demolition of a house in 2017 went badly wrong. During the work, a wall fell onto a neighbouring house, damaging it and rupturing a gas line (WorkSafe later prosecuted Quick Earth Moving Limited; you may remember the video!).
While the demolition company pleaded guilty, a second company that expected to project manage the work later was also charged. This second company had no contractual ties to the demolition company when the event happened. It had fenced the site and arranged for the services to be cut off. The District Court found in favour of the company, but WorkSafe appealed to the High Court and won. The High Court found that a business does not need to be contractually tied to an activity to be a PCBU in relation to it. The question was more if the second company was actually managing or supervising the work, with or without a contract to do so.
This decision highlights that even a business that is only involved in a small way in work that causes serious injury or death might still get caught in the WorkSafe prosecution net.

The demand for housing is growing, and not just in Auckland. However, growth presents a challenge when it comes to finding skilled staff – so how do you attract the best people?
T he Hays Quarterly Report (2016 Q1 ) predicts that skilled foremen will continue to be in short supply throughout this year. Skilled foremen are critical to a building company’s ability to manage more projects.
The law of supply and demand suggests you should offer the highest salary to ensure you get the people you need on your team, but it’s not that simple: you want people who are worthy of the additional cost. The following guide will help you attract the best people to your business.
Create big opportunities
When Steve Hansen became head coach of the All Blacks in 2012, his vision was to win the rugby world cup again in 2015 – something that had never been achieved before, making it a history-making opportunity. I suspect his vision attracted great players to join him in the quest.
If you want to attract the best people, you need to offer them opportunities – not just big salaries. Put yourself in an applicant’s boots by asking the following questions:
What is the career progression ?
Where are the opportunities for advancement ?
What training is on offer ?
What challenging jobs are coming up ?
The best people – who will add the most value to your company – are more likely to apply for jobs that offer them the best opportunities.
Tell your company’s story
The Hays report noted that candidates are not just interested in higher salaries or career pathways, but also in the company itself. Although they may not say so in as many words, they want to know who you are, what you’ve done and how you’ve managed your business. Just as people buy from people they like, employees want to join a company with a respected history.
Tell candidates your business story. Are you a young company focused on renovations or are you an established company with 20 years of experience – let your prospective employees know.
Highlight your company’s culture
Experienced tradesmen are in high demand, so they don’t need to stay with a company that doesn’t suit them. That’s why showcasing the culture of the company is important – few people stay in a situation that’s a poor fit.
One builder I know highlights the fact that everyone in his team is mad about outdoor pursuits. They don’t work weekends because that’s when they’re going hard out cycling, running, skiing, etc. A candidate wanting weekend work would be out of luck with this crew.
Tell prospective employees about your workplace culture; let them know what it’s like to work in your company. If you’re not sure, ask your current staff. What do you stand for ? What are your non-negotiables ? What’s common about your team ?
Showcase your uniqueness
Isolate your areas of specialty. Trying to be all things to all people often results in you being nothing specific to anybody. So promote your strengths:
What is your company really good at ?
What do you do really well that sets you apart from others ?
What is it about your company that makes you proud ?
Great employees want their efforts to achieve more than just a pay packet – they want to make an impact. Different companies do that in different ways.
For example, one company I work with challenges its staff to volunteer for community projects overseas and contributes to costs.
Look further afield
Some of your prospective candidates will be down the road at Bob’s Building Business, but in a tight market attempting to poach from your building colleagues might not suffice. You may have to cast your net in unfamiliar waters.
The Hays survey found that there was much interest from candidates in Germany, France, the UK and Canada. Be open to candidates from abroad, because most of New Zealand’s best local talent may already be employed. Recruiting overseas does take longer and has some challenges, but they aren’t insurmountable.
Get beyond titles
Finally, avoid merely focusing on job titles. Instead, detail the tasks that need doing and look for the people who have the talent to do what needs to be done. You might be surprised at where your next leader comes from; some of your best talent could be right there in a young apprentice, just waiting for the opportunity to prove his ability.

Do you have difficulty keeping up with your tax obligations? By taking a few simple steps to better manage your cash flow, you can ensure you’ll be prepared the next time the taxman comes knocking
Managing your cash flow throughout the year can be one of the most difficult factors in business success. Just when it appears that you’re getting on top of the cash situation, another tax bill comes along and you’re back to square one.
While tax cannot be avoided; cash flow can be managed with a few simple tips.
Many of our clients find setting up a separate bank account for tax payments a simple solution to avoid being caught out by a bill from the IRD. They put money aside each month for an estimated income tax bill and only dip into the account when provisional or terminal tax dates roll around. Using this method, you should put aside 28% of your monthly taxable income (for simplicity’s sake, your income less expenses).
This can also be useful for any substantial GST payments you may need to make; for example, large one-off transactions that lead to a higher than usual GST bill. In this case, it’s wise to take the 15% of GST received on the large receipt, and keep it aside to cover the payment that is coming down the track.
If you make a loss in a month, don’t withdraw any cash or add to the balance. If the loss situation continues for a few months, it may be time to re-evaluate the amount you’re setting aside.
A similar issue can arise for businesses that suffer from seasonal peaks and troughs – the IRD does not offer a respite for those who are in profit at the end of the year end but haven’t paid tax on provisional tax dates; this places further importance on the strength of your budgets for the full financial year.
If you face these sorts of issues on an annual basis, talk to your accountant about how you can avoid this from happening.
While this seems relatively simple, it’s absolutely crucial that you do not dip into this account during the year – barring any catastrophic downturns in your business performance. If you do, you’re simply shifting the issue and, if you cannot meet your payment obligations, you‘ll be charged interest and penalties by the IRD.
An upside to using this method, if you use an interest-bearing account, is that you can essentially swap around the situation you face for underpayment!
Another option, usually limited to income tax payments, is to utilise the services of a tax pooling intermediary to finance or top up any underpayments.
The key to tax financing is in its name – you effectively request an amount of tax to be paid to the IRD on your behalf. The finance contract operates as you’d expect, with repayment times and interest rates offered by the provider. The interest is paid as an up-front fee and is the only cost in the arrangement; the full tax amount is then paid at the chosen maturity date.
This allows you to effectively manage your cash flow while paying your tax. Although you are paying interest on the tax payment, you will avoid penalties (as long as you pay the right amount) and the interest is lower than that charged by the IRD.
In this case, you can apply to the tax pooling intermediary to top up your underpayment to the level that has been assessed by the IRD, in effect ‘purchasing’ the underpaid amount. Similarly to the tax financing option, you end up paying a lower rate of interest to the provider than you would to the IRD. You will also avoid any late payment penalties.
While this is a more reactive measure, it can also be the more realistic option because it’s hard to accurately anticipate your tax payments. Tax purchasing can often lessen the impact of tax during your more successful years, lowering the interest amounts paid by up to 30%. For this reason, if we have any clients with terminal tax payments due, we recommend they use a tax purchaser instead of paying the IRD directly.
As with all tax situations, there is never a simple answer but any of the above options can help you save yourself a bit of grief. More importantly, you can help your business’ cash flow thrive where it has previously faltered.
If you have questions about how to manage your tax payments and cash flow, or have any other questions regarding tax purchasing or financing, please contact Peter van der Heijden at peter.vdh@crowehorwath.co.nz; or contact your local Crowe Horwath advisor.

Future planning is key for any business. However busy you get day to day, working to meet short-term deadlines, it’s important to set aside time to think about what position you want your business to be in, in say one, five, or even ten years’ time.
If you’re planning to retire, or simply sell up to pursue other avenues, you want to ensure you leave your business in the best shape possible – a profitable, well-run outfit that offers an attractive ongoing concern to potential buyers/investors.
There is a proven approach to help reach that goal – create a process.
You can ‘future proof’ by improving your business processes. This will not only help realise a greater return when you choose to exit and sell, it will improve revenue on an ongoing basis up until that point. So, where do you start?
A Business Health Check is a method of assessing the current health of your business and what may need to be done to get it on a sound footing. This is th efirst step of future proofing – a bit like taking your car for its WoF.
While it’s possible for you to complete your own Business Health Check, it’s also helpful to establish a Business Advisory Panel to provide an independent assessment.
In large company structures, the CEO, senior management team, board of directors and possibly shareholders will work together to assess the state of the business and plan for the future.
However, most building companies in New Zealand are small to medium-size enterprises (SMEs). Often, one or a small number of people can be the shareholders, directors and part of the management team. This sometimes makes it harder to step back and look at your business objectively from various viewpoints.
That’s where a Business Advisory Panel can come in handy. This comprises a set of independent, professional service providers, who can help you take stock of your business’ health by providing an unbiased perspective, as well as providing access to independent skills in areas such as governance, strategy and best practice.
These professional service providers could form your Business Advisory Panel:
Your accountant can advise on the value of your business.
Your lawyer can ensure that you have the right contracts signed up and that your business meets current compliance requirements.
Your banker can help you protect your assets and fund further growth.
Your business coach can help balance your priorities and clarify your goals.
Once the health of your business has been assessed and areas for improvement have been identified, the next step is to set up a Business Enhancement Plan. This represents all aspects of a business in the form of a chart. The chart indicates potential focus areas for such a plan.
In essence, this is about fine-tuning your business practices – not necessarily a major overhaul. Usually this is a combination of improving revenue, reducing costs, increasing productivity and improving quality.
You’ll be surprised how even the smallest of improvements to your bottom line can improve the value of your business over time.
This plan is also about ‘de-risking’ your business, by having sound business practices in place.
Once the plan is in place, ensure your whole team knows what needs to be done and who is going to do it. This is very much a team effort, so you need to communicate your plan and get buy-in from everyone in the business for it to succeed.
Improvements can be measured, so you will know if you are on the right track. Effective follow-through is a critical factor in the success of such endeavours. Again, your Business Guidance Panel can greatly enhance your effectiveness in implementing, tracking and managing the Business Enhancement Plan and preparing for succession and exit.
The Venn Group provides the opportunity for you and your business to benefit from the insights of a team of independent specialists in enhancing the effectiveness and efficiency of small and medium enterprises. If you have any questions about the above issues, or would like to discuss this article in further detail, please contact Tony Hocking via tony@venngroup.co.nz, Tim Wilde via tim@venngroup.co.nz or Peter de Valda via peter@venngroup.co.nz.

TITLE   : Insulation installation

Everyone these days understands how important insulation is for the warmth and comfort of homes, and the health of families living in them. What’s less well known is that poorly installed insulation decreases effectiveness significantly
Gaps and uneven laying allow warm air to escape. The Building Research Association of New Zealand (BRANZ) found that R2.8 insulation with 16mm gaps would only perform as well as R1.4 insulation.
Even 4mm gaps reduced the R-value by 12-15%. Customers paying for quality insulation will not get the full benefit if it is not properly installed.
If insulation is badly laid throughout the house, it may not end up meeting the energy efficiency requirements of the Building Code, even if the correct R-value materials are used.
An audit undertaken for EECA (the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority) of insulation installed in newly built homes provides worrying reading. None of the installations, in their audit of 58 houses, met the requirements of New Zealand Standard NZS 4246:2006 Energy Efficiency – Installing Insulation in Residential Buildings .
This standard provides a best practice guideline to installing insulation in order to achieve good thermal performance and can be downloaded for free on the EECA website.
The audits found typical problems affecting thermal performance were:
Folds.
Tucks.
Gaps.
Compressions.
Missing insulation.
A lack of insulation to the middle of the top plate.
Other issues with installation included the lack of a 25mm gap to the underside of the roof underlay, which has the potential to transfer condensation and moisture to the insulation; as well as significant safety faults through insulating over, or around, recessed down lights and electrical equipment.
These photographs show typical installation problems from a range of houses. Using a high-quality insulation product with a high R-value is important – no matter which product you use, installation is the key to good performance.
The Insulation Association of New Zealand has been formed to encourage better performance in the supply and installation of residential insulation throughout New Zealand. The Association has developed a programme offering industry-specific training in site safety and on the requirements of NZS 4246:2006 .
To get the best-quality installation for your clients, consider using a graduate of their training programme. You can find the names of graduates on the IAONZ website ( www.iaonz.co.nz )
Alternatively, if you prefer to install insulation yourself, consider undertaking the IAONZ training programme – you may be surprised how much you learn about this important aspect of the builder’s craft.
The better the installation, the better the return for your clients in lower power bills, and the warmer and cosier they will be in their new home. All part of the quality build process.
Only insulate when the moisture content of timber is less than 16%.
Fit insulation closely to framing – there should be no gaps around the outer edges of the segments and framing, or between butted joins.
Make sure there are no folds in the segments themselves.
Make sure there is no tucking.
Insulation material should not be compressed – it will not perform to its best.
Insulation materials should be dry and undamaged.
Leave a clear space of at least 25mm between the insulation and roof or roof underlay.
Leave clearances around recessed downlights, unless they have an IC (insulated contact) rating.
Leave clearances around auxiliary control equipment, metal chimneys and flues.
For wall insulation, check out the Guide for Retrofitting Wall Insulation by EECA and MBIE – download from www.eeca.govt.nz/resource/guide-retrofitting-wall-insulation

Taking time to think of good things that have happened can have a huge impact on us. It can lift spirits and produce a positive change in a workplace, says Graeme Owen from The Successful Builder
R esearchers from the University of California, Davis had a group of people keep a daily written journal. After several weeks, those who recorded what they were grateful for experienced dramatically better physical and mental results than those who either wrote about negative experiences, or just wrote about anything. Moreover, they were more physically active and got sick less often.
It seems that just by thinking and writing positive things, we can re-wire our brain to serve us better and re-learn new ways of thinking! What’s more, we can learn ways of thinking that can help us experience life differently.
For many of us, the last few years have been defined by struggle, pressure, hardships and change. Will the next years be more of the same ? Who knows! I don’t, but I do know that whatever the next year holds, by practising gratitude, you can have more control over how you, your team and your family experience it.
So, here are four tips to embed gratitude into your business.
1. Switch Gears
Builders are experts at casting a critical eye over a job and noticing when something is missing, out of plumb or poorly aligned. It’s an essential trade skill for delivering a great product.
However, when it spills over into all other areas and becomes a negative and critical perspective on everything and everyone, it can be destructive. That’s when we need to switch gears mentally and shift from being critical – always searching for what’s wrong – to being more focused on what is right.
Not many people want to work with someone who is continually grouchy!
2. Give Praise
If you lead a team and want to get the best out of them, then give them heaps of praise for things they have done well. How can you help set them up for success ? Set tasks and goals that are achievable, give clear written instructions so they can complete the job satisfactorily and then give them credit for what they have completed – before discussing any areas where they have not achieved.
When discussing poor workmanship, mistakes or rework, encourage them to come up with solutions first. Compliment them for their attempts and, when showing them how to do something your way, congratulate them when they ‘get it’.
Praise teaches others to focus on what they can do and unlocks their brain to search for even better solutions, whereas criticism produces resentment and stalls action.
Giving praise also teaches our brains to look for the best in situations. That has to be good.
Plus, people love working for people who bring out their best.
3. Say Thank you
It’s amazing how good we feel when someone says ‘thank you’ for something we have done or said. It makes us want to do even more, doesn’t it ?
So, if you find yourself not saying thank you, then make a concerted effort to do so. Crank up your appreciation of those who do stuff for you. Thank the sales assistant at your suppliers. Thank your subbies for turning up. Thank your team for staying until the end of the day or working a little longer to get something finished.
Thank your life partner for contributing to your life. Thank your kids for putting up with you when you have been under the pump. And don’t forget to celebrate your own accomplishments each day. Appreciate yourself and all that you do to keep your business going – especially in difficult times!
You see, being thankful is a way of training yourself to expect good things to happen. Furthermore, when you expect good things to happen, you are more likely to approach each day with confidence in your ability to do what you need to.
People like being around confident people.
4. Make Notes
Take it a step further and start acknowledging what you are grateful for on paper. Find at least one thing each day that you are grateful for and write it in your journal. Do this consistently for two weeks and then check out where your thinking has been transformed the most. You might be surprised!
If you wish, you can extend this to your family. Each time something good happens to a family member, write it down on a slip of paper with the date and put it in a gratitude jar. Then every so often (monthly or at the end of the year) open the jar and celebrate the good things that have happened to you as a family. And then start looking for the good things that are going to happen in the next month/year.
Takeaway
The thing is, if we can learn to practise gratitude, we can rewire our brains to see the positive rather than the negative. When we do so, our entire body – attitude, feelings, emotions, capacity to enjoy life, sense of freedom, physical and emotional health – will improve along with our change in perspective. These changes can have a positive impact on a company’s culture.
So, rewiring our brains through gratitude could be a worthwhile practice. Wouldn’t you agree ?

Collecting money from clients over the summer holiday period is not an uncommon problem for builders because many people switch off from paying their bills over that time
I know builders who dread coming back from summer holiday, because it often means huge bills and an empty bank account. How many times have you had to organise a loan just to get you through January?
Below are four simple steps you can take to ensure you don’t get caught short on your own holidays.
Business owners the world over find it hard to talk to clients about paying overdue accounts. It comes from feeling indebted to them and it’s understandable. Yet most builders I know want to be able to pay their bills on time! They don’t want a bad credit record, nor the reputation that goes with it.
Most people don’t want to damage their own credit rating either, so rather than fearing your clients, help them protect their excellent credit rating by expecting them to pay on time; if they don’t, they may lose their rating.
This assumes you have clear payment terms and conditions included in your signed agreements, outlining the steps that will be taken should accounts not be paid. If you don’t, take steps now to put these in place for the future.
Include the agreed payment date on the invoice and send a polite email on the due date to remind them. If it’s not paid, then follow up in a couple of days with another reminder. Tell them that, if there is a problem, they should contact you immediately.
If you are using an online financial package (eg, Xero) you may be able to utilise an add-on application that tracks invoices, sends reminders and even follows up defaults (eg, Debtor Daddy).
This may not get a really stubborn payer to act, but it will ensure that your invoices stay at the top of the pile.
“If you’re working on a job where variations are a possibility (eg, a renovation) and your client is going on holiday, make sure you gain their prior approval for a variation process that enables work to continue
More than 50% of invoices rejected the first time are turned down because they’re not accurate. Not only are inaccuracies time wasters, they give your client the impression you can’t be trusted with finances. As a result, your client may feel compelled to go through and double check all of your invoices in case of mistakes.
Protect yourself from delays by making sure your invoices are accurate, clear and easy to read, and double-check them before hitting send. Don’t try to get something (eg, an unauthorised variation) past your client by hoping they won’t see it.
It’s better to discuss any questionable items with them first, so there is no room for disagreement. Overall, the goal is to remove all possible reasons for ‘justifiable’ delays and get paid on time, every time.
During the holiday period, when there may be limited access to clients and you or your builders identify the need for a variation, there is a huge temptation to go ahead without authorisation. However, doing so may result in a disputed invoice and a delayed payment. This is not good at the best of times, but certainly not good when cash flow is stretched during the holiday period.
If you’re working on a job where variations are a possibility (eg, a renovation) and your client is going on holiday, make sure you gain their prior approval for a variation process that enables work to continue. It may be that you gain written permission to make variations up to a certain value, or that you agree to document the problem with photos etc, and email them your solution, with their agreeing to reply within a certain time frame. Or you may agree to appoint a proxy.
Take care to only do work you’re sure you will be paid for.
Getting your clients to pay their accounts on time over the holiday season starts with you. Get your financial processes in place and operating smoothly during the year, so that, in the holiday season, it’s simply business as usual with only a few minor modifications.
Enjoy your summer holiday without wondering whether your bank account will be empty upon your return

Wasting time and money on lost quotes is frustrating. Here are some winning tips…
When you lose out on a job you’ve quoted for, it can reinforce the (mistaken) opinion that best price wins. It’s a mistaken opinion because the results of BRANZ’s 2012 New Home Owner’s Satisfaction Survey showed that only 13% of respondents said lowest price was important when choosing a builder! Perhaps unsurprisingly, those who stated that the lowest price was an important feature had the lowest satisfaction scores in the majority of aspects. Over 75% of respondents selected quality/reputation as the most important feature when choosing a builder.
So, here are five ways to improve quoting success.
“This looks really good. Thank you very much. I’ll just need to run it past my business partner/husband/wife/lawyer/uncle etc…. We’ll get back to you.”
You’d probably be rich if you got a dollar every time you heard this. It’s frustrating (and rightly so), because you wasted hours preparing and presenting to the wrong people.
You need to negotiate with the actual decision-maker(s) for an opportunity to explain the details and negotiate last-minute changes. At the very least, you are saved the wait of hoping they will call.
Stories from builders suggest that the builder who is with the client when they are making their decision is most likely to win the job.
So, in your very first meeting, explain your quote process and identify who will be making the final decision. Set a close-off date for all other quotes and gain agreement to be with them when they are making their final decision (to ensure they are comparing apples with apples). Do this every time and you will improve your chances of securing the job.
Maybe you’ve been trumped by a second-rate builder with a less than adequate quote. It happens! Your client may talk about better price, but the truth is they decided on emotion. People make a lot of decisions on emotion!
“You need to negotiate with the actual decision-maker(s) for an opportunity to explain the details and negotiate last minute changes
You don’t believe me ? How hard did you have to persuade yourself to buy that 51” TV ? Did you need it ? No. Did you want it ? Yes. Could you afford it ? Maybe not. But did it feel good ? Totally. Do you love watching sport on it ? Absolutely.
It’s no different for your client. They rarely buy a house or decide upon a renovation based on simple logic. They buy the feeling that comes from owning or modifying a home; the security (“I can stay as long as I like”); and the enjoyment (“I can have a home that really works for me”). It’s feelings that influence the buying decision and the builder who connects with these is more likely to get the job.
Focus on finding the emotion behind the logic and make sure you address it; then you’ll be dealing with the real buyer.
How often do customers end up disappointed because of cost ‘blow outs’, especially with renovations. An estimate of $180k ends up at $250k and you get a bad name, when it was their house that was the problem; they had no idea about what was lurking behind the facade.
Teach your clients how a build (especially a renovation) works. Give as much detail as possible. Do a drive-by of previous jobs, so they have something to compare with. If possible, give a detailed quote for everything that can be quoted and, based on your experience, provide an estimate of the finished price. Be clear that this is an estimate only, based on what you can see.
Finally, establish a clear and detailed variation process, where you gain approval prior to starting. Ensure they know precisely what ‘extras’ they are paying for before you incur the cost.
Imagine if your local car dealer had just one car in the yard. Would you buy from him ? Likely not. You’d go to a place where there was more choice.
So, in the early stages, give your customer options and ask questions about what they like. Provide good information so they can make an informed choice.
“If possible, give a detailed quote for everything that can be quoted and based on your experience, provide an estimate of the finished price
Eventually, as you get to more technical questions, they will ask for your opinion. This is highly important, as it means they are no longer treating you as just another builder but as a trusted advisor – one whose quote can be trusted because it covers all the bases.
It is not the better builder, but the person the client THINKS is the better builder, that wins the quote.
Unless you have a show home, your client can’t sample before they purchase. They make their decision on what they see during the sales process.So let them see professionalism.
Get a nice presentation case for your documents. Use a nice pen and dress as your clients would expect someone to dress who is advising them on investing several hundred thousand dollars.
Present your quotes in smart, new folders, or even get them printed and bound. Use your best promotional materials that answer the presale questions, ‘Who are you ? ’ and ‘Can I trust you ? ’ Gather together a sample of testimonials that match your client’s profile, so they can see you really do know what you’re doing.
Following the above tips should greatly improve your chances of landing more quotes.

Crowe Horwath has seen an increase in fraud in New Zealand over the past five years. While that doesn’t mean you should suddenly become suspicious of everyone around you, certain facts can’t be ignored. General trends show that business fraud is likely to be committed by an employee, generally from a position of trust and responsibility.
Fraud can take a number of forms and includes:
Manipulation, falsification or alteration of accounting records for personal benefit.
Theft of assets, including cash or stock.
Payments for fictitious invoices or payroll obligations.
Using business assets for personal gain, eg fraudulent loans.
A model explaining the factors present in almost all fraud situations, known as the ‘Fraud Triangle’, was devised by American sociologist and criminologist Donald R Cressey. It suggests that organisations eliminate at least one of the following components to decrease the probability of fraud.
Motive – the need to commit fraud.
Rationalisation – the mind-set of the fraudster, whereby they justify committing fraud.
Opportunity – the situation that enables the fraud to occur.
Business owners and managers should therefore be aware of the components of the ‘fraud triangle’ and how they relate to their particular circumstances.
An important consideration is the motive of employees/stakeholders to commit fraud. Examples of questions that may be considered include:
What incentives are offered to employees and suppliers?
What are the risks of accounting records being manipulated to present a false position?
Does the business have employees who do not take holidays – if so, why is this the case?
Do any employees have financial pressures or gambling, drug or alcohol problems?
The mind-set of individuals within the business who may be in a position to commit fraud should be studied. Examples of questions that may be considered include:
Has an employee been passed over for promotion, and therefore may be displaying a level of indifference to their responsibilities?
Does an employee with a high level of responsibility display evidence of being marginalised within the organisation?
Are there ineffective systems and controls that are not protecting the assets of the business?
This is the only component of the ‘fraud triangle’ that you can have a significant effect on –the introduction and establishment of adequate controls and systems. You should seriously consider all controls and systems that are in place, in order to reduce the risk of fraud. Examples of questions that may be considered include:
Are the business’ duties sufficiently segregated? Where practical, duties should be segregated as follows:
Authorisation of all documents, eg purchase invoices.
Transactional accounting through the organisation’s accounting system.
Physical custody and security of assets.
Responsibility for the reconciliation and review of accounting balances.
Authorisation of payments to creditors.
Proper supervision and authorisation of payroll.
How is the performance of management and staff monitored, such as regular reviews?
What systems are in place to test that controls are operating as necessary?
While the risk of fraud can never be fully eliminated, it can be reduced to an acceptable level.
In the current economic environment, businesses really haves no choice but to consider fraud and the systems and controls in place to achieve this acceptable level. It is unfortunately true that on too many occasions, these considerations are not undertaken until after fraud has been committed, financial losses suffered and recovery of these losses is remote, if not impossible.
In the worst-case scenarios, fraud can significantly affect both the financial viability and/or reputation of the organisation. Therefore, given the available resources and day-to-day running of a business, be proactive in considering the risk from fraud and the effect it would have, by paying attention to each or all of the components of the ‘fraud triangle’ as they relate to your own circumstances.
If you would like to know more about how to mitigate the risk of fraud within your organisation, or if your business has recently suffered fraud and you wouldike advice around strengthening your systems and controls, please contact Paul Lawrence (paul.lawrence@crowehorwath.co.nz), or contact your local Crowe Horwath advisor on 0800 494 569 or www.crowehorwath.co.nz

With the discussion about cost savings in residential building gaining momentum, there is pressure on builders to deliver even better value
When hiring a new team member, remuneration options are often an afterthought. Both salary and withholding tax payments have their pros and cons, but simply choosing based on what works better for you and your business is a relic of the past. It is important to understand the details behind each ‘type’ of worker.
Employees have Pay As You Earn (PAYE) tax, which includes any ACC levies, student loan, KiwiSaver or other superannuation payments (all where applicable) deducted from each salary payment. This means that unless they have other income in their name, their core taxes are paid on their behalf by their employers. The onus for these payments is on the employer, and any non-compliance with the law regarding these is a matter settled between the employer and the IRD. Tax returns can be filed with the IRD by way of Personal Tax Summaries.
Employees are also fully entitled to holiday pay and sick leave payments from their employer. This is by f a r the simplest approach to personal income tax for a worker, but is more complicated for the employer.
Conversely, if you hire someone as a contractor, the task of complying with New Zealand Tax Law is more arduous for the worker, while it’s simpler for you.
Labour-only building contractors have 20% withholding tax, withheld by the payer and administered at the same time as PAYE, but are still required to file an income tax return each year and pay any additional tax (based on their marginal tax rates). Most other contractors do not have withholding tax withheld, but may be required to make provisional tax payments throughout the year. They are also able to claim certain expenses against their income, such as travel necessary for work, or, in a builder’s case, expenses for repairs and maintenance on any tools they use in the course of their work, along with depreciation on tools and vehicles.
Contractors are required to be GST registered if they earn over $60,000 in a 12-month period, and must file a full income tax return at the end of the financial year. Contractors are not entitled to sick leave or holiday pay, and are not able to take up personal grievance claims against the employer.
As shown above, there are definite advantages and drawbacks to each party in each situation. However, the decision to hire someone as a contractor or an employee does not rest simply on what works best for your business!
The best method to decide how to treat your worker for tax purposes is to consider the following areas:
Do they have the ability to work for another employer on another job while working for you ? If they do, then they would fall under the contracting realm of employment.
Who dictates the amount to be paid to the worker ? If the worker is planning on invoicing based on an hourly rate that they have offered to the employer, they would be deemed a contractor. However, if the worker is paid a set rate based on the employer’s discretion, they would be viewed as an employee.
Can the worker take holidays as they wish, or is it up to the employer’s discretion ? If holiday periods are dictated by the employer, then the worker is likely to be deemed as an employee.
Do they supply their own tools for work ? If they supply the majority of their own tools, which are not paid for by the employer via any tool allowance contribution, or are expected to provide their own tools, then they would likely be deemed a contractor. An employee would not be expected to provide their own tools.
Does the worker invoice the employer for hours completed on jobs ? If so, they are a contractor. Employees are paid a rate based on a full day of availability for work, whether the work is there or not. Contractors only get paid based on the hours they work.
These are just a few examples of areas that the IRD look at, and as you read through the above methods, it is easy to see why it has become a grey area for businesses.
In certain situations, it may be that a worker meets some of the tests for being an employee, while also meeting some of the criteria for being a contractor. What is important is that all reasons for the treatment of a worker are documented, with a rigorous process being followed to determine their nature. Essentially, the less control a business has over a worker and their activities, the more likely they are to be deemed a contractor.
If you have questions about how you should be paying your workers, or have any other questions regarding contractors or  employees, please contact Peter van der Heijden at peter.vdh@crowehorwath.co.nz ; or your local Crowe Horwath advisor.

With the weather warming up and Christmas around the corner, the mad rush is about to begin! While it can be lucrative for builders, managing stress throughout this time is vital to your health – a prominent theme in this edition of Under Construction
Whether your customers are finally building a long-awaited deck, refurbishing their kitchen or adding a pool ahead of summer, chances are they’ll want it done ASAP.
Having all that work is likely good for your business, but is it good for you? This article covers three tried and true ways to reduce stress during the silly season.
Define and list
“I feel really stressed!” If you’ve ever had that thought, then don’t worry, you’re not alone.
However, it appears that the feeling of stress is exactly that: a feeling (unless there is a medical or physical cause).
Stressful feelings are preceded by thoughts. For example, if you think “there’s too much to do” or “I can’t cope,” then feelings of stress are likely to arise.
Conversely, if your thoughts are “I have plenty of time to do what I need to do”, it’s likely that you won’t feel the same level of stress.
With this in mind, a strategy to reduce stress is to change your thinking from non-coping to coping thoughts. One way to do this is to define or list everything that needs to be done as it comes up.
Estimate the time and resource it will take and compare that with what you have available. If you can make it work or fit it in, then add it to your to-do list. If not, add it to your waiting list and only add it to your to-do list when you have the capacity to get it done.
Much of our stress also comes from the feeling of being driven by the priorities of other people. Just because they want it done by a certain date, does not mean that you need to drive yourself to comply.
It’s nice to be able to meet other people’s expectations, but not essential. So don’t get caught out with a to-do list that’s impossible to complete. Start a wait list and let people know if they’re on it.
Pounds before pennies
“Look after the pennies and the pounds will look after themselves” might be helpful in teaching a child basic financial sense, but it’s not very helpful in business.
For example, it doesn’t really matter if you have some small inefficiencies in your operational area (pennies) but heaps of forward work (pounds).
However, it’s worrying if you have wonderful efficiency but no forward work. When you are facing a busy time, it’s really important that you do not quit the activities that created your busy time in the first place.
For example, some builders have found a networking group like Business Network International very useful to get them started. Then, when they become busy, they drop their membership and quit the discipline of asking and looking for leads. They stop marketing in other ways and, as a result, their new business tails away.
When your business gets busy, you may not have time to market and sell in the same way as you did before. You may need to look for new ways, but it’s vital that you don’t stop, because that’s what got you to this stage.
Moreover, it’s when your business is busy and you are earning additional profits that you can afford to pay for new and additional marketing resources, which could well propel your business to the next level.
When you are busy, be resolute about looking after your marketing and sales strategies (the pounds).
One thing at a time
Possums get run over when they quit scurrying. If they’d kept to their initial plan of crossing the road and hadn’t let headlights interrupt their progress, they’d be more likely to survive.
Often, we get distracted in the same way when we get interrupted. Focus is lost and output drops. While you are still on your first task, you have started out on a second, then a third and so on.
At the end of the day, when you find yourself asking “what have I done today?” it’s often because nothing has been completed. This leads to “I can’t get everything done” thoughts and stress levels start to rise.
When you stay focused on the task at hand and see it through until it’s complete, you will fi nish more jobs and feel as though you are coping better. Don’t take that interrupting phone call – leave it until lunch time!
Switch off text and email notifications. Then, when you are replying to texts, phone calls and emails, give them your full attention until finished.
By putting these three steps in place now, you are likely to stay in better control of your workflow throughout the busy holiday season.

While some people might think that the current construction ‘boom’ gives builders a licence to print money, the reality is very different. Seeking advice from the right place can help your business take advantage of the opportunities available to it
T he talk about a ‘boom’ period for the construction industry is born mainly out of the Christchurch rebuild and continued growth in Auckland.
However, working in a challenging industry such as construction during a high-growth period doesn’t make running your business automatically easier. In fact, due to the pressures of quoting, tight deadlines and a highly competitive market, it is often just as tough as during a downturn!
Steady as she goes
Despite the good times, we are still seeing the collapse of a large number of firms in construction or related industries.
It seems that every month another medium-to-large firm has gone into liquidation, catching many people by surprise. The reasons for this are varied but, undeniably, a major contributing factor is that the owners have taken their eye off the ball and lost sight of what made their business great to begin with.
They may have grown too big too fast, or bitten off more than they can chew and, all of a sudden, they’re closing their doors.
How do I avoid this?
It is an undisputed fact that small businesses succeed due to the strength of the owners. All of us have our own weaknesses, but often they are not as obvious in small business, especially when the core business can take care of itself.
Once a business starts to grow, many owners find themselves stepping out of their comfort zone and dealing with issues that they don’t know the answers to. This can become a crucial turning point for a business, as the owner spends more time focusing on weaker areas (for example, studying up on changes to law).
What inevitably happens is that the owner ends up not having as much time to play to the strengths that got them to a strong position in the first place. While the business may continue to go well, it doesn’t go as well as it could.
Advisory boards
An advisory board can help guide business owners in key areas that have caused them concern and stress, such as:
Financial reporting and analysis.
Prospecting and selling services.
Keeping up-to-date with law changes.
Whatever area your business needs help with, building a board of experts tailored to meet your specific needs can greatly help. Such a board is usually made up of industry experts (such as a business mentor or a previous boss), an accountant and a lawyer.
If there are other people required, such as sales experts, include them as well. At monthly meetings, run through a set agenda of items that the business needs to focus on and work towards providing solutions. The upside to this approach is immeasurable. While there is going to be a cost involved (we recommend negotiating this upfront) having access to expert help is invaluable.
You will be able to tap into other industry experts who have been through similar situations. This means that plans can be formulated in advance to avoid any potential problems.
It also allows the business to change from being reactive to proactive – identifying in advance potential issues that the owner may never have considered and ensuring that they are effectively addressed.
This advisory board strategy is applicable to any stage of a business’ lifecycle – be it start up, growth, maturity or exit.
While the advisory board may change according to requirements and phases, the result is always the same – the business receives ongoing expert advice and support.

How to get the most out of working with an architect.
While some builders find architects difficult to deal with, others find their design skills, expertise and fondness for pushing the boundaries paves the way to a rewarding build.
In March 2014, architect Nat Cheshire won the Home New Zealand Magazine 2014 Home of the Year Award. For Oakland Homes director Peter Oakden, working with such a great architect was well worth any extra effort.
“Building for an architect can be extremely rewarding and satisfying, but it can also be challenging because of the different demands,” says Peter. “Architects’ designs are often extremely creative and they like to push the boundaries.”
Most builders want their projects to progress as smoothly and as calmly as possible. However, undertaking a complex build can be bumpy, so ensuring you have a good working relationship with your architect could be a worthwhile investment.
Below are some pointers to take into account when working with architects (and which apply equally to dealing with designers, contractors and homeowners).
Architects develop unique designs based on the particular requirements of their clients, the possibilities of the building site, and the requirements of the Building Act and local bylaws. Fused together with artistic creativity, they give birth to stunning, enduring and (sometimes) public masterpieces. So don’t be surprised if your architect is extremely passionate about their work.
The perspective of the architect is quite different from that of the builder. While both are focused on completing the build, the builder concentrates more on technical detail while the architect’s focus is on the finished product.
While you need to know the construction drawings inside out to carry out the build, you also need to be able to picture the finished product that will satisfy the architect. So, study the elevations and landscaping features until you get a clear picture of the completed project. Try to imagine the flow as the client uses rooms and enjoys features and check out things like view lines, join lines and finish details.
Find out what details are important to your architect and clarify the reasoning behind these. It may be that a detail you consider expensive or complicated to build – and therefore unnecessary – is exactly what is required to give the building the finished appearance the architect has imagined.
Remember, your architect is primarily concerned about how the home is presented at the finish rather than how it’s built, as that’s what they’re judged on.
If you’re unsure about anything, ask for clarification.
You may wish to suggest a detail or material to the architect that suits you better than the solution stipulated in the plans – though you should always consult your client and bear in mind it may require amendment to consent (by the architect).
This is especially the case where you might be uncertain about the purpose of a section and need to make an interpretation – make sure you verify what your architect is aiming to achieve.
In any building project, it’s the level of communication that often determines how smoothly it flows.
From the beginning, make sure you maintain regular communication with your architect either in person or via phone or email. It’s a good idea to keep them updated with a weekly progress report – especially if they haven’t visited the job for a while.
Maintaining open communication channels builds the foundation for honest discussion, making it much easier to discuss sensitive issues – such as if you disagree with a detail, or you have a “better” suggestion.
Changes in schedule are quite normal with most architectural builds, as some things may go faster or slower than you expected. However, you can minimise frustration by keeping your architect updated, so they can finalise details in time.
It is frustrating for both architect and builder when detailing is late – especially too late!
When you stuff something up, come clean quickly. If it’s not right, then do it again – or at least offer to do so. Architects are human (so they tell us) and make mistakes as well.  Sometimes you come across details which you know will lead to problems – stop and sort it out sooner rather than later, including who is going to pay for the variation.
Sometimes a builder gets caught between loyalty to the architect (who may refer other clients in future) and loyalty to the client (who engaged the architect).
For example, imagine that the owners told you how much they hated the lack of privacy in their existing house – you notice the ground floor bedroom window will line up with a window in the neighbouring property. Changing the height of the window so that the sill is higher will mean the neighbours can’t see in. Do you speak to the owner and/or bring it up with the architect? Or do you say nothing?
If you believe there is a real opportunity for the client then you must bring it up; do so professionally, because you respect the architect, and strategically, because you want the best outcome for the client.
Architects are passionate about their work and aim to deliver a high level of excellence. Those builders who learn to work with them are likely to share in that excellence and grow their building skill and prowess.

TITLE   : Retentions – bond or trust?

Retentions are often a source of headaches for those working in the construction industry – but did you know that there’s an alternative to help alleviate the associated stress?
M ost subcontractors who’ve had to agree to have retentions withheld from their invoices will have experienced the trepidation that comes with worrying if they’ll ever see that money again.
Many find recovering it once their defects liability period has ended a long and painful process, even from a main contractor that’s still trading, let alone one that’s gone bust.
Fortunately, from 1 April 2017 retention money withheld by a principal or contractor must be held ‘on trust’ until being released to the subcontractor. See the MBIE article on page 8 for more details.
The retention trust regime will only apply to commercial construction contracts (not to residential contracts with the home owner) where the retention money is above a specified amount, yet to be determined by regulation.
Held on trust means the money has to be properly accounted for and can’t simply form part of a ‘slush fund’, or be used as working capital to cashflow the main contractor’s operation. Subcontractors will be able to demand evidence that their retentions are being held on trust.
However, these changes – passed into law in 2015 as part of the Construction Contracts Amendments Act – will not require retention money to be held in separate, secured bank accounts.
This means there is still a risk that a principal or main contractor could wrongly use the money and that if they get into trouble, their subcontractors could still lose out.
However, it does mean that rather than being at the back, subcontractors will be at the head of the queue to get their retention money back through the liquidation process.
Making retentions easier for main contractors
Because of these new requirements, principals and main contractors will need to develop contract agreements, payment terms, accounting policies and reporting systems that comply with their own trust obligations.
Should retention funds be kept in separate trust accounts for each job, or in one consolidated retentions account, or neither, and simply be accounted for separately in the books ?
MBIE warns that breaching these obligations, which may implicate directors personally, could result in substantial penalties, including criminal prosecution.
In this new environment, one alternative that provides the same security as cash retentions, but is much easier to administrate (and comes without the consequent trust obligations), is a bond in lieu of retentions or retention bond.
A bond in lieu of retentions
Rather than withholding the subcontractors’ retentions from each invoice and having to hold it before repaying it at the end of the defects liability period, a principal or main contractor can simply demand a retention bond.
The subcontractor arranges the bond with an insurance company and presents it to their main contractor. The bond covers the amount of their retentions and expires at the end of the defects liability period.
A retention bond provides the same assurance to the main contractor that, should any problem arise after the work is finished, the subcontractor will come back to fix it.
If they refuse or can’t do so, the main contractor simply calls on the bond and the insurer pays out first, then seeks recovery of their money from the subcontractor.
They are called ‘on demand’ bonds, because there is an obligation on the insurer to pay first and assess the claim later, to ensure the process is swift and the bondee (the main contractor) can get on with fixing the defects.
The subcontractor doesn’t get off the hook, because they’ve paid a premium for the bond and, if they’re still around, the insurer who backed it will want to recoup their money.
Benefits for principals and main contractors
Firstly, bonds provide the same security as withholding retentions. In the event that the subcontractor fails to rectify defects, the bond can be used to pay another contractor to fix them.
Secondly, because they’re not holding any funds on trust, there are no trust obligations or trustee liabilities on the company directors or compliance requirements under the Construction Contracts Act.
Finally, a bond in lieu of retentions is easy to specify in contracts and they expire when the defects liability period ends (or on whatever date is agreed in the contract), so there is no administrative burden or paperwork involved in returning them.
Benefits for subcontractors
Firstly, providing a bond in lieu of retentions means that the subcontractor’s cash flow position is immediately improved, as every invoice is paid in full with no retention money withheld.
Secondly, they don’t have to wait for three, six or 12 months after the project ends to get their final payment (return of their retentions) and book the profit on the job.
Finally, they don’t have the risk that their main contractor goes into liquidation before returning their retention money.
Even under the new CCA rules, there is still a risk that retention money could be lost if it hasn’t been accounted for properly or there isn’t enough to go around.
How to arrange a bond
Once the two parties have agreed that a bond in lieu of retentions is the preferred method of guaranteeing defect resolution, the subcontractor applies for the bond.
After a one-time assessment of the company’s management structure and financial position, each subsequent bond application resembles a normal insurance application.
It requests details of the project, the two parties and the amount being bonded. There is a premium to pay and then the bond is issued to both parties.
If you’re interested in replacing your cash retentions obligations with an insurance-backed bond, contact your broker or Builtin for more information.

Builtin looks at what events can trigger a public liability insurance claim, how this is determined, and what this means when it comes to cancelling insurance
There are a few key triggers that must be met before your public liability insurance claim can even be considered. First, the event which triggers the claim must be within the policy period. This can be a source of misunderstanding, because there are often a few different events associated with a claim, so you need to understand which is the important one.
Different events:
The only important event when it comes to a public liability claim is when the damage actually happened. It doesn’t matter when you did the work, when the damage was discovered, or when you were told about it. The claim should still be made under the policy that was in place when the damage occurred, even if it was years earlier.
An example
A renovation of a residential property was completed in January 2012. In 2018 a leak was discovered; it had taken time to penetrate internal linings and only came to light after discolouration  started to appear. It was determined that the leak began sometime in 2014, with damage to the framing timber starting in 2015 after months of being wet. The homeowner made a claim on their  insurance, which was declined, so the homeowner notified the builder in January 2019 that they would be holding him liable for the repair costs.
In this case, the builder needs to claim on the policy he had in place in 2015. Even if he has changed insurers in that time, the insurer of the policy he had in 2015 should be the one to respond to claims for events during that policy period, even if the claim is made years later. If he had cancelled his policy in 2013 after the job was finished, but before damage had occurred, he would have no cover as the event triggering the claim (ie, when the damage occurred) happened in 2015.
When does wet timber become damaged?
Most of the time, it’s easy to identify when the damage occurred. It’s when you dropped the rangehood onto the induction cooktop, or when the digger hit the underground pipe. In other situations, it can be very difficult – as with timber that gets wet and rots.
In a famous legal case between Arrow International and QBE, the judge decided that damage occurs when there has been “an alteration to the physical state of the timber which impairs its value or usefulness as a component in the building”. This is not necessarily when it first becomes wet or even when it is discovered. The judge said that damage had clearly been suffered when rotting of the timber had occurred. There is also a reference to “de minimis”, which basically means the damage has to have reached a minimum threshold for it to be considered as such.
The judge indicated that, in the absence of any expert advice to the contrary, damage to timber is deemed to occur within 6-18 months of completion of the work. It was further agreed that once a building starts to leak, there will be enough moisture in the wood to promote fungal growth within three to six months. During the next six months, decay will advance so that it is well under way; such that the strength of the wood is compromised.  Physical damage, in terms of the policy, has occurred by then, although “each case must be examined on its own facts”.
Gradual damage/deterioration exclusion
Unfortunately, since this case most insurers have added an exclusion to public/general liability cover (and to domestic house policies) that excludes claims from gradual deterioration, such as rotting timber.
However, there is always the potential for delayed damage claims from other events.
In a nutshell
One of the key triggers for a liability claim is that the damage must have occurred during the policy period. In some cases, this can happen months or years after the job was done. This is why it’s a good idea to keep your cover in place for a while after you’ve finished the job, including after you retire.

It’s fair to say that when something goes wrong, how well your insurer responds can be the difference between a good result and a nightmare. Here’s some advice to help you achieve the fastest, fairest outcome
Liability policies cover broadly defined risks such as “accidental damage”. It’s impossible to list all the scenarios where accidental damage could occur and certain, often broadly defined, situations are also excluded. This makes it hard to say whether a particular situation will be a claim without first investigating it. As a result, there are grey areas where something could be a claim depending on a person’s interpretation of the situation and policy wording. This makes the assessment process critical. Consider the following examples:
Example 1 If a builder was installing insulation in a roof space and he accidentally put his foot through the ceiling, is this a public liability claim? Maybe. It depends on your policy’s wording and insurer’s interpretation of the incident. Was the ceiling the “property being worked on”? Was the house a new build and could therefore be considered “the builder’s product”? If the answer is yes to the above questions (in the insurer’s view) then, depending on the policy in place, a claim could be declined.
Example 2 An excavator preparing the site for a new house damages an underground cable, causing a power outage. Would this be covered by the contract works insurance? No. The underground services are “existing structures” and “third party property”: as such they are not part of the contract works and are therefore outside of the cover under a contract works policy. They may, however, be covered by public liability insurance under an “underground services” extension. In that case, to avoid jeopardising a potential claim, the policy may require that action to locate any existing cables and pipes is undertaken first.
Example 3 A builder putting up a heated towel rail puts a screw through a hidden water pipe. Is this accidental damage?That depends. Should a builder, who ought to know this was a possibility, have checked first? If he didn’t, is it faulty workmanship? What you might consider to be an accident could be interpreted by a claims assessor as defective workmanship and subject to an exclusion or higher excess.
Understand what your policy covers Probably the most common reason for dissatisfaction with the outcome of a liability claim is because the insured party has assumed the policy will cover something that it is not intended to. No one expects you to be an expert in the wording of your insurance policy, but it is important that you spend some time getting a handle on the cover it provides.
Read the policy and speak to your insurer or broker when you take it out, and again at renewal. If something happens, at least you’ll be in a better position to assess if it is a prima facie (on the face of it) valid claim or not.
Take due care This is obvious, but a momentary assumption on site can backfire when it comes to a claim being accepted.
Do not admit liability Even though it might be obvious to all involved that you were responsible for the damage, if you intend to make an insurance claim then the insurer (and ultimately the courts) decides who is responsible; you cannot make this call on their behalf. Do not promise that your insurer will sort it out, simply say that you will contact your insurance company.
Tell your insurance company ASAP The quicker you put in a claim, the faster it will be sorted out and the less likely it is that other subsequent actions might jeopardise the claim. In some cases, it may be faster for an owner to claim with their house insurer (or material damage insurer for commercial property), who may then seek to recover their costs from you (via your insurance). Either way, don’t delay making the call to your insurer.
Depending on the type of claim, they will probably appoint an independent assessor to investigate the situation, determine liability, assess the likely cost and recommend a course of action.
Provide all the details Make sure you complete the claim form in full and with as much supporting evidence as possible. If the insurer has to come back to you for more detail, this will inevitably result in delays. They will expect:
1. A description of what happened. 2. Date and time of the event. 3. Written correspondence from the third party stating that they are holding you liable for the damage. 4. An estimate of the cost of the damage. 5. Evidence such as photos, invoices, perhaps a copy of your contract, witness statements and other correspondence.
Cooperate fully and be truthful Claims assessors and loss adjustors are experts at sniffing out inconsistencies and if something doesn’t add up, they’ll keep digging. The best approach is to answer their questions as fully as possible and allow them to make their decision based on all the facts.
A broker is on your side at claim time If you have a broker, you should expect them to help you prepare the claim and represent you to the insurer. This is where a good broker who is experienced in construction industry claims earns their money.
If your claim falls into one of the grey areas of the policy, then having an expert on board could be the difference between it being accepted or declined. If you deal directly with an insurer or through their agent, it will be up to you to argue the case.
It’s not that insurers decline claims unfairly – in our experience this is not the case in the New Zealand insurance industry. However, when it comes to claims that fall into that grey area, and plenty of liability claims do, which way the decision falls could be down to the claims manager’s interpretation of both the events and the policy wording.
That’s when you need someone with expertise and experience to argue the alternative point of view.
In a nutshell Liability claims are often not straightforward, and liability policies are open to interpretation. When you’re making a claim, keep the following in mind:
–  Don’t admit liability. –  Get on to it straight away. –  Cooperate with the assessor. –  Supply information fully and frankly. –  Ideally have someone with expertise on your side.
Keep these in mind to increase your chances of a swift and successful outcome.

There’s a big difference between health insurance and income protection – which should you spend your money on?
With the New Year under way, it’s a good time to ensure you have everything in place behind the scenes, so that you can focus on running your business. There are a number of aspects to consider, but one important and often overlooked consideration is what support you have in place if you need time off the tools due to illness or injury.
This is where health insurance and income protection insurance can help. Knowing the difference between the two, however, is key. It’s not uncommon for people to confuse these two types of insurance and think that they offer similar cover. But they don’t!
Income protection
Provides regular monthly payments to replace your income, if you’re unable to work due to illness or injury.
Doesn’t ACC do that?
ACC does a similar thing, but for accidents only. Income protection covers both accident and illness, including mental health. Since even builders are more likely to be off work through illness than accidental injury, income protection is often a better option than just relying on ACC.
Self-employed people can also dial down their ACC cover and put the saving towards income protection insurance, getting broader cover, often for a similar total cost. There are pros and cons to this arrangement, which is why we advocate discussing your situation with an independent financial adviser, who can make a recommendation that best suits your needs.
Health insurance
Covers the cost of treatment for a health or medical issue.
Doesn’t our public health system do that?
Yes it does. However, health insurance can help you get faster access to treatment through the private system. It can also reduce the cost of private treatment for certain conditions.
Health insurance will not pay to replace your income during any period that you’re off work recovering from an accident, illness, surgery or medical procedure, or if you’re unable to work while undergoing treatment.
So, what should I do?
As both types of insurance provide different cover, you may want to have them both.
If you only have income protection, you must rely on the public health system for treatment if you get sick; however, you would receive regular payments to replace your income until you could return to work.
If you only have health insurance and you get sick, then you may receive treatment sooner but would need to rely on disability income support from WINZ (currently just over $60 a week) if you were unable to work and had no other sources of income.
You could also opt for a combination. For example, taking income protection for yourself but putting health insurance in place for the kids.
Ultimately, speaking to an experienced adviser before you make this decision is the right way to go.

TITLE   : A director’s duty

Are you a director of your own limited company? Did you know that you could be held personally liable if your company fails to pay its debts
T he building industry in New Zealand is chocka with small businesses, as well as individual tradesmen operating as contractors through a limited company. Regardless of the size of your operation, as a director you have a responsibility to act in the best interests of the company.
There are two sections of the Companies Act 1993 that are particularly relevant and all company directors should be well aware of them:
A director of a company must not— a) agree to the business of the company being carried on in a manner likely to create a substantial risk of serious loss to the company’s creditors; or b) cause or allow the business of the company to be carried on in a manner likely to create a substantial risk of serious loss to the company’s creditors.
A director of a company must not agree to the company incurring an obligation unless the director believes at that time on reasonable grounds that the company will be able to perform the obligation when it is required to do so.
If your company is forced into liquidation, it’s a good bet the liquidator will want to know if the business had been trading while insolvent. If so, they are very likely to take a close look at the directors, with a view to recovering any debts the company owes from the directors personally.
Solvency means the company is able to pay its debts as they become due.
If the value of its assets is less than the value of its liabilities, your company is insolvent.
If your business is not able to pay its creditors when the debts fall due, your company is insolvent.
In either case, you shouldn’t be taking on any new obligations (such as new customers or creditors) and should seek professional advice immediately. We know from experience that many building companies do continue to operate while technically insolvent. While this may not be a problem for the day-to-day running of the business, it does place liability upon the directors personally if the company gets into trouble.
What insurance is available to protect company directors from their personal liability? Following cases like Pike River, Easy Rider and the big finance company collapses, company directors are increasingly being targeted in legal action to recover the losses suffered by employees, customers and creditors of the company. The construction sector is no exception, particularly when it comes to money owed to creditors or clients, or for breaches of health and safety law.
As a company director, if you’re accused of a breach of your responsibilities, you may face substantial legal bills just to defend yourself. Directors and officers (D&O) liability insurance pays your legal defense costs if you are accused of failing in your duties and taken to court personally. We recommend you speak to an insurance professional to discuss your situation and find out more about the protection D&O cover can offer you as a company director.

Like any insurance policy, exclusions make clear the things not covered. This month, we look at exclusions for liability you’ve contracted into, loss of use, defamation, defective workmanship and property you’ve hired or are looking after.
Some polices won’t cover the cost of fixing any workmanship that causes damage. Others exclude cover for faulty workmanship only if it results in water penetration of the building envelope (see the explanation of the Building Defects exclusion in last month’s article). ‘Downstream’ damage that occurs as a result of faulty workmanship may still be covered, however. Specialist insurers, such as Builtin, allow you to purchase an extension to cover your liability from faulty workmanship.
Note: The issue of faulty workmanship is one of the trickiest areas of liability for builders and specialist tradespeople. We recommend that you understand how your policy covers you for faulty workmanship and switch to a policy with a more ‘builder friendly’ wording and options.
The policy is not intended to pay for things that you promised to do in a contract but then failed to do – that’s your problem. So unless you would be held liable for it under the law anyway, any liability you contract into is excluded from cover.
The policy won’t cover you if a client can’t get into their house (or use any other property) because of a delay or product failure that you’re responsible for. They may hold you liable for extra rental, hotel and travel costs for example, but these can’t be claimed on your policy.
You are not covered if someone takes you to court because you said or published things about them that were untrue and damaged their reputation. Can be included in cover as an option.
Any claim related to your property (tools you own), property you’re being paid to look after (maybe you’re storing the homeowner’s garden furniture in a portacabin, while work is being done) or property you’ve hired (such as scaffolding) is excluded.
Note: This article is intended to clarify some of the exclusions contained within most general/public liability policies available from major insurers in New Zealand. This article is not comprehensive and should not be relied upon as legal advice. Insurers will interpret and apply their own policy wording depending on the specific circumstances of each individual claim.

Difficult economic conditions are making life hard for the Kiwi construction sector. So, how can you safeguard your livelihood against the worst? BuiltIn insurance expert Ben Rickard explains
R ecent media reports have highlighted volatile trading conditions in the building industry, with concern that these could affect the solvency of many companies. Indeed, we are already seeing a spike in liquidations both here and in Australia. What measures can builders and other trade businesses take to be prepared for the financial pressure that might be coming ?
Financial competence
The most fundamental requirement for any business to help navigate challenging economic conditions is to have a very clear understanding of its financial position. At a minimum, this must include a cash flow forecast, operating margins and working capital metrics.
These will allow you to see if there are periods ahead where cash is tight, margins are being squeezed or if your short-term liabilities (eg, what you owe to suppliers) exceeds current assets (eg, what you’re owed or have in the bank). The key is to be prepared and make sure that, if there is a potential problem, you see it coming.
Speak to your accountant about setting up a dashboard, where you can check these figures regularly and act if it looks like they are heading in the wrong direction. If you’re not especially financially literate, lean on your accountant or someone else with the right skills.
Costs and credit terms
Can you reduce costs, refinance or obtain extended credit terms ? It’s better to make these decisions before it’s too late and the dashboard mentioned above can help give you that advance warning.
Sell or downgrade assets
Can you free up capital you might need by switching from owning to leasing vehicles ? Alternatively, can you downgrade to something more affordable, at least in the short term ?
Contractual terms
What does your contract say about cost inflation and does it allow you to pass this on to customers ? Many builders are moving away from fixed-price contracts because margins can quickly get eaten up by price increases and project delays.
Don’t take on too much
It can be tempting to accept every job that comes along on the basis that it’s better in your pocket than someone else’s, especially when there’s concern about demand softening over the coming months. Yet taking on low margin jobs can come back to bite you, particularly when prices are rising and there are difficulties with supply. Better to spend that time seeking out good quality work.
Replacing retentions with a bond
Having retentions withheld on a contract can have a big impact on cash flow, so providing a bond instead of those retentions can help. That way, your invoices are paid in full rather than waiting for months to get that money out of the principal or main contractor.
Good risk management
In good times, the business might be able to weather an unforeseen event and finance to pay for an unforeseen problem or loss might be easier to come by. When the economy is tighter, finance becomes harder to get and there might not be as much money in your rainy-day pot.
That’s why it becomes even more important that you have insurance in place in a downturn. Here are some examples of insurance cover that might not be in your basic package, but could be a financial lifesaver in tight financial times:
1. Directors and Officers’ Liability If insolvency cover is included and the company gets into financial trouble, the policy will protect company directors from a liquidator trying to recover losses from their personal assets. In some situations, liquidators have powers under the Companies Act to do this on behalf of creditors.
2. Crime/Fidelity This reimburses losses due to theft, typically by an employee or someone in a position to siphon money out of the business. The most common means of doing this is by setting up and paying fake accounts. Over time, these losses grow and can end up in the hundreds of thousands of dollars.
3. Employee Disputes Liability You never really know a person until you see them under stress. In a downturn, this stress can result in all kinds of negative behaviour and business owners are no exception. If an employee has a grievance, this can not only add a significant amount of stress, but also a substantial financial burden to you and the business. This policy covers the legal bills for defending cases taken to the Employment Relations Authority and any compensation awarded.
4. Tools cover For many builders and tradies, tools are probably the most uninsured assets you own, while also being some of the most critical to your ability to continue operating your business. As the economic squeeze goes on, property crime rates increase and trade tools are an easy target. The price of tools insurance is not as much as most people think, especially when the cost of not having it could be much greater. Make sure the cover you do have is full replacement value regardless of the age of the items.
5. Stock cover Incidences of material theft are also on the rise and, in many circumstances, materials may be uninsured. BuiltIn’s tools policy includes cover for stock at any site. It can be included in most contents/material damage policies as well, but be wary of the fine print, such as whether the cover is limited to a single fixed location.
Rather than paying all at once, paying your premiums monthly can also help with good cash flow management.
In a nutshell
A scout’s motto is ’always be prepared’. This applies equally to businesses going into uncertain economic times. The more prepared you are, the more prepared you’ll be to weather heavy seas.
Make sure you have key financial early warning indicators set up; have your costs, credit and contract terms optimised; and don’t take on too much work with narrow margins. Lastly, there are good costs and bad costs, so consider what risks you should insure to help mitigate significant financial shocks to your business .

Bad debt is a killer for businesses, particularly in the construction industry, which has a high liquidation rate. Here’s some tips to help you protect your company
A New Zealand-based study conducted in 2012 found that:
On average, it takes 18 months to receive settlement of an unsecured debt in the construction industry.
At the end of the liquidation process, almost half of all trade creditors will receive nothing.
These findings align closely with anecdotal evidence from the construction sector: most trade professionals we talk to will either have experienced it themselves or know someone who has.
Alongside good risk reduction measures, such as robust credit control, using Construction Contracts Act-compliant payment claims and registering your interests with the PPSR, there are a number of insurance options available to reduce the effects of bad debt on your company.
Even the most rigorous and disciplined credit management cannot prevent bad debts; any business with these exposures should ensure they are protected.
Protecting your retentions
Despite changes to the Construction Contracts Act (CCA) – which mean that, from 31 March, 2017, retention money must be held “on trust” by a main contractor – there is still no guarantee that subcontractors will get their retentions back if they haven’t been accounted for correctly, or have been spent by the head contractor as they try to avoid insolvency. It also only applies to commercial building.
In any case, your money is tied up in their business and is not helping your cash flow.
Retention bonds
Instead of agreeing to cash retentions, you can provide a bond instead. A bond is a promise from a surety provider, such as your bank or an insurance company, to the head contractor for the value of the retentions they want to hold.
You’ll pay a premium for an insurer to provide a bond on your behalf, but it means there is no risk of your retentions – often the profit on the job – being lost if your main contractor goes bust.
Protecting your accounts receivable
Your debtors ledger, which is the amount of money owed to you by your customers at any one time, is probably one of the biggest assets a trade business has. Unfortunately, it is probably the least insured. Self-insurance or a bad debt reserve does not replace the money lost, whereas credit insurance can put cash back in your hands.
Subcontractors payment guarantee insurance
A Subcontractors Payment Guarantee policy will pay 75% of the money owed to you by a head contractor when they become insolvent. It has a 30-day stand down period and does not apply to retentions or contracts you have already started.
The policy is aimed at smaller trade businesses, typically those with a turnover of less than $2m and where an event such as losing money to bad debt could have a significant effect on cash flow. It’s simple to arrange and you can choose an annual limit of cover of $25,000 or $50,000. To work out what amount best suits you, consider what is the maximum amount you could be owed by a single contractor at any one time.
Payment guarantee claims are generally settled within a few weeks, compared to waiting many months for settlement through a liquidation process, from which most trade creditors will only receive cents on the dollar.
Trade Credit Insurance
If your outstanding debtors are large and/or you want to insure payment default as well as insolvency, trade credit insurance could be suitable.
When a bad debt happens there is an immediate effect on cash flow, which could even lead to your own business failing. The proceeds of a credit insurance claim inject liquid funds back into your business so you can continue to pay your own bills.
In a nutshell
Your accounts receivable is probably one of the biggest assets your business has. Yet despite the best credit control and debt management practices, external factors outside your control can negatively affect this asset. If that happens, your cashflow can be substantially affected. That’s why it’s as important (if not more so) to insure your financial risk as it is to insure your other assets.

Tiling can add value and appeal to any kitchen or bathroom – when it’s correctly installed. Insurance expert Ben Rickard explains what builders can do to help mitigate the risk of tiling failure, with help from Tile Association of New Zealand founder Brendon Manson
T h e two areas in any home that are often the talking point are the kitchen and the bathrooms. This is where the most money per square metre is invested and there is no doubt that a tiled bathroom presents the wow factor. However, If poorly done, it can be a nightmare from hell.
I n February 2023, a Ministry of Building, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) regulatory reform consultation document noted:
“Poor waterproofing often results in failures, leaks and costly repairs, which would be lessened greatly by better regulation in the area… waterproofing is a minor part of overall construction costs, but accounts for the vast majority of building defect complaints and huge costs in remedial works.
“ Many building leaks stem from bathrooms and wet areas that are not properly waterproofed, which can affect the flooring and wall linings leading to mould, mildew, and rot.
“ The build-up of moisture and mould can cause health hazards such as fungal infections, allergies, and respiratory illness, including asthma.”
High failure rate
Research from Tile Association of New Zealand (TANZ), which represents approximately 270 members in the New Zealand tile industry that have a desire to promote best practice, has noted the failure rate is approximately 11%, with estimates as high as 13%. Since its founding in 2017, TANZ has counted over $300m in failures, with 89% of these being attributed to the installer.
Unfortunately, these issues may not manifest themselves for months or even years – and often the builder is left carrying the can when they do. This is because, legally and contractually, you are responsible for the services supplied to your customer, who justifiably will expect you to make it right.
However, because tiling is a highly fragmented industry, it can be difficult to pin down the responsible contractor when the problem arises. This could be because they have shut up shop, simply disappeared or weren’t properly insured in the first place (and insurance is becoming harder to obtain for these issues).
Poor sector training
Despite tile installers being responsible for 90% of all membranes applied within a bathroom, the tile industry’s focus has not always been about education and training for installers. If the tiler is not correctly trained, or the installer does not fully comprehend the importance of all aspects of the application of the membrane and the associated details, then the result can be failure.
In the past, training has been basic and has often been provided by product manufacturers, who have focused on product sales, rather than best practice requirements, with some manufacturers providing as little as 30-minute product demonstrations before issuing an ‘approved applicator/licence card’. While others have provided more extensive training programs, the result of poorly trained tilers is failed, leaky showers – even when installed by approved applicators of membranes.
Although water-stops have been a requirement of AS3740 (Waterproofing of Domestic Wet Areas) since 1989, which is noted in all BRANZ appraisals, BRANZ Good Practice Guide Tiling, and most product technical data sheets, TANZ identified the lack of water-stops as a contributing factor in almost all the failed tiled showers it has assessed.
AS3740 describes a water-stop as a vertical extension of the membrane that is designed to prevent water migrating under the tiles and to contain moisture within the shower area/wet area. It also described as an integral part of the membrane application.
TANZ is working to address the issues outlined above and provide the solutions, so that the sector can be part of the Licenced Building Practitioners regime and installers of membranes and tiles can be properly trained and licenced.
Be on the safe side
How can builders safeguard their projects and clients from risk?
1. Ensure the substrate is ready and accessible to the tiler.
Time pressure and an inadequately prepared surface often contribute to membrane failure.
2. Engage properly trained installers.
Training doesn’t come from years accrued in the industry. Just because someone has done a job for 20 years, doesn’t mean they’ve been doing it correctly. You should require that your tilers have undertaken TANZ’s T.E.A.M training programme. Visit www.tanz.net.nz for a list of upcoming courses in your area.
3. Build to code.
Ensure all wet areas are built to meet E3/AS2 requirements as per the Internal Wet Area Membranes (IWAM) Code of Practice, with the use of water-stops and wall cavity protectors to contain moisture within the shower area.
These simple steps will greatly reduce the risk of possible waterproofing failures and the associated stress, conflict and cost. The ‘wow factor’ of a beautiful, tiled bathroom is trouble-free and only adds value to the home when it is done correctly the first time.

Tradies’ vehicles are a prime target for thieves nationwide, as they contain expensive, easy-to-sell tools and are likely to be left unlocked for regular periods. Here are eight tips to help you reduce the impact of theft on your business
Fit an alarm
Although an alarm can’t actually stop a criminal stealing your vehicle, it will certainly deter them. The noise will more than likely scare them off if they make an attempt to break in.
Contact a local auto electrician about getting one installed, depending on the features, it will cost between $400-$1,000. Builtin have negotiated discounts with the following installers across the country:
Fit an immobiliser
An immobiliser prevents a vehicle from being started by someone who doesn’t have the proper key. Although it won’t stop your Ute from being broken into, it will stop it being driven away. Many new vehicles will have these fitted as standard.
Fit a GPS tracker
With a GPS system hidden in the vehicle, you’ll be able to track it down and recover it if it’s stolen. These can cost between $400 to $700, including installation, with potential ongoing fees including a monthly subscription or a pre-paid sim card.
Steering wheel lock
These robust devices are secured to the steering wheel when the vehicle is not in use. Their real value is as a deterrent to would-be thieves, who are likely to move on to an easier target. A very cost-effective option, they can be bought for as little as $15 on TradeMe (but beware of quality, as you get what you pay for).
Secure parking
Park off the street whenever possible, as your vehicle is far less likely to be stolen – this includes using your garage for what it was designed for!
If you have to park on the street outside of work, try to get a spot that is well lit and think about installing your own security lighting and cameras.
Hide valuables
Criminals will break into your vehicle for as little as a bit of loose change, so keep all valuables out of sight or take them with you.
For tradies, your signwritten vehicle is a magnet for thieves because of the potential haul of expensive tools in the back. Tinted/painted windows (if allowed) will help reduce the appeal of your vehicle, as will having robust, locked storage chests fitted. You can get these custom made or make your own.
Lock it!
Many thefts occur because the vehicle is left unlocked. It’s easy to do, especially when you and your staff are frequently having to pop back and forth to get equipment and supplies. Opportunists will grab anything they can and be gone in seconds.
Even worse, is leaving the keys in the ignition while you go in to pay for petrol or pop into the dairy! Keep your keys with you at all times and lock your vehicle when leaving it unattended.
Marking/etching
These are both ways of permanently marking your property and deterring thieves. Because clearly marked tools are much harder to sell, they’re less attractive to thieves. It also makes recovery easier.
Many tradies are now branding their tools with their LBP or mobile number, which is a great idea. PlaceMakers stores also regularly offer free engraving services in conjunction with NZ Police at its Monster Tool sales or regional trade breakfasts held throughout the year. You can purchase an engraving tool for $40, or use a soldering iron on plastic parts.
Following any of these tips will help reduce the risk of theft and avoid the cost and nuisance of being without your important business assets. The more you can do, the more secure your assets will be.

With the New Year under way, it’s a good time to ensure you have everything in place behind the scenes so that you can focus on running your business. So what’s your plan for protecting your income should you be unable to work?
If you or your partner are unable to work for a period, become seriously ill or are suddenly faced with substantial medical bills, it’s important you have a plan to ensure you can cover your costs and replace any lost income.
Some common solutions include:
Dipping into savings.
Re-mortgaging the home.
Calling on wider family for support.
Sending a non-working partner into the job market.
Relying on the public health system, ACC and/or sickness benefit for help.
For others, these are not satisfactory. In these cases, insurance is a well established and practical option.
Here’s a quick overview of the most common policies available to protect you and your family.
Income protection/loss of earnings
While ACC will cover 80% of your income if you’re injured in an accident, it pays nothing if you can’t work due to a non-accident related illness.
Perhaps surprisingly, most people, even in the construction industry, are more likely to be off work through illness rather than accident. Income protection (also known as loss of earnings) will replace your income while you’re unable to work.
For self-employed contractors, this is critically important cover. Doing it right, in combination with optimising your ACC cover, can make this a very affordable option.
For specific types of injuries, you can also choose to receive a lump sum payment.
Health insurance
Many people are happy to rely on our public health system, which is fantastic in many ways. Unfortunately, speed is not one of them and when you’re facing a serious illness, a long waiting list is the last thing you want to deal with.
With private health insurance, you’ll be referred to a private hospital and have your diagnostics, cancer treatment, surgical and/or non-surgical procedures paid for.
If you’re an employer, providing health insurance to your staff makes them more likely to stay with you (and we know good workers are important to keep hold of) as well as ensuring they’re back at work quickly if they do get sick. With the right plan, pre-existing conditions can be included, making the cover very attractive.
Key person
Are you, or is someone else in your business, critical to its successful operation? What would happen to your business if that person was unable to work?
Key person cover ensures that the operation of the business can continue (workers get paid, jobs get done) while that person is recovering, or a replacement is found.
The money can also be used to pay off debt and employees before closing the business in an orderly manner, rather than being forced into liquidation/ bankruptcy.
Life insurance
Pays a lump sum to your beneficiaries in the event of your death. In cases of terminal illness, some policies will pay out prior to your death so you can make the most of the time you have left.
Disability/trauma
Pays a lump sum on diagnosis of specified illnesses. This can be used for anything while you recover, including paying extra expenses or for alternative treatments, reducing debt, replacing a partner’s income if they have to take time off , or even going on holiday to speed up your recovery.
In a nutshell
Being sure your family will be looked after if something happens to you is vitally important to most people. The right insurance can give them peace of mind and guarantee their future financial security.
What combination of cover is right for you will depend on your own situation and the level of risk you’re comfortable with. In every case, speaking with a financial adviser will help ensure you’re making the right decision for you and your family.

TITLE   : BUILDING DEFECTS EXCLUSION

Have you ever heard of the Building Defects Exclusion? Ben Rickard, from Builtin Insurance, explains how this is an important detail to be aware of in many builders’ insurance policies
Following the leaky homes crisis of the early 2000s (many would say it is still ongoing) insurers wanted to limit their exposure to what they saw as the substantial risk of claims from external water penetration into buildings. They saw this as a risk that was just too big and too uncertain to price into ongoing coverage.
They introduced what is known as the ‘building defects’ exclusion. Here are a couple of examples from different insurers:
Building defects exclusion (from a public liability policy) We will not indemnify You for any claim under this Policy in respect of or alleging Personal Injury or Property Damage arising out of:
The failure or alleged failure of any building or structure to meet or conform to the requirements of the New Zealand Building Code contained in the First Schedule of the Building Regulations 1992 or any applicable New Zealand Standard (or amended or substituted Regulation or Standard) in relation to leaks, water penetration, weatherproofing, moisture, or any effective water exit or control system; or
Mould, fungi, mildew, rot, decay, gradual deterioration, micro-organisms, bacteria, protozoa or any similar or like forms, in any building or structure.
Building defects exclusion (from a contract works insurance policy) This policy does not insure loss in connection with a building or structure being affected by:
Moisture or water build-up or the penetration of external moisture or water, or
The action or effects of mould, fungi, mildew, rot, decay, gradual deterioration, micro-organisms, bacteria, protozoa, or any similar or like forms, that is caused directly or indirectly by:
Non-compliance with the New Zealand Building Code, or
Faulty design or faulty specification, including but not limited to faulty sequence, procedure or programme, or
Faulty materials, or
Faulty workmanship,
when the building or structure was constructed, manufactured, altered, repaired, renovated or maintained.
This exclusion does not apply to loss that is caused by or directly arises from the leakage of internal pipes, internal water reticulation systems or internal cisterns.
Breaking it down The first point is that for a liability claim to be triggered there must first be “property damage”. This generally means actual physical damage to property owned by a third party. It can also mean loss of use of property which results in a quantifiable financial cost to a third party.
To trigger this exclusion, there must be a failure or alleged failure of the building to meet the Building Code. Arguably, any external penetration that allows water into the building is a failure of E2. It can also apply to the failure to adequately apply waterproofing membranes, flashings or other essential weathertightness components.
Some interpretations have the effect of ruling out the majority of the largest potential claims from trades such as roofers and anyone installing cladding.
If the claim arises from mould or gradual deterioration, such as a slow leak that rots timber over time, then it is explicitly excluded as well.
The exclusion does not apply to internal water penetration, such as leaks from internal pipes or the failure of waterproofing in showers.
Building it versus working on it We are strongly of the view, and have been successful arguing with insurers, that this exclusion is intended to apply to the construction of new “buildings or structures” and not to situations where tradespeople are working on an existing building.
Successes For example, it should not apply if a leak happens when retrofitting a heatpump or installing a skylight to an existing building. However, you need to be aware that your policy includes this clause and that it could be relied on to decline such claims.
Failures Failing to paint the cut ends of timber weatherboards is likely to fall foul of this exclusion. A basement that leaks due to improperly installed coil drainage is another claim that is likely to fail due to this exclusion. It should be noted that just the allegation of a failure could be enough for an insurer to decline a claim under this exclusion.
In a nutshell
If your claim is due to actual or alleged penetration of external moisture or water into the building you’re not covered. However, there are circumstances where the right interpretation, and the right supporting argument, can result in a successful outcome. These complexities are one of the most important reasons for using a specialist, such as Builtin, for your insurance.

If you’ve ordered materials before a job starts, you may not be covered by your contract works insurance, because cover begins on the date work starts or the date of the policy, whichever is latest
W ith prices rising and supply chains stretched, it’s tempting for builders to pre-order materials to secure a lower price. Those materials will need to be stored somewhere, which puts them at risk of being stolen or damaged.
If the materials are for a specific job, arranging contract works insurance early won’t cover them before work starts on site. That’s because cover begins on the date of the policy or when work starts, but the latter of the two. Your insurer would need to specifically agree to this, which may be tricky if the work isn’t due to begin for weeks or months.
Ownership matters Who owns the materials could affect how they’re insured. For example, if the homeowner owns them (perhaps because they have paid your invoice –your contract would need to be clear on this point), they could look to add them under their contents insurance.
If you own the materials, they could be insured under a material damage policy. If you already have one of these, it should be simple to increase the sum insured, perhaps just for the short period of time before the job starts. Even a tools/mobile assets policy will generally also cover stock and materials, as long as they are included in the sum insured.
If you don’t have a current policy, it’s wise to take one out. If you add materials to an existing policy or take out a new one to cover them, the insurer will want to know details about how the materials are secured. For example, are they visible from the road, are they fenced off or, if they’re stored in a container, what sort of lock does it have ?
Lastly, if projects are delayed, make sure the contract works insurance is extended. If a claim happens after the end date on the policy, you may have no cover.
In a Nutshell If you’re storing materials in advance of a project starting, make sure that they are properly insured.

Builtin looks at what ‘fully covered’ really means and compares a ten-year builders guarantee to professional indemnity insurance
We often hear from builders who want to make sure they’re ‘covered for everything’.
Unfortunately, protecting yourself from every possible event is simply not possible. Like life, insurance is a balance between risk and cost.
However, there are some risks that builders can and should insure. One of those is the risk of making a mistake while carrying out your professional service as a builder/project manager.
If you’re taking out 10-year warranty cover that comes with a “defects waiver” this is a good start. It will generally protect you from having to repay the insurer’s costs to fix whatever the problem was, whether that’s with materials or workmanship you were responsible for supplying (including that of your subbies).
However, it does not mean that you’re ‘fully covered’, as there are a number of gaps you need to consider.
1. The period before the waiver kicks in
Problems are usually discovered in the first 12 months after the job is completed, before your waiver protection has started. So, the insurer still has the right to recover any claim costs from you.
2. Jobs without a ten-year warranty in place
Some projects are too small to require ten-year guarantee insurance, or could be a type of work where a guarantee isn’t available, such as commercial jobs.
3. Work not covered by the ten-year guarantee policy wording
In general terms, ten-year warranty cover is limited only to the building footprint. So, if your contract is broader than just this and the error affects something outside the footprint, not only is your client not covered, but you’re not protected either.
4. A third party’s errors
If the architect, engineer, surveyor or some other professional involved in the project (but not contracted to you) has made the error, but you’ve been joined to the legal case, it’s unlikely that you’ll have cover. You’ll have to fight this yourself, with expensive legal bills at the very least.
Where professional indemnity insurance fits in
This covers mistakes you’ve been held liable for that are alleged to cost a third party (eg, your client) money. This is a broad definition and gives you wide coverage for mistakes made by you, your team, or by consultants or subcontractors that you’re responsible for.
The trigger for cover is that the client must have experienced the loss and be holding you responsible for it. There is no cover if a claim is related to products that have failed to meet their manufacturer’s specifications.
You must have cover in place when the claim is made against you and it must have been in place continuously from before the original mistake is alleged to have been made. This is standard practice for professional indemnity insurance, which will be carried by all the professionals you work with, including architects, designers, surveyors and engineers.
Don’t assume your consultants’ cover will protect you
While most of (if not all) the professionals mentioned above will have professional indemnity insurance, most of them (if not all) will have terms and conditions that limit their liability to you if they make a mistake.
This could see you caught in the middle, for example if the site was originally pegged out wrong and the loss is $50k, but the surveyor has capped their liability at two times their fee.
Claim stats
Since making professional indemnity insurance available to builders almost ten years ago, we have helped clients with 20 claims, with an average claim cost of $68k. While professional indemnity claims are less frequent than public liability ones, they are typically much bigger.

Contract works insurance provides cover for sudden and accidental loss or damage to the works specified in the contract. This includes:
Fire
Theft
Vandalism
Construction collapse
Natural disaster – earthquake, flooding, landslip, tsunami, storm
Other accidental damage to the contract works
There are some common issues with claims under contract works insurance that builders should be aware of:
1) Faulty workmanship: Damage caused directly by defective workmanship is not covered by the policy. A common problem at claim time is deciding whether damage was caused accidentally or by faulty workmanship. If your claim is declined for this reason, you may be able to claim on your public liability policy, but only if it includes cover for faulty workmanship.
2) Scratched windows: If this is deemed to be faulty workmanship, the cost of replacement may not be covered. The typical scenario is that “someone” scratches the glass when cleaning off splashes of paint. There is a New Zealand standard for cleaning glass (NZS 103.12.6.2) and some insurers are now declining claims if these standards weren’t followed when the damage occurred. You should make your sub-contractors aware of this.
The excess for damage caused by natural hazards has increased substantially since the Christchurch earthquakes. All insurers calculate it differently and it could be a percentage of:
a)    The total contract value when complete.
b)    The value of the work completed at the time the damage occurred.
c)    The value of the actual damage.
Let’s say you’ve done $200,000 of work on a $500,000 contract when an earthquake hits, causing $20,000 of damage. Depending on what it says in your policy, the excess could be:
a)    $5,000 up to $50,000 (in earthquake-prone areas).
b)    $2,000 up to $20,000.
c)    $1,000 (the minimum excess).
Unless your contract says otherwise, you could be responsible for paying the whole excess. We recommend you specify who pays the excess in your contract.
Regardless of the end date on your policy, and depending on your insurer’s specific terms, the cover will stop on the earlier of:
Practical completion.
When the owner starts using the building.
If it’s a spec, when 95% of the budget is spent.
The end date on the policy.
So you may not have cover if the owners move in, or even just start storing their stuff in completed parts of the building. If the project is delayed, you must remember to extend the policy. Most policies include cover for the maintenance period, either automatically or as an option. This covers damage you’re responsible for that happened during the contract period but is only discovered later, or damage that happens while you’re carrying out work during the maintenance period.
If it’s a new build, most contracts will require the builder to arrange the policy. Make sure you include the value of any materials supplied by the owner/principal, and if required list the sub-contractors that need to be covered too. You should also check that the allowances, such as for demolition, removal of debris and cost inflation, reflect the requirements of your contract.
If it’s an alteration, renovation or in any way involves an existing structure, you should ensure that the owner arranges the contract works insurance. Most contracts will specify this and it’s for their protection as well as yours:
It’s best arranged by the same insurer who already covers the existing structure. The current insurer must be notified that work is going on, usually in writing, as they may decline cover if there’s a claim and they weren’t told.
If you arrange it and don’t include cover for the existing structure, or don’t arrange enough, you may be liable for any damage that occurs, say from water damage that affects other parts of the house.
These can be very convenient and cost-effective, if you build new homes that are all in a similar price range. You don’t have to apply for cover for every job, or remember to extend it if a project is delayed.
However, annual policies are not recommended if you do mainly alterations and renovations, for the reasons explained above. Annual policies come with a maximum contract value. This means contracts below this amount are automatically covered. However, any jobs that exceed this amount will have no cover at all . For those, you’ll need to arrange a separate policy.

Whether you’re a fully-fledged business Jedi or fresh-faced padawan, it’s always worthwhile checking that you have a good handle on the numbers behind your business. These seven financial indicators will help you better understand your finances
One in two construction companies fall over within three years and 77% will have closed within a decade, according to Stats NZ’s 2017 New Zealand Business Demography Statistics.
These alarming figures are slightly above the base rate, which show that 46% of all businesses fail within three years and 73% fail with ten – this will be unsurprising to many who work within the building industry and understand the risks.
From our own experience, financial failure is one of the most common reasons for a building business to fail and we also know that it is a side of their business many builders struggle to properly manage.
Most claims under a Ten-Year Building Warranty happen because the building contractor has gone bust, leaving their customers in the lurch.
Financial failure is the most common reason a building company ends up in liquidation. That’s why it’s critically important that builders have a good handle on the key financial indicators of their business. The following seven measures will help you stay on top.
Cashflow forecast
This is a monthly estimate of the cash owed to and by the business. It usually projects up to 12 months into the future.
This will show whether the business has enough money in the bank to pay its bills as they fall due. It also helps to show that while your bank balance may look healthy this week, that money is actually needed to pay bills next week.
Gross margin
This is measured in percentages and shows whether your work is correctly priced. It can also show if you’re earning enough from each project. If your gross margin is too low, raising your rates and cutting costs are steps you can take to bring it up. It should be at least 8%, and ideally it will be more.
Gross Margin = Gross Profit ($) / Total Sales ($) x 100
Debtor days
This is measured, unsurprisingly, in days and shows how long it takes, on average, for your business to collect the money it is owed by customers.
The smaller the number, the better your company is at invoicing and receiving prompt payments. On the contrary, a high number can put pressure on your business’ finances by forcing you to borrow to cover costs.
Ideally for builders, this should be under 30 days. To minimise your debtor days, you could consider offering early-payment incentives or using an invoice factoring provider.
Debtor days (days) = # of outstanding accounts / total sales ($) x 365 (days)*
*Note that if you’re changing the period you want to measure, you’ll need to change the number of days accordingly. ie, for February use 28 days, or 29 in a leap year!
Creditor days
This is basically a reverse of the debtor days calculation and is used to measure how long it takes you to pay your
creditors. It shouldn’t be more than 60 days. The higher this number, the longer it takes you to pay your bills, potentially indicating some trouble paying debts.
Creditor days (days) = # of unpaid bills / total purchases ($) x 365 (days)
Current ratio or working capital ratio
This is a percentage figure that measures whether your business has enough liquid assets (stuff that can be turned into cash quickly) to pay its short term liabilities.
A healthy business should have more current assets 1 than current liabilities 2 and if the result is less than 100%, you should look at how you can reduce your liabilities as quickly as possible.
Current ratio (%) = current assets ($) / current liabilities ($) x 100
1 This includes things such as your tools, work vehicles and any materials you have stored on site.
2 This includes money you owe suppliers and contractors, and any debts you have.
Equity ratio
This is a measure of how much of the business’ assets are financed by the owners and shareholders compared to debt (mortgages, loans etc).
The higher the percentage, the less a business is leveraged and the less of it is owned by banks and other lenders through debt.
Ideally, it should be 5% and lenders and insurers both like to see a small number as it helps determine how risky it is for them to work with a business. A business with a heavy debt load will be unattractive to lenders and can force people into riskier, high-interest finance options.
Equity ratio (%) = owner’s equity ($) / total assets ($) x 100
Solvency ratio
A solvent business will have more assets than it does liabilities, indicating it can afford to pay back everything it owes. A solvency ratio less than 100% shows the business could be in trouble and may need an injection of capital from the owners.
Solvency ratio (%) = total assets ($) / total liabilities ($) x 100
Crunching numbers
A good accountant (particularly one that understands the construction industry and can properly account for work in progress) and accounting software are vital to the financial health of any building business, regardless of size.
They will help you understand the state of your current finances on a regular basis and, just as importantly, help to identify any potential future issues before they become critical. This will give you more control over your business’ financial health, reduce stress levels and make your business more attractive to banks, warranty providers and potential buyers.

The new Code of Ethics has the potential to change your liability, but not as much as you might think. BuiltIn construction insurance expert Ben Rickard explains more
F rom October 2022, Licensed Building Practitioners (LBPs) have needed to comply with a Code of Ethics. These types of codes are common across many industries and increasingly being mandated by Government for licensed occupations, such as builders and financial advisers.
But does being subject to the code standards increase your risk of being held liable for an alleged breach ? And, if so, what are the penalties and can these be insured for ?
Since licensing became compulsory in 2012, our view has always been that holding a licence does not increase your liability. If you make a mistake, there is enough common law and legislation to ensure you’re held responsible for that, licensed or not. That’s the same for anyone operating a business or providing a professional service.
Expanded responsibilities
The differences with holding a licence are that the person who was at fault can be tracked down more easily, and that there is a system in place to censor people who fail to meet their obligations, in addition to legal remedies like court action.
The new Code of Ethics expands the number of things that a complaint can be made about to the Building Practitioners Board (the Board). The Code of Ethics has what would seem like pretty obvious stuff in it, like taking responsibility for informing and educating your clients, advising clients of delays and complying with the law.
Sounds pretty straightforward, but if you review some of the complaints to the Board over the years, you might feel differently. While there was no Code of Ethics, complaints could be laid against LBPs for ’ bringing the scheme into disrepute ’ , and most of these would also breach the new Code of Ethics.
So, could you face a licence complaint because a disgruntled client alleges that you have not ’ behaved professionally ’ ? Or that you have not priced the job ’ fairly and reasonably ’ ? Quite possibly.
Insurance cover that would pay the cost of defending a complaint, as well as any fine imposed, is available and well-priced. Some insurers will include it as part of statutory liability insurance, while others offer a standalone policy that includes additional benefits as well.
In a nutshell
Many professions are subject to a Code of Ethics, and breaches of these can be referred to a disciplinary committee. LBPs are now covered by a similar system. Insurance is available to cover the cost of defending these complaints, as well as any fine imposed.

If there’s one asset a builder will always have insured, it’s their work vehicle – and it’s important you have the correct coverage
T his month we’re talking about commercial vehicle insurance. We’ve put together some tips below to help ensure you have the right cover and are getting the best value from your policy.
Get your ‘sum insured’ correct
Make sure the ‘sum insured’ for your vehicle is set at an accurate current market value, as this figure is what your premium is based on.
Another reason to make sure it’s correct is because it’s used to determine payouts. More accurately, payouts are calculated based on which of the following is lower: the “sum insured” or the market value of the vehicle at the time of the claim.
Setting your sum insured too high over the vehicle’s market value means you’ll be paying too much, but setting it too low means you’re under-insured.
Try searching Trade Me Motors for a vehicle like yours of a similar age, condition and mileage. The sum insured is your vehicle’s market value excluding GST.
Crack your windscreen coverage
Replacing a broken windscreen is easy when you’re insured. There’s no excess or claim form to complete. Simply take the vehicle in to your nearest Smith & Smith or Novus, along with the name of your insurer and policy number. We recommend you phone ahead with your VIN number, so they can make sure a suitable windscreen is in stock.
Most policies offer unlimited windscreen cover; however, some are limited to one claim per year. Some cover all the glass in your vehicle, including canopies, while others won’t. Double check with your insurer to see what rule applies to you.
Arrange insurance for new vehicles before collection
You should make sure any vehicles are insured before you drive them off the lot, but if you leave it to the last minute you may find yourself wanting.
The best advice is to let your broker or insurer know in advance. If you already have cover in place on another vehicle, the policy may include an ‘additions and deletions’ clause. This means new vehicles will be covered for their market value as long as you tell your insurer within 30 days of the purchase (there may be an additional premium to pay).
Another reason to arrange your insurance early is in the event you need finance. The dealer will want to see an insurance certificate before releasing the vehicle.
Is signwriting covered?
Some policies will automatically include cover for signwriting, but others will only do so if it’s separately noted. Either way, we recommend you check to make sure it’s covered by your policy.
Keep your business on the road
Adding a ‘loss of use’ extension to your policy means you can hire a replacement vehicle while yours is being repaired.
There are conditions, such as extra premium, a stand-down period and maximum hire time, but these costs generally outweigh the inconvenience of being without a vehicle or having to hire one yourself.
Check staff licences
Assuming the apprentice has a licence just because they’re old enough is not good enough. It’s important for insurance purposes because conditions of insurance usually include that the driver has your consent, is legally allowed to drive the vehicle, has a current licence and is not breaching any condition of their licence while driving it.
It’s also sensible from a health and safety perspective. According to ACC: “It is your responsibility as an employer to ensure that any employee who drives any kind of vehicle is legally able to do so. That means they must have the right category of licence and it must be valid (not be suspended, expired or revoked).”
Claims registered too late may be declined
Your insurer may decline a claim if you’ve taken too long to make it. Damage that occurred six months ago may be considered pre-existing and any further loss, such as rust that has set in, may not be covered.
While insuring your vehicles and equipment is important, make sure you insure your business’ most important asset: you.
Loss of earnings insurance can broaden your protection to include disability from both illnesses and accidents at little or no extra cost. Another benefit is that your ACC levies will be reduced.

TITLE   : Landscaping risks for builders

While it may be argued that there is less risk when landscaping than when building, there are still hazards that need to be considered. Construction insurance expert Ben Rickard provides some advice
T here are many risks that can be managed by having good training and procedures in place, including.
The same applies when it comes to managing relationships with customers. Written contracts are essential to avoid misunderstandings and to provide a basis for the agreed scope of work and managing any disputes. This includes making sure that variations are also agreed in writing.
These are just a few examples of hazards that need to be managed as part of a broader risk management plan, which may also include having the right insurance cover in place.
Insurance essentials for landscaping
Public/General/Broadform liability This covers your liability for accidental damage to someone else’s property. For example, concrete splashes staining existing cladding or joinery, or heavy equipment (while being operated for its specialised purpose, not while being driven) damaging existing property.
One common pitfall to be aware of is hitting underground services when digging holes or trenches. This is covered, usually with a higher excess, but only if the appropriate measures were taken to identify the location of any services prior to digging. This may include needing to manually dig rather than using an excavator if working near such services.
Pools are another area that need to be managed very carefully, as insurance may not cover liability issues related to their construction.
If your main occupation is as a builder but you pick up a job landscaping, make sure your policy includes this activity as well – otherwise, you may not be covered.
Damage by vehicles & heavy machinery Damage to other people’s property caused by your vehicle is covered under the vehicle’s insurance, not public liability. This also applies to any items of equipment or heavy machinery that are mechanically propelled and insured as vehicles.
It is not uncommon for neighbours to complain of cracks in their houses, paths or driveways because of the operation of heavy machinery at the next door property. It’s a good idea to visit neighbours before this work starts and to get lots of photographic evidence of the condition of the existing property before commencing operation.
Contract works insurance This covers accidental damage or loss to the building work, including by theft, storm, subsidence or flood. Often not even considered for landscaping work, if this cover hasn’t been arranged and there is damage to the works under construction, a substantial loss may have to be borne by the builder carrying out landscaping.
If the work involves an existing structure, such as the addition of a deck, fencing, retaining or landscaping around a house, this cover should be arranged by the building owner with their current insurer. It is a good idea for the builder to ensure that this has been done, which will avoid any problems later on, if it hasn’t been and there is an issue. It should be a standard condition of your contract for this cover to be arranged.
If the contract involves standalone work, such as a sleepout or a freestanding deck, pergola or substantial retaining works, the builder may be able to arrange the cover separately.
Design liability If your role includes landscape design, consider professional indemnity insurance. This covers liability for errors in the design that require the client to be compensated for their loss. For instance, encroaching on neighbouring property boundaries or a lack of sufficient barriers when designing a pool.
In a nutshell
Aside from your regular business insurance (as well as cover for illness and income protection) there are particular risks with landscaping that need to be properly managed, whether with the appropriate insurance or the other risk mitigation measures outlined in this article.
The information presented in this article is general in nature and not intended to be financial advice for individual situations.

With supply chain issues causing much longer lead times for building materials, which creates further scheduling challenges, there’s a good chance that your project may be interrupted or delayed for a significant period of time. Builtin Insurance’s Ben Rickard cautions those in this scenario about potential insurance implications
A s a general rule, insurers don’t like to cover buildings that are unoccupied and the same applies to building sites that are abandoned, or where work isn’t progressing.
The reason is that there is a higher risk of claims – and of those claims being more expensive. For example, issues such as a burst pipe or other flooding may go undetected for longer, making damage worse. Abandoned sites are also at greater risk of burglary and vandalism.
That ’ s why contract works insurance generally either automatically ceases after a period of stoppage, or excludes claims from events following a period where work has stopped on site.
Here are some examples of policy wording:
1. Stoppage of work
If work at the Contract Site effectively ceases for a period of sixty (60) consecutive days, all indemnity under this Policy shall cease at 4pm on that sixtieth (60th) day and the indemnity shall only be reinstated if the cessation of work is disclosed to Us and only from the date and to the extent which we subsequently advise in writing.
2. Losses not covered
This policy does not insure loss immediately preceded by total or partial stoppage of work for longer than 90 days.
What can you do?
This means that, if you know work is going to be delayed, you should make sure your insurer is aware of this, so you’re not caught out if something does happen.
They may want to impose additional terms, such as a higher excess during the period and a requirement that the site is regularly visited until work starts up again, but at least you will be covered if something happens.
If possible, you could reschedule the work so there are no extended periods where no-one is working on site to avoid falling under these stoppage exclusions.
At the same time, you should also minimise the chances of a claim if there are going to be delays. For example:
1. Properly secure materials from theft (either on or off site).
2. Make sure anything that shouldn’t be left exposed to the weather for any length of time is protected (there are exclusions for this too).
In a nutshell
Be aware of the consequences on your insurance cover of any extended periods of stoppage on the site, and either re-schedule or keep your insurer informed if this is likely.

One year on – what’s changed for sub-contractors and how can they protect themselves?
On 6 February 2013, Mainzeal Property & Construction Limited was placed into receivership. A year on, the situation is clearer and closer to a resolution for unsecured creditors, but not by much.
After selling off Mainzeal’s assets, the company’s secured creditors will probably get their money back. However, about $70m is still owed to unsecured trade creditors — $51m for work that’s been completed and $19m for retentions. Mainzeal’s liquidators are now chasing China-based shareholders over some related party loans that were transferred to Mainzeal prior to its collapse. If the courts agree that these transactions were invalid, there could be up to $70m available to pay Mainzeal creditors, some of which will flow to former sub-contractors who are also still owed money. This action is being blocked by the related companies; however, without this money, unsecured trade creditors will see very little of what they’re owed.
The Mainzeal collapse has been a wakeup call for many sub-contractors, who are now taking precautions to reduce the risk of losing money when a principal contractor fails. These precautions include:
Proactive credit control procedures.
Payment claims that comply with the Construction Contracts Act.
Registering interests on the Personal Property Securities Register (PPSR).
Using bonds in lieu of retentions.
Payment guarantee insurance, such as Builtin’s Sub-Contractors Payment Guarantee, which pays 75% of the money owed to a sub-contractor if their main contractor goes bust.
It’s a reality that, when a company fails, many of their suppliers will be left out of pocket.
The question to consider is: if this happened to you, how much could you afford to lose and what are you doing in your business to minimise this loss?

Managing the risk that comes with doing building work is an important part of any project. Builders need to be aware of all the risks associated with the job and take steps to mitigate them. Here, insurance expert Ben Rickard discusses what insurance you need while doing renovations
E nsuring the right insurance is in place is one part of that risk management plan. There are two main policies that need to be in place when undertaking renovations – contract works insurance and public liability insurance.
Contract works insurance
This is also referred to as builders risk insurance and covers accidental damage or loss to the works under construction. House insurance may include an allowance for minor renovations, but the amount of cover will depend on the insurer and the scale of the work. Regardless, you should ensure that the homeowner has checked their policy and notified their insurer that work is being done.
With more substantial work, such as that over a specific value or involving structural work or works requiring a consent (depending on what the house insurance covers), contract works insurance needs to be arranged.
The building contract should stipulate who needs to arrange this cover and, in the case of work on an existing structure, this responsibility usually falls on the building owner. The policy should name the builder and cover subcontractors as well.
Here are some other tips to make sure you’re properly covered:
Recommend the homeowner notify their insurer when work is being done.
Follow the terms of the contract regarding who arranges the cover (this should be the homeowner in the case of renovations).
Make sure you see a copy of the policy before starting work.
Set a reminder to ensure that the policy is extended if completion is delayed.
Remember to increase the sum insured if the project cost rises.
Cover generally ends on the earlier of:
the end date on the policy, or;
the completion of the work, or;
when the owners occupy or put it into use.
The cover ends on whichever comes first.
Contract works insurance claims
Even though the homeowner has arranged the policy, it will still cover damage that the builder or a subbie has caused to the works. For example, a damaged vanity, benchtop or appliance.
You are entitled to make a claim on the policy for any accidental damage, even if you were responsible for it – that is why the insurance is in place and why you need to be named on it. In these situations, you may be responsible for the excess (refer to your contract). You can also make the claim yourself if the homeowner refuses to, which is another good reason to get a copy of the policy up front.
Faulty workmanship is excluded, as is damage caused by external water penetration due to a failure of the works to comply with the Building Code (known as the Building Defects Exclusion).
Public liability insurance
Also known as broadform or general liability insurance, this covers your liability for accidental damage to someone else’s property. It is essential when you’re working in and around a client’s existing structure, where the potential to cause damage to property outside the project works itself is much greater. For example, damaging carpets in a house where you’re renovating the bathroom, or water damage to a downstairs ceiling from a leak in a newly installed shower.
Public liability insurance won’t cover damage to property you own. That means any materials, components and appliances you supply as part of the job aren’t insured by public liability insurance, these fall under the contract works cover. The exception is if they are damaged after the contract has been completed and the works have been handed over to the client.
Public liability insurance can cover damage caused by faulty workmanship, including remediating defective work. But, as with contract works insurance, it won’t cover your liability for damage caused by external water penetration (and some insurers argue it won’t cover any water leaks).
It’s also important to note that you’re only insured for the occupation stated on your policy. So, if you’re doing a commercial refit but your policy only covers residential work, then you may have a problem. This can also apply if you undertake activities such as plumbing, roofing, tiling, waterproofing or electrical work that is outside the scope of your insured occupation.
Hidden gradual damage
When damage is discovered after the job has been completed, a claim should generally be made on the house insurance first. This is because the claim will get assessed and repaired by the house insurer, who will then seek recovery of their costs from the tradesperson involved. If a claim is made directly on the builder’s liability insurance, the cover is limited to indemnity value (ie, a depreciated value depending on how old the damaged items are), rather than replacement cost. This means the claim settlement may not be sufficient to cover the full cost of any remediation.
However, this is a tricky area as most house policies will have a very low amount of cover for claims that relate to hidden gradual damage, such as a slow leak behind a wall that causes timber to rot over time before being discovered. The house insurer may offer to cash settle the homeowner for that minimal amount, leaving them to find the rest some other way, such as pursuing the tradespeople involved. If the claim is for gradual deterioration, then it may also be excluded under the public liability insurance’s Building Defects Exclusion.
Here is an example of what this clause says:
Building Defects Exclusion
We will not indemnify You for any claim under this Policy in respect of or alleging Personal Injury or Property Damage arising out of:
a) the failure or alleged failure of any building or structure to meet or conform to the requirements of the New Zealand Building Code contained in the First Schedule of the Building Regulations 1992 or any applicable New Zealand Standard (or amended or substituted Regulation or Standard) in relation to leaks, water penetration, weatherproofing, moisture, or any effective water exit or control system; or
b) mould, fungi, mildew, rot, decay, gradual deterioration, microorganisms, bacteria, protozoa or any similar or like forms in any building or structure.
The interpretation of this exclusion can vary by insurer, so it’s important to seek good professional advice and have a solid understanding of your policy.
In a nutshell
You need to tread carefully when it comes to insurance covering renovation and alteration work. Contract works insurance must be in place, generally arranged by the homeowner with their existing house insurer. Public/general/broadform liability is also essential, as this protects you from liability for accidentally damaging other property while you are on site. Claims for damage due to water leaks can be very complicated, so having the right professional advice is crucial.

Insurance is a specialist topic. In this issue, Builtin’s Ben Rickard provides some advice on how to navigate the ins and outs yourself, or how to choose a professional to help guide you through it
Managing risk is a key part of running a business, and building is no exception. Most self-aware building business owners understand that they don’t know everything and appreciate the value of relying on other professionals. After all, you wouldn’t engineer foundations or install plumbing, because those are jobs best left up to the specialists. The same can be said for creating an insurance package.
To use another analogy, you wouldn’t trust your doctor to manage your finances, yet many people trust the local bank teller or a stranger in a call centre with their insurance!
So, what are the options for builders when it comes to choosing how to best manage their insurance?
Option 1: Do it yourself (go direct)
If you are a small business with a straightforward operation, your insurance requirements will probably be similar to thousands of other builders. The direct insurers that you see on TV all promote small business packages, including liability, tools and vehicles. Most banks also partner with an insurer and can sell insurance to their customers. Plus, you can search online and get quotes for insurance, which may or may not suit your needs.
Because you’re dealing directly with the insurer, you will be responsible for managing your own claims. When it comes to complex areas like liability, this can result in poorer outcomes than if you had dedicated claims support on your side, especially with things like faulty workmanship and professional mistakes.
It is up to you to do the research to understand the risks you face, what cover you need and what exclusions are in the policies. And to review it every year. Builtin provides many resources on its website to help builders with this research.
Pros: easy to access, quick to arrange and renew each year, can be cheaper, do it with the same insurer as your personal insurance.
Cons: dealing with a call centre, limited expertise in building, no claim support, generic policies that may not suit your needs, no annual check-up.
Option 2: Get help doing it (using a specialist)
This is a kind of hybrid option. Here, you are dealing with professionals who understand the building industry, can answer your questions and have a package of policies that are tailored for builders. However, you are still ultimately responsible for understanding the cover and deciding what policies you need.
Pros: a direct line to building industry experts, a policy package tailored for builders, good value option, full claim support.
Cons: no personalised service or full analysis of your needs, limited range of policies and insurers available.
Option 3: Have someone do it for you (using a broker)
This option suits larger businesses with more complex needs, as well as smaller businesses that prefer to have professional help rather than trying to manage it themselves.
A broker’s job is to understand and assess your particular situation and recommend an insurance package that best suits. They can coordinate with other experts and work with clients to develop business continuity and risk management programmes. They can approach multiple insurers, who all have different policy coverage, levels of service, expertise and prices.
If you own specialised equipment, have a large fleet of vehicles, work on large or unusual projects, or have specialised skills, you may need a broker to ensure you have the right cover. If you have lots of projects on the go, a broker can save you time and ensure nothing slips through the cracks.
They will also set aside time to review your needs each year, usually at renewal time, so that if anything has changed in your business operations, your insurance package can be updated to reflect this.
Most brokers are generalists, in that they will have clients across many different industries, from wineries to doctors’ surgeries to shopping malls. Others, like Builtin, focus on a particular sector, so that clients benefit from specialist industry expertise.
Pros: your own dedicated broker, a personalised needs assessment and tailored package that is reviewed each year, full claim support.
Cons: can cost more, may take longer to arrange, reliant on having a good broker, may not know your industry.
In a nutshell
Managing risk is an important part of being in business. It may not be your strong point, so it’s important that you consider working with professionals who can help. There are different options when it comes to arranging insurance and you should choose one that suits your particular situation, including the size and complexity of your business, as well as your own capability and confidence managing an insurance programme.

From January 1, 2015, new Building Act rules will require builders to disclose certain information to clients on jobs worth more than $30,000, or face a penalty. The disclosures include information about the insurance you hold and the third party guarantees you can arrange for your customer. So, what do you need to have in place and what do you need to disclose?
For insurance disclosures, regulations cite specific policies. You must specify the amount and any relevant exclusions. But how can you decide which exclusions are relevant, and what if you get it wrong?
Provides protection from hazards such as theft, accidental damage, storms, fire and natural disasters. Every job should have contract works insurance in place – contracts will require it and, if it’s a new build, builders are generally responsible for arranging it. It should name the builder, owner and sub-contractors, so all parties are covered.
For renovations, alterations or additions, usually the owner should arrange contract works insurance through their own insurance provider. Again, it should cover all the parties involved in the build.
Damage to existing structures.
Consequential loss.
Contractor’s tools.
Equipment.
Partial occupation.
Workmanship & design.
Provides protection if you’re held liable for accidentally damaging someone else’s property and, in some cases, causing injury. Every builder should have public liability insurance in place, and most modern contracts require it.
People want to know that, if their builder (or one of their subbies) causes some major damage, an insurance company with deep pockets will pay for the loss.
Faulty workmanship & materials.
Damage to the property you’re working on.
Your own products and professional advice.
Provides protection if you’re held liable for a financial loss that someone suffered, which hasn’t resulted from accidental damage (ie use of the wrong materials or failure to correctly follow a design or specification).
Today, people are more willing to take the original builder of their house to court if they’re unhappy with some aspect of it. In the past, it has been difficult for trade professionals to get indemnity cover suitable to their occupation; this is now available and more contracts are requiring it.
Property damage & injury.
Financial estimates.
Building surveys and inspections.
Faulty materials and workmanship.
Financial failure.
Another policy not specified, which is worth disclosing, is the commercial motor vehicle cover you hold – particularly third party liability, which covers damage caused by your vehicles to other people and their property.
Finally, if you have to transport components of the build from around the country or overseas, what insurance do you hold to protect those goods in transit? The biggest challenge for builders will be deciding what “relevant exclusions” they need to disclose. If there’s one good thing to come from this, it will be a greater awareness among builders of the cover their insurance provides.
Guarantee disclosures include product warranties, non-completion and defect guarantees. You must specify the time period covered and any limits or exclusions.
Builders who are members of the Master Builders Association or Certified Builders Association are able to offer their clients non-completion and defects guarantees. These guarantees last up to ten years for major defects and have varying levels of financial cover for homeowners. Builders who aren’t members of a trade association can apply for accreditation to offer their clients the Homefirst 10 Year Builders Guarantee at www.builtin.co.nz/homefirst , which is independently managed and underwritten by a licensed insurer.
These guarantees typically protect the homeowner if their builder is unable to complete the job or return to fix defects, usually because the company has been liquidated or stopped trading. It gives homeowners the peace of mind that if there is a problem, their financial investment in the build is backed by a third party.
They are also transferrable to subsequent owners, providing an attractive marketing benefit. However, they are not automatic and must be individually applied for on each job – in much the same way as contract works insurance.
The owner will receive a certificate of guarantee acknowledging their policy is in place. There are limits on the amount of cover for each section of the guarantee and their durations – two years for non-structural defects and ten years for structural defects.
Owner-supplied materials, and sub-contractors.
Consequential damage.
Works outside the building envelope.
Damage or loss covered by other insurance.
Contractual disputes.

Keeping detailed records of conversations and work done could save you if a job turns sour. BuiltIn expert Ben Rickard explains
B uiltIn is currently dealing with a claim that relates to work a builder did back in 2018. Four years after completion, the job has turned nasty and they’re being taken to the Disputes Tribunal.
The details are confidential; however, BuiltIn can reveal generalities. The client installed a floating floor in a residential home, after which the homeowner arranged for a woodburner to be installed. During installation, the homeowners screwed through the floating floor, which meant the timber was unable to expand and contract. This caused it to warp and the builder is now being held liable.
The builder had warned the homeowner of this potential issue before the woodburner was installed but, unfortunately, these warnings are not recorded in writing. If they were, it would have substantially aided his defence. BuiltIn is hopeful that the evidence is clear enough that the client will not be held liable for the damage, but this situation serves as a timely reminder that a quick email to confirm a conversation could save your bacon down the track.
Hard evidence required
In a second claim, BuiltIn’s client was alleged to have performed substandard work and an independent report identified several failings.
The client says the poor workmanship identified in the report relates to work done by different contractors after he suspended work at the site. However, he has not been able to present any evidence to support this assertion, such as photos of his work or the status of the job at the time he ceased work. Without his own evidence and, in the face of the independent report, he has so far been unsuccessful in challenging the claims against him.
In a nutshell
Keeping written records may seem like a pain at the time but could save your bacon if a job comes back to bite you later.
The information presented in this article is general in nature and not intended to be financial advice for individual situations.

Tools theft is increasingly common and if it hasn’t happened to you yet, you’ve probably heard of someone you know who it has happened to. That’s why insurance expert Ben Rickard is urging all builders to take extra measures to secure their tools
So, what can builders do to reduce their risk of tool theft? There are a number of effective measures you can take to keep your tools and equipment safe.
1A. Prevention of theft from site
• Keep items on site only when absolutely needed.
• Keep tools and equipment secured in heavy-duty lockable containers when stored onsite. Check out armorgard.co.nz for some good options.
• Don’t leave tools in the open, where they have a higher chance of tempting opportunist thieves.
• Mark your tools in a highly visible way as a deterrent to theft.
• Install motion-sensing cameras, alarms and/or lights that will notify you or a monitoring service of any activity.
1B. Prevention of theft from vehicles
• Secure trailers with a towball lock and/or wheel clamp, so they can’t be stolen (with all your tools on board).
• Don’t park your vehicle on the street unattended and loaded with tools (and always lock it)!
• Install Armorgard-style secure drawers or boxes in your vehicle. These are a great deterrent to opportunist thieves.
• Fit your vehicle with an antitampering alarm.
• Place stickers on your vehicles, warning that power tools stored inside are marked and GPS tagged.
Contact ben@builtin.co.nz for free stickers.
2. Tracking
• Install GPS tracking chips.
3. Replacement/Recovery
• Keep a register of your tools. This will help the Police if they are recovered, as well as making an insurance claim much quicker. There are useful apps to help you do this, such as hoist.world or toolprotect.com.au , although a simple Google Sheet can do the job just as well. The information that should be recorded includes:
• Tool description.
• Serial number.
• Date of purchase.
• Cost.
• Where purchased.
• Copy of receipt/ invoice.
• Photo of item.
Engrave your tools with your mobile, driver’s licence or LBP number as an identifier. This is how the Police are able to connect recovered tools with their rightful owners, it can also act as a deterrent for opportunist theft in some cases.
Use tracking technology, such as SelectaDNA selectdna.co.nz . Make sure you have good tools insurance.
The key considerations are:
• Replacement value cover (new for old regardless of age).
• What the burglary and theft excesses are.
• Is theft from vehicles covered?
• Is the claim process going to be quick and easy?
Tools insurance
Premiums are not as expensive as you may think, although the current high volume of claims is putting pressure on rates. Here are our top tips to make sure you’re getting the cover you need:
If your tools are stolen, for a claim to go smoothly, you will need to provide:
• A completed claim form (easy).
• Police acknowledgement (easy).
• Proof of ownership of the stolen items (easy, if you have done the work up front to record all this).
• Quote to replace them (easy).
The biggest reason for a delayed payment for a tools claim is the time it takes for the policyholder to try and dig up proof of ownership, so if this is taken care of in advance, the process is very quick and easy.
Replacement value vs Indemnity value
Replacement value cover will replace stolen items with brand new ones, regardless of their age or condition when pinched. Beware, some policies that claim to be for replacement value will revert to market value on items more than a few years old, so check the fine print. With indemnity value policies, you’ll only get what the item was worth when it was stolen (eg, its depreciated value) and you have to make up the difference.
Trailers
These should be insured as commercial vehicles; they can’t be insured under a tools policy.
Theft vs Burglary
Tools policies make a distinction between theft and burglary. Theft is generally considered to be when an item is stolen “in the open air” – that is, without any sign of forced entry. So, it would be considered theft if tools were stolen from an unlocked van or site but burglary if locked doors were forced or a window smashed to gain entry. Some policies include burglary but not theft in the open air and you need to understand what you’re getting. At least one insurer won’t even cover tools stolen from a locked vehicle (unless the tools are secured within a lockable container inside the vehicle).
Cover for tools in vehicles
Some policies increasingly exclude cover for theft from a vehicle. This can be an issue, because often vehicles have to be accessed by multiple workers throughout the day, so they tend to stay open or unlocked while onsite. Builtin’s tools cover allows for this.
Know your excess
Even if your policy does include theft in the open air, theft excesses differ. The policy might advertise a $500 excess, but it’s common to see a $1,000 excess for burglary and $2,500 for theft. You can find policies with options for lower excesses. Builtin has a $1,500 excess for theft. Builtin’s burglary and theft excess drops to $500 if an Armorgard secure storage box is installed.
In a nutshell
Having your tools stolen can be a massive inconvenience, cause delays and cost money. Taking preventative measures, keeping good records and having the right insurance cover will ensure that if something does happen, you can get back to work quickly and not be out of pocket. You can get an instant quote for tools cover at: builtin.co.nz/tools.

Despite employers’ best efforts to keep everyone safe on site, sometimes accidents happen. Builtin outlines what type of insurance could help you in such an instance.
Enforcement actions in the construction industry for inadequate height protection, which range from written warnings to prohibition notices to penalties and prosecution, have risen nearly 500% in the past three years. However, prosecutions have fallen 90%.* This is largely due to the “falls from height” campaign and more proactive action by inspectors. Unfortunately, construction is still in New Zealand’s top five for the highest number of workplace fatalities.
The vast majority of builders we deal with recognise the importance of good health and safety practices. However, most also subscribe to one or more of the following views:
Regulation is over the top.
Compliance costs are a heavy burden on a small business.
There’s no personal responsibility anymore.
Whether you agree with the new regulations or not, the reality for everyone is that ensuring workplaces are safe is non -negotiable. Unfortunately, despite the best intentions of employers, things sometimes happen that are beyond their control. If an injury occurs and a WorkSafe NZ investigation determines that it could have been prevented, you could face a fine and/or prosecution. Under the current law, workplace bullying (discussed on Page 14) is also considered a hazard, and failure to prevent it could be a breach of the law.
New legislation has recently been introduced that is expected to replace the Health & Safety in Employment Act with the Health & Safety at Work Act later this year. Among other things, this will:
Increase penalties.
Clarify that your responsibility is not just for your employees, but also for sub-contractors, employees of sub-contractors, hired labour, apprentices, workers on trial and volunteers.
Highlight that you’re also responsible for them wherever they go when they are at work – for example, if they need to drive down to the merchant to pick up some materials.
Put more onus and legal requirements on managers and company directors to manage risks and keep their workers safe.
Although the law specifically states that you can’t insure against fines under health and safety legislation, you are able to get insurance for the legal costs of defending an action and for reparation payments that may be awarded.
“Whether you agree with the new regulations or not, the reality for everyone is that ensuring workplaces are safe is non -negotiable
Known as statutory liability insurance, it provides protection for:
The legal defence costs associated with breaches of most legislation, including the Building Act, Consumer Guarantees Act, Fair Trading Act, Resource Management Act, Health & Safety in Employment Act and others (but excluding criminal and tax statutes).
The costs of an investigation or inquiry.
Fines or penalties you may be required to pay under these acts (except for health and safety fines).
In addition to legal and investigative costs, examples of fines you may be exposed to include:
Building without a consent when required – maximum fine $200,000.
Complaint to the Building Practitioners Board – maximum fine $10,000.
Breaching the Resource Management Act – maximum fine $600,000, plus $10,000 per day.
And new fines are regularly being introduced, such as:
Building without a written contract when required – maximum fine still to be confirmed.
Failure to supply a pre-contract declaration – maximum fine still to be confirmed.
As we become more regulated ( let’s face it, this is a one-way train) and enforcement increases, it’s worth thinking about having insurance to cover this risk.
“Although the law specifically states that you can’t insure against fines under health and safety legislation, you are able to get insurance for the legal costs of defending an action, and for reparation payments that may be awarded

Cyber-attacks are becoming a genuine threat to Kiwi trade businesses. Have you taken the simple steps needed to protect your electronic records, email, banking and invoicing data from viruses, hacking or ransomware?
A ttacks on small businesses have skyrocketed in the past 12 months, as hackers target poorly protected systems for ransom.
In May 2016, hackers took control of a number of email accounts belonging to New Zealand building businesses and sent out fake invoices to their clients.
In one case, a Christchurch woman lost more than $25,000 after she received what appeared to be an email from the building company repairing her earthquake-damaged home asking her to make a payment into a different bank account because the company’s usual account was being audited.
The fraud was only detected when, around two weeks later, she met with her builders who wanted to know why the invoice hadn’t been paid.
The money was unable to be recovered, as it had been transferred to an overseas bank account.
An IT specialist found that the builder’s company email had been hacked by someone in Nigeria. It was not an isolated incident; police reported that several other Christchurch businesses – including two other building firms – had been hacked.
Duped customers ended up handing over more than $100,000 in total, but about two-thirds of it was later recovered by the respective banks.
Why builders?
It appears scammers are targeting builders because they are more likely to send invoices for large, one-off amounts.
While most builders might assume this won’t happen to them, it’s worth considering the following:
You’re now more likely to become a victim of a cyber-attack than a burglary.
In 2015, more than half of all crime in the UK was computer-enabled and cyber-crime is becoming easier to do, more aggressive and more sophisticated.
In the same year, cybercrime cost New Zealand businesses more than $250m, with the number of incidents globally growing 38% year-on-year.
All it takes is a click on a link in an email, a website that looks legitimate or through a Facebook post and you’ve infected your computer or mobile device.
Hackers can then send your customers false invoices, try to hack your bank accounts or even shut down your systems and demand a ransom (often up to thousands of dollars) to release your files.
There are some simple steps you can take to minimise your risk of exposure to a cyber-attack, including some basic training for you and your staff.
How to protect yourself
Do you have up-to-date virus, firewall and malware software running ?
Microsoft provides a free product and there are other well-known providers such as Norton, McAfee and Kaspersky. Consider also the following questions:
Do you have a password set up on your computer and pin number for your phone ?
Who else has access to your computer and devices, and are you confident they wouldn’t accidentally infect it by clicking on a dodgy link ?
Are sensitive files locked or protected ?
How strong is your email password and is it the same as your internet banking one ? If they support two-factor authentication (a method of confirming a user’s identity by utilising a combination of two different components, such as a password and fingerprint recognition software) you should consider this.
Do you back up all your files to an external drive or remote location ? You can schedule these in Windows or have your IT provider set one up for you.
How would your reputation be affected if your customers were targeted by a hacker posing as you ?
Further measures
To ensure you’re as prepared as possible to prevent cybercrime, consider having an independent specialist audit your systems. However, if the worst does occur, there is also good insurance available, which provides immediate professional support to get you back up and running quickly, as well as reimbursing your losses.

Would it surprise you to know that hire contracts for scaffolding commonly require the builder to accept full responsibility for loss, theft or damage to it? BuiltIn expert Ben Rickard explains more
H ire contracts may require you to insure the scaffolding during the hire period. So, if you haven’t taken cover out via the hirer, then you’ll need to arrange your own insurance while it’s in your care. Here’s an example of the wording you might encounter:
The hirer agrees to accept full responsibility for the safekeeping of the equipment and indemnify the hire company for all loss, theft or damage to the equipment, however caused, whether or not such loss, theft or damage is caused by any negligence, failure or omission of the hirer. The hirer agrees to insure the equipment against loss and damage during the hire period and provide evidence of such insurance to the company upon request.
How can you comply with this requirement?
Within most contract works insurance policies there’s an optional extension to add cover for hired or borrowed equipment, including scaffolding. As it’s an optional extension, you need to ask for it and it will come with an additional premium.
If you have your own material damage or mobile assets policy covering your contents, tools and equipment, that policy will also commonly include cover for hired items.
In both cases, the policy limits must be sufficient to cover the replacement of the scaffolding if a claim needs to be made.
Shouldn’t my liability insurance cover this?
General/public liability policies include cover for property in your care, custody or control, but only if you would be legally liable for its loss or damage anyway. You’re not covered for any additional “contractual liability” contained in the hire contract.
For example, if your own actions damaged the scaffolding then you’d be liable in law and it should be covered by your liability insurance. But, if it was damaged in an earthquake, you wouldn’t be legally liable for that, so your liability insurance wouldn’t cover it, even though you had contractually agreed to be responsible for loss or damage “however caused”.
In a nutshell
If you’re hiring scaffolding, make sure you know what the terms and conditions of the agreement are and if you’re responsible for insuring it.

Yet more obligations on builders? Read more on MBIE’s review of insurance requirements
MBIE is currently reviewing aspects of New Zealand’s building system as part of the largest proposed building reform since 2004. Part of this review includes how risk is allocated across the various players in the sector.
One recommendation would: “Require that a guarantee and insurance product is put in place for all residential new builds and significant alterations. Homeowners would be able to actively opt out of having a guarantee and insurance product.”
If implemented, only builders who can offer this “guarantee and insurance product” would be able to build residential homes or do major alterations. Where this line is drawn hasn’t been decided yet, but the three suggestions are:
Alterations over $30;
Alterations over $100k; or
Alterations involving structural  or weathertightness work.
In other words, builders who can’t access this insurance would only be able to work on smaller residential projects or subcontract to another builder that can.
What could this mean for you?
As it currently stands, there are four ways you could comply with this new rule:
Join the Registered Master Builders Association.
Join the New Zealand Certified Builders Association.
Become accredited with Builtin Insurance.
Register and be approved by Stamford Insurance.
Each option has its pros and cons, but all have membership or assessment criteria you must meet before accessing their guarantee or insurance product.
According to MBIE’s discussion document “builders who don’t offer a guarantee and insurance product would face financial penalties. Related obligations would be included in the licensed building practitioner scheme requirements.”
MBIE estimates that taking out such a policy adds around 1% to the cost of each build. It is suggested that this be passed onto the homeowner, who is the beneficiary of the policy. They believe that this extra cost is more than made up for by the benefits. These are primarily:
Insurers’ compliance requirements would increase quality and financial solvency standards across the industry.
Losses suffered by BCAs and individual homeowners from building failures would be reduced, as these would be covered by insurance.
BCAs would be responsible for monitoring compliance with this new system and registering policies on  the LIM.
Why is MBIE recommending this change?
Their main aim is to ensure homeowners are better protected if something goes wrong with their building work. MBIE’s research showed that homeowners have a low understanding of the risks they face.
This may mean that they fail to take adequate steps to manage their risks. They estimate that fewer than half of all new builds and major renovations have any form of independent guarantee or insurance in place.
The two primary risks faced by homeowners are:
That their building work isn’t completed due to the builder going out of business.
That their finished house or renovation work will have defects.
Currently, both the Consumer Guarantees Act and Building Act provide significant protections for homeowners, including implied warranties that make the builder responsible for defective building work for up to ten years. However, statistics show that many building companies simply don’t survive to be around if/ when a problem arises that far down the track. And these laws don’t provide any protection if the building company goes bust during the build either. This has led to the recommendation that a guarantee or insurance product become a requirement, with homeowners able  to opt out if they wish.
This system is common overseas, with most Australian states requiring some form of warranty insurance. In the UK it is compulsory by default, as banks won’t lend for new residential builds without one.
At two-year transition period
If this proposal gets the green light, changes would need to be made to the Building Act and to regulation. There would be a two-year transition period to allow builders to secure a suitable guarantee or insurance product.
It should be noted that similar proposals have been floated to and by the government of the day for ten years. There is a political consideration to any change that would add to the cost of building houses, so whether or not these recommendations ever make it into law is a big question.
In a nutshell
MBIE’s main aim is to ensure homeowners are protected if something happens during their project, or if defects arise later. They are concerned that the current approach of mandatory disclosure requirements is not increasing the uptake of this type of insurance. MBIE’s proposal is to legally require all builders that want to do new residential construction and major alterations to provide a guarantee or insurance product (homeowners will be able to opt out). Builders who can’t meet insurers’ standards will not be able to do this type of work directly for the public. This is only a proposal for now and no decisions have been made.

Should I cancel my insurance to save money in a recession? This is a fair question, as people look to reduce costs in anticipation of an economic slowdown. In this article, Builtin reviews different types of insurance, potential areas for saving and the impact of cutting, or reducing, each type
The value of insurance is that you pay a predictable, regular amount (the premium) to protect you from a large, unexpected, unbudgeted cost that would severely affect your financial situation if it happened.
In tough economic times, a big, costly, unforeseen event can be much harder to recover from. This is because you may not have the same level of savings or ability to borrow as when the going is good. This makes having insurance during a slowdown even more important!
We believe that instead of seeing your insurance premium as a cost that can be cut back, think of it as an investment you’re making to protect yourself from an even bigger, unexpected cost.
However, if this is something you’re considering, the real question you should be asking is: what risks am I prepared to take on myself rather than being insured for?
Here are some things to consider as you review your spending on insurance.
PUBLIC LIABILITY AND PROFESSIONAL INDEMNITY These policies protect you if you (or someone else you’re responsible for) makes a mistake that causes a third party a loss and they hold you responsible. Mistakes can happen anytime and, by their nature, are unexpected, so you can’t plan for them. The worst ones can be very costly, so unless you have put aside a big pile of money to cover this possibility, insurance is a good investment.
Secondly, having a break in cover is not recommended, as this can have consequences down the line.
With public liability insurance, the trigger for a claim is when the damage happens, which in some cases could be months or years after you completed the job (eg, a water pipe installed incorrectly and bursting or an electrical fire). To have cover, the policy must have been in place at the time the damage occurred, but does not have to be in place when you are notified of the claim.
With professional indemnity insurance, the trigger is when you are notified of the claim, so you need to keep cover in place even after the job is finished. If you cancel it or have a break in insurance between the event (such as someone employed by you misinterpreting a design, causing financial loss) and being notified of the claim, you will have no cover at all.
Homeowners that are under financial stress can be more likely to kick off a dispute. We have seen situations where a builder’s customer made up issues with workmanship to get out of paying bills. The right insurance will cover your legal costs in the event of allegations of damage or professional negligence.
Savings can be made at renewal time if you anticipate your turnover (gross income) being lower, as premiums are based on turnover. Bear in mind there are minimum premiums and different insurers calculate premiums at different levels, so a small drop (or increase) in turnover may not affect your premium if you still sit within the same turnover band.
EMPLOYEE DISPUTES LIABILITY If you think you may have to make changes to your employment relationships, cut hours or lay off staff in the coming months, employee disputes liability cover is worth investing in, if you don’t have it already. This protects you from claims of unfair dismissal, discrimination, harassment and other situations where a disgruntled ex-employee may take a case to the Employment Relations Authority.
STATUTORY LIABILITY This covers your liability for fines and penalties under law. One of the main benefits is that it covers the legal costs and reparations awarded for prosecutions under the Health & Safety at Work Act, however it cannot legally insure WorkSafe fines though.
It’s not clear yet how WorkSafe will approach breaches of the tough new guidelines for managing Covid-19 exposure on site. A potential worst-case scenario could see someone contract the disease from a site then pass it on to someone else, perhaps an older person or someone with respiratory issues, who dies. Could this trigger a WorkSafe investigation? If a breach of good practice guidelines was found, could this lead to a prosecution?
VEHICLE These are valuable assets for most people. An accident that is your fault can also expose you to the cost of repairing other vehicles or property involved.
One way to optimise your premium is to ensure your business vehicles are insured for their current market value, not how much they were worth three years ago, and that the amounts insured are excluding GST (the insurer will add this on in the event of a claim).
You could also reduce your cover from full/comprehensive to third party, fire and theft, or even third party only. However, this will leave you responsible for cost of damage (or theft or fire) to your own vehicles.
TOOLS AND EQUIPMENT At the best of times, tool theft is fairly common. In an economic downturn, not only is theft more likely, it could also be harder to afford to replace your stolen ones. You may have to settle for cheap alternatives, and any time you’re off the job due to being without them is costing you money too.
If you can’t afford to insure your tools, you may want to consider what security measures you have in place to reduce the chances of them being pinched. Are they stored in the back of your ute parked on the street? Is your garage alarmed?
LIFE, HEALTH, MORTGAGE AND INCOME PROTECTION The value of these policies doesn’t change in a recession. In fact, if your policy includes cover in the event of redundancy, you are probably a lot less worried than many at the moment.
The benefits of the others are also in many ways greater at this time. Alternative employment may be difficult to find if you get sick and have to get off the tools, and the financial burden on your family if you died could be even harder to bear.
If the premium is too high to afford at the moment, review your policy. It may be able to be adjusted by changing the level of income you’re insuring for, or extending your stand down periods.
PAYMENT OPTIONS Many insurers and brokers (through premium funding services) offer monthly payment plans that allow you to spread the cost throughout the year. They typically come with fees and interest, but the cashflow benefit of not having to pay all at once can outweigh the extra cost.
IN A NUTSHELL Insurance may seem like a cost that can be cut, but make sure you think through the implications of doing so. There are alternatives to cancelling policies, like adjusting cover amounts, revising turnover estimates and switching to a monthly payment plan. Before you do anything, ask yourself the question “What risks am I prepared to take on myself rather than being insured for?”

Once again, the Ministry of Innovation, Business and Employment is looking into the feasibility of making it compulsory for builders to take out insurance to protect homeowners – Builtin reviews the pros of such a system, plus the likelihood of it being introduced this time around
A builder’s warranty (also known as a builder’s guarantee or home warranty) protects a homeowner’s financial investment during construction, as well as covering defects for up to ten years. Examples of schemes currently offered in NZ include those provided by the Registered Master Builders Association (RMBA), New Zealand Certified Builders (NZCB) and Builtin’s Homefirst Guarantee.
Nothing new
First mooted at the height of the leaky homes crisis in 2009 by then Building and Construction Minister Maurice Williamson, it was proposed that homeowners could opt out of the scheme if they felt it was not needed.
The idea was dropped in 2011 but picked up again two years later, when a system based on the Australian model was proposed. However, once again, a compulsory system was dropped in favour of an education-based approach encouraging homeowners to choose whether or not they took out a guarantee.
What’s changed?
Most recently, the possibility of builders warranty insurance becoming mandatory in New Zealand is less a result of the government wanting to protect homeowners and is more due to a desire to cap the liability councils can face for defective building work.
However, capping council liability exposes homeowners to the risk of being out of pocket, if other parties, such as the builder, aren’t around to contribute their share to the cost of repairs. That’s why the Law Commission recommended compulsory builders warranty insurance would have to be introduced alongside any capping of council liability.
What are the odds?
To date, the government has been unwilling to go this far, opting to keep the current liability framework and using compulsory disclosure statements to increase awareness of builders guarantee insurance among homeowners, so that they can choose whether or not to take it.
However, anecdotal evidence suggests many builders aren’t following the new disclosure rules, and awareness of builders guarantees among the public remains low. They can also be a difficult sell for builders – who wants to recommend their customers take out insurance in case they go bust or their workmanship isn’t up to scratch?
While that’s part of the reason a mandatory approach makes sense, it means that all builders and ultimately, all homeowners pay for the poor performance of a few bad operators.
Are they a good idea?
The Building Act makes builders responsible for their work through implied warranties for up to ten years, so, you might ask, why is compulsory insurance needed on top of this?
The reality is that our construction industry is a volatile one, with lots of competition, low barriers to entry, low margins and, in many cases, building firms run by people who lack business and financial management skills (an aspect of building the LBP scheme doesn’t address).
Failure is inevitable for some, with customers and suppliers often bearing significant losses. That’s really where independent builders guarantees come to the rescue, at least for homeowners.
If they’re compulsory, a builder who can’t get one because they aren’t up to scratch won’t be able to build. Here at Builtin, we believe this will make it harder to be part of the industry and help to weed out poor performers, which has to have a positive effect on the overall health of the sector.
Where can you get one?
Members of RMBA can provide a Master Build Guarantee, which is self-insured and operated by Master Build Services, a business owned and controlled by RMBA. They have a range of guarantees to choose from, with varying levels of cover.
NZCB members are required to provide Halo Guarantee Insurance, which is managed by a broker and underwritten by a cover holder at Lloyds of London.
For builders who are not a member of either of these two trade associations, or for members who wish to provide an alternative, Builtin Insurance is New Zealand’s leading independent provider of builders guarantees.
A free pre-approval process means only builders who meet standards for construction management practices, qualifications, skills and experience, on-site quality control and financial solvency can provide Builtin guarantees.
Builtin Accredited Builders can choose from a range of ten-year guarantees to suit their business, including:
The full Homefirst Guarantee that comprises both pre-completion financial risk and defects cover for new builds, alterations and additions.
A Defect Repair Guarantee for builders doing specs or turnkey homes.
A Small Project Guarantee for jobs under $30,000.
Builtin’s guarantees are underwritten by CBL Insurance, a New Zealand-based, A-rated insurer. CBL has more than 40-years’ experience and insures over five million homes worldwide, including more than $2bn worth of residential property here in New Zealand.
Protection for the builder
Both the Halo and Builtin guarantees include a “waiver of subrogation”. This is a powerful benefit, as it gives the builder protection from the cost of fixing defects if a claim is made under the guarantee after the first 12 months.
In this situation, the insurer fixes the defects without seeking recovery of their costs from the builder. However, they may go after other parties, such as product manufacturers and subcontractors, if they are deemed responsible for the problem.
A final word
As to whether they’ll become compulsory here any time soon, your guess is as good as ours. With an election looming and major political challenges to anything that could increase the cost of building houses, it may take a change of government, or another major industry failure, before mandatory building warranty insurance becomes a reality.
In the meantime and despite this, given their very reasonable cost for the protection they give, an independent builders guarantee makes good sense for customers and builders alike.

Builtin highlights three important issues that could affect your contract works insurance cover
A s with any contract of insurance, the devil is in the detail and it’s important you read and understand the terms and conditions contained within it. Below are three things you may not be aware of that could affect your cover.
Cessation of Work
Most policies exclude cover for loss or damage caused by, or connected to, cessation of work, which could occur for a number of reasons.
You could be building your own home in stages; have a bust up with the owner and walk off site; get injured and can’t work; or any other delay. If it results in you not being able to continue work on site for a period of time, the policy may not cover any damage or loss that subsequently occurs.
The interpretation of whether work has ceased, and whether the damage or loss is connected to it or caused by it (directly or indirectly), is down to your insurer. Different insurers have different wordings around cessation of work, so if it’s likely that your project will be interrupted by periods where no work is going on, speak to your insurer about how it may affect your cover.
Existing Structures
If you have an annual contract works policy, it may not include any cover for damage to existing structures.
If you’re doing a new build and there is a garage, retaining wall or septic tank on site, your contract works policy would not cover loss or damage to these.
The same applies to project specific contract works policies if you do not include cover for any existing structures on the site.
Make sure before you start any project that you consider what existing structures on site may need to be insured during the build.
Earthworks and foundations
All too often we hear from builders who want to arrange contract works insurance because “we’re ready to put the framing up”. They did not think they needed insurance for the earthworks or foundations because “what could happen to these ? ” However, significant flooding, landslips, collapse and earthquakes are all hazards that could substantially damage earthworks, retaining and foundations, and therefore should be insured for during this phase of the work.
Secondly, there is no significant saving to be had by arranging the cover later in the job, as the premium is largely based on the total value of the work, not the length of the policy.
Not arranging cover until after the work has started can also be more expensive, more difficult to arrange and can cause banks to delay releasing progress payments. So save yourself the hassle by doing it before the work begins.
In a nutshell
Consider the effect on your insurance cover if you have to cease work on site for any reason.
If there are existing structures on site before you start work, determine whether they need to be insured.
Remember to arrange cover before you start work, as there’s usually no benefit or saving in delaying it.
Remember to arrange cover before you start work, as there’s usually no benefit or saving in delaying it

When there are design mistakes, who can be held liable – the builder or the designer? Construction insurance expert Ben Rickard explores the question in detail below
A close relationship between architect and builder during the design of a building can often solve future problems before they arise. The same applies during the construction phase. But what liability does a builder face for failures in the design of a construction project ?
There are varying opinions on this. On the one hand, some insurers say that if a builder wasn’t involved in creating the design, then they have no liability for errors in it. This is cited as a reason for builders not requiring professional indemnity insurance to cover their liability for errors and omissions in design.
On the other hand, rulings handed down by the Weathertight Homes Tribunal indicate that a builder may, in some cases, be expected to know if a particular design detail isn’t going to work. In these examples, builders must avoid building a defective design as specified. They also must ensure it is corrected.
Sometimes plans do not provide the level of detail required to implement design details on site, so builders are responsible for filling in the blanks or finding and following the appropriate manufacturer’s installation guide.
Most good practitioners will ensure that variations to the design, or required details, are signed off in writing by the architect before doing the work. However, this is not always possible and there can be unforeseen issues or defects in the design that aren’t evident during construction. So, what happens then ?
There is no limitation to who can be dragged into a legal action. As we saw through the leaky homes crisis, even a labour-only builder can be joined to a case by a plaintiff seeking compensation.
It is quite possible, even likely, that the main contractor on a building project with design issues is going to be caught up in the resulting legal dispute. Depending on their level of responsibility, the cost could range from legal fees to a substantial share of the damages awarded.
What can a builder do?
There are several steps a builder can take to reduce the likelihood of disputes, including:
Clear contractual terms concerning design will assist in deflecting liability to where it properly sits.
Ensure all design details and variations are signed off in writing by the architect.
Don’t assume! Check specifications and the latest manufacturer installation guides.
Make sure your workers and subbies are properly trained on the correct process for making changes and following the correct specifications.
Is insurance available?
A typical public/general liability policy will exclude defective “design, plan or specification”. However, if physical damage results from the defective design, then this resultant damage is covered.
Builders who have responsibility for design may want to take out professional indemnity insurance. This is available and appropriate for design and build businesses as well as other builders who have liability for mistakes in design.
In a nutshell
It is wishful thinking that builders won’t be caught up in a dispute if there is a problem with the design of a project. Working closely with the architect and ensuring they sign off any changes; good training and processes and, in the right circumstances, having professional indemnity insurance can mitigate the risk to builders if something goes wrong.

Share…
Last month, we provided a simple framework to help you manage property risks in your business. In our second article in a four-part series, we focus on liability
Construction is a risky business, more so than most, yet many builders don’t spend enough time really understanding their risk environment and putting in place strategies to manage, avoid or transfer that risk.
Property
Liability
Financial
Personal/Family
Many builders worry more about “liability” than they do about crashing their car, experiencing a fire or suffering a break in – yet their liability insurance is likely to be less adequate than for all those scenarios. In many cases, the actual cost of a liability claim can be even greater!
When caused by an accident, this is generally covered by ACC and is paid through your levy. Illness or injury not caused by a specific event may not be covered by ACC. There are a number of things you can be held liable for:
As an employer, your staff may hold you responsible for their injury or illness.
If a member of the public is injured, or becomes ill, you may be held responsible for this.
As a person responsible for site safety, you can be held responsible by Worksafe NZ.
There are many experts in the health and safety field who can advise builders how best to manage this risk. Worksafe NZ also provides a guide for employers on managing health and safety on the www.business.govt.nz site.
While you can’t insure for health and safety fines, you can cover the cost of a prosecution and any reparations awarded to the injured party. You can also insure against an employee’s ongoing costs if you’re found responsible for their illness, or injury, and it’s not covered by ACC.
You will have a detailed site health and safety plan to protect people from injury (and yourself from liability). But do you conduct the same assessment, including briefing your staff and sub-contractors, when it comes to the risk of property damage?
Ask yourself:
What activity could result in damage to neighbouring property (eg high winds, heavy vehicles, subsidence)?
If you’re doing an alteration or renovation, what activity could cause damage to the existing structure (eg climbing on roofs, dust contamination, moving materials around)?
Have I identified where underground services are located?
Have I secured the site if poor weather is likely?
Am I following the best practice standard for this particular activity (eg cleaning glass, doing hot work)?
Am I comfortable with my workers’ and sub-contractors’ practices and workmanship?
Remember, with public liability insurance, you’re not just insuring to fix damage if it occurs, you’re insuring your liability for the damage. For it to be a claim, your liability must be established first. But, just as with a car accident, it’s not your responsibility to determine whether you were liable – if you want your insurer to pay, you need to let them decide that for you.
This is the fastest-growing area of liability in the construction sector, driven by new legislation and greater awareness, and willingness, among the public to use the legal process when a problem arises.
You can be held liable if you make a mistake that causes someone an economic loss. The same applies to designers, engineers, surveyors, lawyers, accountants and insurance brokers or anyone providing a professional service. For this reason, it’s important to consider the following:
Is the advice I’m giving correct?
Have I double checked the information I’ve been given (eg site layout, wind zone)?
Is my team following the plans and specifications correctly?
Am I using the right materials, as specified in the contract?
Am I managing the project adequately?
Do I have written authority for any changes I make to the specifications (eg design changes)?
Am I happy with my team’s workmanship?
You’re responsible for your work for up to ten years, including to subsequent property owners.
If you, or one of your team, makes a mistake (or even if this is just alleged) you may want to be insured for the cost of defending yourself. The cover is called errors and omissions indemnity (or professional indemnity) – it covers you for acts, errors or omissions that cause someone an economic loss (where there’s no physical property damage or loss.) For more information, visit: www.builtin.co.nz/EandO .
Anyone in business is subject to laws and regulation, including potential fines if you’re found in breach of those laws.
The Building Act, Health and Safety in Employment Act, Fair Trading Act and Resource Management Act are just a few that relate to construction.
Fines under health and safety legislation can’t be insured for, but the policy will cover the defence costs of a prosecution and reparations. Ask yourself the question: “Am I complying with all the laws and regulations that apply to what I do?” In particular, but not limited to:
Am I misrepresenting what I do? (Fair Trading Act)
Am I building with a consent when it’s needed? (Building Act)
Am I supplying all the paperwork necessary as part of a construction project? (Building Act)
Am I building within my licence class? (Building Act)
Am I meeting my resource consent conditions? (Resource Management Act)
Am I taking all practicable steps to ensure the safety of myself and others? (Health and Safety in Employment Act)
If you’ve set up a company, you need to be aware of your obligations as a company director under the Companies Act 1993. You can be held personally liable in a number of circumstances, including trading while insolvent. This can also include other non-acting directors, such as wives and partners. Consider:
Is my company financially solvent and, if not, am I still taking on new business (eg new jobs, buying materials)?
Am I meeting my health and safety responsibilities?
You can read more about this in our article “Directors of companies can be held personally liable” at www.builtin.co.nz/buildersinsurance .
The next article will focus specifically on risks that may affect your business’ financial situation, such as getting paid and dealing with bad debt.

While eliminating all risks to your business might be impossible, you can plan for them and minimise their impact. Construction insurance expert Ben Rickard explains how
Imagine a world where you could run your business without worrying about anything unexpected coming along to knock you off track. No economic downturns, no new government regulations, no natural disasters, no accidents on site, no nightmare customers, no staffing issues, no defective products, no unpaid bills, no stolen tools. Then all you have is upside, your profits can be locked in and your stress levels evaporate. That really is the holy grail for anyone in business!
OK, so eliminating all risks might be impossible, but what you can do is plan for them, so that when they do happen, you can minimise their impact.
It is also important to differentiate between positive risks (the ones you take to grow your business, such as expanding into a new area or taking on more staff) versus negative risks (threats).
There are three primary steps to eliminating downside risks.
Step 1: Risk identification
First, you need to know all the risks that you face. Without a meaningful categorisation, this can be difficult. Categories of risk may include:
Natural Risk
Security Risk
Technology Risk
Workspace Risk
Supply Chain Risk
Environmental Risk
Product Liability Risk
Financial Risk
Economic Risk
Human Risk
Governance and Legal Risk
Reputational Risk
Business Risk
Within each category are individual hazards. It usually takes an experienced risk professional to help company directors and business owners complete this process, but there are inexpensive software tools that can make it much easier.
Step 2: Risk analysis & quantification
Once you have identified the risks, each one needs to have a price attached to it. That is, what is the cost to your business if that particular event was to happen ? What would it cost if a bad customer kicked off ? Or a disgruntled employee ? Or there was a cyber attack, or an economic downturn ? Or a serious accident involving key people in the company ? Identifying the likelihood (how often) and severity (how costly) of each risk allows us to make the cost calculation.
Once you know the cost of each risk we move on to the next step.
Step 3: Risk treatment
This is where we work out the most cost-effective way to deal with each risk. That is, what is the cheapest solution we can implement to get the biggest reduction in risk ? There are four options:
Ignore it (do nothing).
Avoid it (don’t do the thing that is creating the risk).
Reduce it (implement an approach that minimises the cost or likelihood of the event happening).
Transfer it (pay an insurer to take on the risk instead).
Various treatment options may include:
Additional training for staff, such as driver safety, customer relationship management, contract management, technical skills.
Incentive programmes for staff, such as for safety, customer feedback, sales targets, defect complaints.
Investment in security systems, fencing, cameras, fire prevention measures, lock boxes for tools and equipment.
Written policies.
Systems and processes.
Professional advice.
Reviewing contractual terms and conditions.
Insurance.
The theory here is simple and the effect can be transformative (both for the business and personally) for those that do it well. But it will generally only happen with high-level engagement by the business principals, the support of a professional risk manager, and the right tools.
In summary
Eliminating risk might be impossible, but planning for a crisis and minimising the cost of risk is one of the most important responsibilities for any business owner. Yet many are not adequately doing so, or doing so in a haphazard way that can lead to gaps. With the right advice and following three simple steps, many of these threats can be eliminated, or the cost of them substantially reduced.

A lot of insurance is tied to contracts, so it’s critical you understand what’s in your contract and comply with the requirements within them
Even if you use a standard contract, things might change and you need to be on top of this, or you might end up in hot water.
Guarantees and bonds Contracts from the building trade associations typically include a reference to that association’s ten-year guarantee. Third-party guarantees of that nature, including Builtin’s independent one, gives homeowners an additional layer of protection if there is a problem and their builder is unable or unwilling to resolve it (usually because they have gone bust). It’s important not to confuse a requirement for one of these with your implied warranties under the Building Act, which requires you to guarantee your own work anyway.
The third-party guarantees described above are designed to ‘back up’ your own warranty, in case you are not around to meet it yourself. However, these guarantees are not insurance to
cover your own mistakes – you are still responsible and these guarantees will only step in if you aren’t able to meet your obligations yourself.
If your contract says you will provide a third-party guarantee, then it becomes a legal obligation on you. There have been numerous stories in the media over the years (and plenty more that don’t make it to the news) where a homeowner was promised a 10-year guarantee but their builder never applied for it.
These guarantees come in two parts:
The guarantee of completion.
The defects cover.
You must make sure that, if your clients require completion cover, then the guarantee you provide includes this, otherwise you may be in breach of contract. This is generally the most important part, as it guarantees that their job will be completed at the price agreed. It is the completion cover that banks are generally interested in when they require these guarantees as a condition of lending.
If it’s a commercial contract, then it may include a requirement to provide a performance bond. These are common in large contracts but increasingly demanded for medium-sized jobs as well. Banks, insurance companies and specialist bond sureties can provide these, though the insurance and surety-backed ones often work out more cost effective than having all that capital tied up at your bank.
If your contract requires retentions, it may also allow you to provide a bond instead, called a ‘bond in lieu of retentions’. This can be a safer way to meet your defects liability obligations, as you have no outstanding cash sitting with your principal – the bond simply expires once the defects period ends.
When arranging a bond, it is important it meets the conditions of the contract. Most contracts will include the specific form of the bond wording required, and the insurer or bond surety will usually defer to this.
Contracts may also reference a ‘principal’s bond’. If the contractor wants to guarantee they will be paid for work done, they can demand the principal provide a bond to this effect.
Contract works insurance Who arranges the contract works insurance (also sometimes called builder’s risk) is usually specified in the contract. If it says the builder is responsible for it, then it is up to you to arrange it. Standard practice is that builders will be required to arrange contract works cover when the job is a full contract new build. For jobs like alterations and renovations, which involve work to an existing structure (where there is already an insurer for that building), the building owner is usually responsible, in the contract, for arranging this insurance. The same goes if the job is labour only.
If the owner is responsible, we strongly recommend that you see a copy of the policy before you start work (to make sure it has been correctly arranged). It could cause you an issue if they haven’t arranged it, even though it was not your responsibility, as you are considered a ‘joint insured’ under the policy. Without a policy in place, you could be held liable for any damage you are responsible for. This includes ensuring there is cover for damage to the existing structure caused by the performance of the building work.
Another important consideration is the ‘additional items’ that are often specified. These include allowances for things like professional fees, demolition and removal of debris and escalation in costs. If the contract specifies amounts for these, then you must make sure the contract works insurance matches them.
Public liability insurance Make sure if the contract says you will hold $5m cover (or any other amount) that your public liability insurance is sufficient for that amount. Policy limits can be increased for specific contracts if required.
Note that public liability policies automatically cover your principal for their ‘vicarious liability’. This means liability they have for your actions (eg, if a neighbour held them responsible for damage to their property resulting from your building activity). If a principal (or their lawyer) asks for their name to be added to your public liability policy, that usually means they don’t understand how liability insurance works. Insurers generally won’t add principals to contractors’ public liability policies because they already include that vicarious liability clause.
Professional indemnity insurance Contracts may also require the contractor to hold professional indemnity insurance. This is common if the job involves an element of design on the part of the contractor, such as with ‘design and build’ projects. There are also many situations where the builder is required to engage the services of other professionals as subcontractors (like surveyors or engineers), where there is a professional indemnity exposure to the contractor if that professional stuffs up.
If the contract requires you to have this, take note of the conditions and ensure these are met by your professional indemnity insurance. Professional indemnity policies are of a type called ‘claims made’.
This means that as well as having the cover when you did the job, the policy has to be in place continuously up until the time the claim is made against you, which could be many years after the project is completed. The contract will probably require you to hold it for a minimum period after completion of the project. Some contracts refer to six years, but we would recommend at least ten years from when a Code Compliance Certificate is achieved.
Contractor’s plant These conditions typically refer to ‘critical pieces’ or items over a specific value. It is designed to ensure that a project isn’t delayed because an important piece of equipment is damaged and not insured (and the contractor can’t afford to replace it).It doesn’t mean you need to have tools insurance for your small items (although you should!).
Motor vehicle third party liability This is required in contracts because, if a vehicle causes damage to the works (or nearby property), it is the vehicle’s insurance policy that needs to pay (licensed, registered vehicles aren’t covered by public liability insurance).
The contractor must make sure all vehicles they are responsible for (including workers and subbies) are insured. Limits are often specified and most commercial vehicle policies will have at least $2m and commonly $10m, but you need to make sure yours meets the contract requirements.
As a side note, in general terms, if a piece of equipment that is road registered is being used for its specialised purpose (eg, a crane or pump truck) then damage it does at that time would be covered by public liability insurance. If it is being driven, then it would be covered by the vehicle third party insurance.
In a nutshell
If you’ve got through this article, then you can get through a contract! It might seem like a drag and a waste of time and be hard to decipher (I’m talking about contracts, hopefully not this article) but it is absolutely critical if something goes wrong that you have properly complied with the contract terms. A good insurance broker will assist you to meet your insurance (and guarantee and bond) obligations within your contract and can complete any contract schedules necessary or supply certificates.

Mind the gap! – between practical completion of a build and getting a consent completion certificate (CCC)
Homeowners or builders – if they are contracted to do so – should prioritise getting a CCC. Delays can affect the owner’s ability to arrange house insurance and, if something happens to the house in the period between practical completion and a CCC being issued, builders can be liable.
A contract works policy will generally expire on the EARLIER of:
the policy end date; or
practical completion; or
when the owners start using the building; or
if it’s a spec, when 95% of the budget is spent.
Some house insurers will only insure a property that has a CCC. As there is often a delay between the time the property is practically complete and the date a CCC is issued (for example, if the owner needs to complete landscaping) houses can be left uninsured for a period of time.
It is important to make clients aware they must arrange house insurance from the point of practical completion.
Builders should always arrange contract works insurance before starting any build work. Banks could withhold finance needed to complete a project if insurance is not in place.
Because the cost of a claim towards the end of a project is higher than the cost at the start, insurers are reluctant to provide cover after work has started. The value of what’s on site increases over time and insurers don’t like being asked to only insure the riskiest period of the build.
Insurers will require lots of extra information before agreeing to provide cover and the cost may be higher than if it was arranged before the build started. In some cases, they may even decline to provide cover, which can complicate finance arrangements.
SOLUTION : Arrange contract works insurance BEFORE you start building!

Liability and indemnity insurance can be a tricky issue to deal with, so it’s important you’re aware of some of the potential risks and grey areas
With a large customer base operating in the construction trades, we deal with a lot of liability claims. There are some issues that, while not common, could trip you up if you are not aware of them.
The right occupation
Liability and professional indemnity policies cover the insured person for the occupation and/or activities shown on the policy. For example, if your occupation is shown as a plumber, but you also do some roofing work, then a claim related to roofing may not be covered as you are only insured for the activities of a plumber. Make sure when you take out cover, or renew it, that your policy accurately reflects what you do.
Delayed notification
While we appreciate that it is often tempting to try to resolve an issue before bringing it to your insurer’s attention, this can jeopardise your cover if you need to make a claim later. Your insurance contract obliges you to notify the insurer of a potential claim, and they have the right to become involved.
For example, if you negotiated with a customer and made an offer, or rejected one from them, you may find that your insurer restricts what you can get as part of a claim to those previously made or rejected terms. Usually the insurer will only have cause to do this if your early admission of liability or offer of settlement has prejudiced their handling or settlement of the claim.
Prior legal costs
Similarly, if you have engaged a lawyer and incurred costs before getting your insurer involved you may find that they won’t cover those fees.
Claims or circumstances at renewal
When you renew your policy, you must tell the insurer if you are aware of any potential claims or circumstances that could give rise to a claim. Failure to do so at renewal may result in a future claim being declined or cover limited.
In a nutshell
Liability and indemnity cover can be incredibly complicated, and claims can be costly. Getting the right advice and support is key to achieving the right outcome. Not every event is covered, but a better understanding of how the policies work will reduce frustration and misunderstanding of what you are and aren’t insured for.

TITLE   : ACC considerations for builders

Builtin speaks with thousands of LBPs up and down the country each year. One message that comes through consistently is that builders think ACC will cover their costs should they be forced to take time off work. However, that’s not always true
If you’re a self-employed builder, staying healthy is important. Getting sick or injured can have a big impact on your ability to keep the money rolling in.
It’s estimated that 80% of builders have not optimised their ACC cover or put in place adequate protection in case of illness, yet this is one of the most common risks to your ability to bring in an income.
Out of every 1,000 builders off work through disability, 900 will be laid up due to illness – not accident. Yet ACC only provides compensation for accidental injury, not illness.
A common attitude among builders is that it won’t happen to them, and many are lucky. However, take a moment to consider what the impact would be on your family if you were forced to take extended time off work, while receiving little or no compensation – it’s just not worth the risk.
What’s the solution?
The recommended option for self-employed builders is to switch from the default ACC plan to something called Cover Plus Extra. There are a number of benefits to doing this:
ACC levies for admin staff
If you’re on the default plan, all staff , even those only doing admin, will be rated at your business’ ACC classification. With Cover Plus Extra, you can pay a cheaper rate for office-only staff, which could save you thousands.
Speed and certainty if a claim is necessary
On the default plan, your compensation is capped at 80% of your actual income, which is determined by ACC at the time of the claim. This process can take some time, as they’ll have to go through your books and, while this is happening, you’ll get no compensation.
If you’ve had a slow patch in the past 12 months, or your accountant has split your income with your partner for tax purposes, you may find that your ACC payout is well below what you expect and need. With Cover Plus Extra, you agree to a fi xed income with ACC and get 100% of that fi gure if you have to make a claim.
Dialling down your ACC levy and broadening your cover by going private
Cover Plus Extra also allows you to dial down your ACC levy contributions to a minimum level. Savings can then be used to buy income protection insurance, which gives cover for accidents, sicknesses and illnesses. This substantially broadens your cover to include the events that are most likely to keep you off work.
Dangerous Dave – an ACC case study
Consider Dave, a 40-year-old builder earning $80k. His ACC levy works out at around $67 per week for injury-only cover.
By reducing his ACC cover to the minimum allowable under Cover Plus Extra and taking out private loss of earnings insurance, he ends up paying $66 per week for cover that includes both injury and illness.
This is based on a five-year benefit period vs cover under ACC that could run until retirement. However, as 91% of claimants are back to work within the first five years, this makes sense.
Alternatively, for cover that runs until age 65, the cost would be an extra $20 per week. There are also other considerations that may affect whether this arrangement is right for you, such as your age and any pre-existing conditions.
I’m an employee, can this help me?
While employees don’t pay their own ACC levies, you can still benefit from income protection insurance if you’re forced off the job through illness, which is not covered by ACC. Even those with insurance often face long stand-down periods before receiving any payout. For builders, a plan that includes specific injury benefits can offer the best cover.
What are specific injury benefits?
Income protection policies all have a stand-down period, which for many injuries can be longer than the time you’re off work. This means you may get nothing despite being unable to work for many weeks.
With specific injury benefit cover, you’ll immediately receive a payout in the event of certain injuries, regardless of the stand-down period in your policy.
This pays out the benefit regardless of whether or not the injury keeps you away from work. That means you could fracture your wrist, return to work the following week and still receive a month’s worth of benefit.
What should I do?
If you haven’t done this yet, or want to review the cover you have, get in touch with your fi nancial adviser, or contact Builtin. They’ll arrange for you to have a chat with an adviser, who is also a former builder, and put some options on the table. You can request a review builtininsurance.co.nz/incomeprotection.

TITLE   : Insurance cover exclusions
CATEGORY: insurance
DATE    :

Deciding what insurance cover exclusions are relevant to include in the Prescribed Disclosure Information before building can be a convoluted task – Builtin offers some advice on how to proceed
A ccording to the amendments to the Building Act introduced in 2015 – which further strengthened its consumer protection measures – builders must include all “relevant exclusions” when summarising their insurance cover in a disclosure statement.
Which ones are relevant and who decides this is not clearly defined. Can a builder be expected to decide this ? Are they all relevant? Or is it only the one that results in a claim being declined that’s relevant ?
What if you get it wrong ? Your safest bet, and one taken by many builders, may be to include a full copy of your insurance policies with every disclosure statement, although that seems to defeat the purpose of introducing a disclosure statement to help consumers make better decisions.
MBIE’s disclosure statement template refers to three insurance policy examples: contract works; public liability and professional indemnity (also called errors and omissions indemnity).
It also talks about the guarantees and warranties that the builder offers.
Aside from product warranties and those guarantees given by subcontractors, many builders offer a ten-year guarantee of their obligations to the customer that is backed by an insurer or other third party.
This article highlights each of these policies, explaining what they cover and outlining some common exclusions and limitations, using Builtin’s policies as an example.
It should be noted that policies vary by insurer, and you should review your own or speak to your insurance adviser if you’re unsure.
Type of policy: Public liability Protecting the builder from liability for the cost of accidental damage to, or loss of, another person’s property.
Amount of cover Enter the limit of indemnity of your policy (eg, $1m, $2m, $5m or $10m). The policy will also contain a number of extensions with their own sub-limits too.
Relevant exclusions (examples): Faulty design and materials, faulty workmanship (although this can be included as an extension), damage to the property you’re working on, your own products, damage caused by a vehicle and damage arising from your professional advice. Full details are contained within the policy wording, which is available upon request.
Type of policy: Contract works Protecting the project from hazards such as theft, vandalism, accidental damage, storm, flood, fire and natural disaster.
Amount of cover Enter the sum insured for the project. This should take into account the full rebuild cost, including any materials and subcontractors supplied by the owner. There are also a number of automatic extensions, such as for professional fees and cost inflation, with their own limits.
Relevant exclusions (examples): Damage to existing structures (unless included separately), consequential loss, contractor’s tools and equipment (unless included as an option), full or partial occupation before practical completion, defective workmanship and design. Full details are contained within the policy wording, which is available upon request.
Type of policy: Professional indemnity (errors & omissions indemnity) Protecting the builder from liability for causing a loss to the third party which is not related to physical property damage – eg, failing to correctly follow a specification, unauthorised product substitution, poor subcontractor work, incorrect site layout.
Amount of cover Enter the limit of indemnity of your policy (eg, $250,000, $500,000 or $1m). The policy may contain a number of extensions that may have their own sub-limits too.
Relevant exclusions (examples): Property damage and injury, financial estimates, building surveys and inspections, faulty materials, financial failure. Full details are contained within the policy wording, which is available upon request.
Nature or type of guarantee: Ten-year Homefirst Builders Guarantee Giving peace of mind to owners that if their builder can’t complete the work the insurer will arrange for another builder to complete the build, absorb any extra costs and guarantee to fix future defects.
Period of cover Completion cover ends on practical completion of the project. Defects cover lasts for ten years, expiring on the date shown on the guarantee certificate.
Limits on cover Loss of deposit and non-completion – 20% of the contract price to a maximum of $500,000. Defects – $1,000,000.
Exclusions on cover (examples) Contractual disputes, consequential loss to property that is not part of the works or is insured elsewhere, significant variations, landscaping, driveways and septic tanks, defects that are within acceptable tolerances, wear and tear and aesthetic variances. Full details are contained within the policy wording, which is available upon request.
One example that isn’t listed on MBIE’s disclosure template is the liability cover included with your motor vehicle insurance. This covers damage caused to your customer’s property by the vehicle, such as clipping a fence or reversing into a wall.
There are other policies builders are advised to have that are not relevant to your customers, so don’t need to be disclosed, but are important to managing your own risk. Examples include illness insurance, tools cover and protection from bad debt.
As mentioned at the start of this article, individual policy wordings from different insurers will vary. You should refer to the specific exclusions in your own policy wordings and discuss your situation with an insurance professional if you are unsure.

Watch out for limits to liability in the Terms of Trade of your subcontractors and consultants
When explaining the liability that builders have for mistakes made by their subbies or consultants, we often hear the response: “but their insurance should cover that, right?” It is wishful thinking in the extreme to assume that someone else’s insurance is going to protect you, even if you’re only liable because of their mistake.
Who is responsible?
In most cases, a main contractor has a primary duty of care to their client for the actions of their subcontractors. In others, the main contractor is ‘vicariously liable’. Vicarious liability is the imposition of liability on one person  for the negligence of another. For example, a homeowner could be vicariously liable to the local water company if the drainlayer they engaged damaged an underground pipe.
This basically means that, if you take a contract to deliver a service (eg, build a house) and you choose to subcontract out parts of that contract, you are still ultimately liable to your client for the actions of the subcontractors  you use.
Limited liability
Problems arise for the main contractor where they are unable to recover the cost of a mistake from the subbie or consultant that was responsible. This could be because the subbie has gone bust, or because their Terms of Trade, which you accepted when you took them on, have limited their liability in the event of a mistake. This is very common and can severely limit the ability of a main contractor to recover their costs that were due to a  subbie’s mistake. You’re caught in the middle – liable to your client but unable to recover from your subbie.
Some examples of limited Terms of Trade include:
“In any event our liability for the services supplied is limited to two times the cost of the fee paid for such service.”
“We shall be under no liability whatsoever to the Client for any indirect and/or consequential loss and/or expense (including loss of profit) suffered by the Client arising out of a breach by Us of these terms and conditions (alternatively Our liability shall be limited to damages which under no circumstances shall exceed the Price of the Goods).”
This sounds great, and for the subbie or consultant it is. Unfortunately, if you’re a builder doing residential building work, the Building Act says you can’t contract out of your duty of care to residential homeowners. Read some examples below:
1. Foundation laid too close to boundary
A builder in Wellington subcontracted foundation work to another firm, which laid the slab in the wrong place on the property, meaning it was too close to the boundary.
This was not picked up until after the final inspection and the builder was held liable for the cost of rectifying the problem – a total of $40,000. The foundations subcontractor had gone bust, so the builder had to wear the full  cost.
2. Site marked out incorrectly
An Auckland builder engaged a surveyor to identify and mark out the boundary of a property before starting work. Again, building work was substantially under way before it was discovered that the surveyor had marked the  site incorrectly. The builder was liable for $50,000 but, because the surveyor’s terms of trade limited their liability to two times their fee, the builder had to wear close to $40,000 of this cost.
3. Repair to a tractor
This claim involved a tractor where a bearing sold by the insured party damaged the tractor’s engine, costing $15,000 to repair. The insured’s Terms of Trade limited their liability to the value of the goods supplied ($150 for the bearing). Their insurer was happy to rely on these terms of trade, so were not liable to pay out any more than $150.
Read your subbies’ and consultants’ terms of trade
Be aware of what you’re agreeing to when you take on their services. They may be able to contract out of their liability, but if you’re doing residential building work then it’s unlikely that you can, which means you’ll be caught in the middle if they make a mistake. That’s why you need your own liability and professional indemnity insurance.
In a nutshell
If you’re doing residential building work, the Building Act says you can’t contract out of your duty of care to your customer. You’re liable for the actions of the subbies and consultants you engage. So, if they’ve gone bust or have limited their liability in their terms of trade, you can’t rely on recovering your costs from them if they make a mistake. This is why you need your own insurance.

Increasingly expensive vehicle repairs, government levies, theft and extreme weather are all contributing to rising insurance costs
Builders and other tradespeople could soon be paying more for their insurance due to a confluence of factors. Builtin’s Ben Rickard said that premiums are going up “right across the board because of higher costs, increases in compulsory government levies and increased worldwide claims because of natural disasters”.
In particular, vehicle and building repair costs are becoming more expensive, increasing the cost of cover in those areas.
Following an increase to the Fire & Emergency Levy that came into effect at the start of July, the government recently announced it is increasing the EQC levy to 20 cents per $100 of cover for residential property and contents insurance from the start of November.
The levy is capped at the first $100,000 of cover for homes and $20,000 of cover for contents. The extra revenue will be used to replenish the New Zealand Natural Disaster Fund. For most homeowners with house and contents cover, this will increase their insurance premiums by $69 per year. Rickard said he expects the effect on builders from this increase to be minimal.
“While they’ll see an increase in their own house and contents insurance, it’s not charged on contract works insurance in most situations.”
While he said it was impossible to put a figure on how much a builder or tradesperson’s own business insurance costs could increase, Rickard expects it may be higher in some cases than in others, particularly when it comes to vehicle and tools insurance.
He also added that he wasn’t aware of any evidence that homeowners forced to pay higher insurance would be likely to reduce their spending on home maintenance and renovations.
Lock it up
A higher occurrence of tool theft is another factor that could see builders and tradespeople pay more.
“The amount of theft has skyrocketed and that means losses on tool insurance policies are also going up, so premiums will go up to reflect that.
“Just this week a client of ours in Queenstown had $30,000 worth of tools stolen. In towns like that and in rural places they don’t expect it to happen like it does in the big cities, but tool theft is a business for some thieves and they’ll go where the pickings are easy,” said Rickard, adding that there were several things builders could do to combat thieves.
“Educating the industry is a big part of what we do. The police often run drives in conjunction with merchants to have people engrave their tools with an LBP number, phone number or other unique identifier, which helps to discourage theft and aid recovery.
“If tools are locked in a container, tool trailer or a vehicle, use a good heavy lock, wheel clamp and park off the street. It’s also important that builders are aware of their surroundings and keep an eye on who might be poking around, because unfortunately a lot of theft is associated with people visiting or working on a job, either directly or indirectly.”
An up-to-date asset register that includes serial numbers, purchase price, photos and when and where their tools were purchased can help to ensure a swift claim turnaround.
“Technology is also getting to the point where people can use GPS or RFID tags to track expensive equipment and receive alerts to their phone if something’s taken,” said Rickard. “It’s becoming more affordable and is something we’re investigating to see if it’s feasible for us to provide that service or offer discounted rates where they’re used.”
Every cloud…
Rickard said that rising premiums often provide an opportunity for people to shop around to ensure they’re getting the best deal.
“There’s a lot of competition in the insurance industry, so an increase can give people the opportunity to take stock and look for a better deal, in terms of both price and cover. If they look around, they might find they make some savings.
“However, there can also be a downside to switching insurer, particularly if you’ve been with them for a long time. There could be a lot of goodwill and beneficial terms the customer might lose if they went elsewhere.”

Last month, we provided a framework to help you evaluate the various risks facing your business, their likelihood and potential cost. In our second article in the series, we focus on property risk
Construction is a risky business, more so than most, yet many builders don’t spend enough time really understanding their risk environment and putting in place strategies to manage, avoid or transfer that risk.
Property
Liability
Financial
Personal/Family
One of the easiest areas to assess and understand is property, which can also be described as your business’ physical assets. It’s important you understand how damage to your tools, equipment, vehicles and office could affect your business and what your insurance policies cover you for.
In construction, there are five basic types of property that pose a risk to your business. Use the following suggestions to help create a property risk management strategy.
Who drives them – could the young apprentice be asked to pop down to the dairy or pick up materials?
Do you store tools and equipment in them?
Where are they parked up at night?
Are they alarmed or disabled?
Do your workers know the ‘rules’ when driving company vehicles?
Have you verified workers’ licenses and driving history?
Have you considered comprehensive vs third party, fire & theft or third party only cover?
Is your vehicle actually insured under a private policy (in which case, a claim may be declined)?
Have you insured your trailers (they are considered vehicles, not equipment)?
Do you have an asset register and pictures of your most expensive tools?
Have you kept receipts/invoices for them?
Have electrical items been tested?
What is their total value and is this their market (old) or replacement (new) value?
How are they secured when on and off site?
If they are stored in vehicles, how secure are they?
If they were stolen, how would it affect your ability to work?
Do you know what your excess is for various types of loss (eg. theft vs damage)?
Have you insured the full value of the construction project, including materials, labour and the increase in costs over the life of the project?
Have you included the value of materials supplied by the owner, including any sub-contractor they employ and will pay directly?
Have you insured for the additional costs involved if there is damage, including demolition, professional fees and increased costs during re-construction?
Does the period of insurance allow for delays to the completion date?
Have you advised the insurer if there are variations that increase the project cost?
“Is your insurer aware of the full range of work being done from the premises: ie, are you doing any manufacturing, hot work or storing hazardous materials?
Have you ensured that the owner has actually arranged cover and you are named on the policy?
Have they contacted their house insurer to notify them that construction work is taking place?
Are you covered if the existing structure is damaged during the building work?
We have previously highlighted some of the issues with construction (contract works) insurance. You can read and watch more at: www.builtin.co.nz/contractworks
If you work from home, is your work space correctly insured with your house and contents insurer? Have they agreed to cover your business assets under your domestic contents policy and if so, is the cover enough?
Have you had a valuation and is it up to date?
Is your insurer aware of the full range of work being done from the premises: ie, are you doing any manufacturing, hot work or storing hazardous materials?
Have you reviewed your security measures (eg fencing, locks, alarms, cameras)?
No doubt there are other assets that you own privately or through a trust and the principles are the same.
Insuring physical assets is the most common form of insurance, but their loss is not necessarily the most risky event (in terms of likelihood and cost) a building business will face.
The next article will focus specifically on liability, which means the risk of being held responsible for injury to another person, loss or damage to their property, or financial loss they suffer as a result of actions, mistakes or omissions you are responsible for.

TITLE   : Public liability insurance

Many tradies worry more about liability than a car accident or theft, yet they are less likely to have adequate insurance to cover it. This can be problematic, as in many cases the actual costs of a liability claim can be greater!
Public liability insurance is one of the most important policies that a trade professional should have. It is intended to protect you from the cost of accidentally damaging other people’s property and – in some cases – causing them injury.
This article looks at some of the most important definitions and exclusions in a public liability policy.
Policy definitions
Damage/property damage
To be a claim, generally there must first be accidental damage to property. This can also include the loss of property that isn’t actually damaged, and the loss of use of property.
Event/occurrence
To meet the criteria for this type of claim, the accidental damage must result from a single event and occur within the policy period. The event must be unforeseen and unintended from the standpoint of the policy holder.
Faulty/defective workmanship
Unfortunately, there is no accepted insurance definition of faulty workmanship, which is why it can be such a contentious issue. Was damage caused accidentally or by poor workmanship?
Your view might be quite different from that of your insurance company. If your policy does not include cover for faulty workmanship, you could find your claim is declined.
Consequential loss/resultant damage
The policy can also cover the indirect costs of damage you cause. For example, the cost of lost sales due to a power failure if you cut through a power cable, or the subsequent water damage to walls and carpets caused by a leaky pipe.
Insured’s products
Your own products are not covered by the policy. This can include anything you have constructed once it is no longer in your possession or control. It’s important you have a policy that is tailored for builders, otherwise damage to a house you’ve worked in could be excluded from your liability cover.
Policy exclusions
Asbestos
Asbestos-related legal action is amongst the longest and most expensive in history. Insurers are unwilling to take on the cost of this risk and have excluded any loss related to asbestos. Asbestos exposure could be an increased risk in Christchurch reconstruction work.
Vehicles, boats and aircraft
Claims for damage from owning, working on or using vehicles, watercraft (although smaller ones may still be covered) and aircraft (including products incorporated into aircraft) are not covered.
Damage caused by your car, van, ute and trailers is excluded – these should be covered by a separate commercial vehicle insurance policy.
Pollution
The cost of pollution, including air, water and ground pollution, and the associated clean-up costs are excluded from most policies. However, some will still cover a specific event if it is sudden and unintended.
Employee injury
Injury to an employee that arises out of their work for you is excluded. The ACC scheme is intended to cover this.
Building defects, mould, rot, gradual deterioration and water penetration
As a result of the leaky homes crisis, many policies from general insurers now exclude cover for the effects of water penetrating a building envelope. As the multi-billion dollar cost of the crisis became clear, insurers decided that the cost of future leaky building claims was too high for them to bear and amended policies to exclude it.
Separate policies that protect tradies from liability for financial loss, such as Builtin’s E&O Indemnity, are available. Leaks from internal pipes and water systems are still generally covered by public liability insurance.
Errors in professional advice
You are generally not covered for damage that results from poor professional advice if you’ve charged for it.
As an expert, your clients are entitled to rely on what you say and, if you get it wrong, they can hold you liable for the cost of this mistake.
If the advice was given for free, then you may still be covered under the standard policy wording.
Defective design
Costs arising from a defective design or specification are excluded from public liability cover. You should be wary of doing any design, unless you have separate professional indemnity insurance that specifically covers this.
Your products, materials and the property you’re working on
Public liability insurance is intended to cover the cost of damage to other people’s property. This means products that you own, supply, install or construct are excluded under most policies. This becomes tricky for trade professionals, because of the way insurers define ‘your products’.
Along with the obvious, some definitions may also include any property that you have been, or are, working on. When it comes to claims from builders, the house you’re working on has often been interpreted as ‘your product’, and therefore is not covered because of this exclusion.
However, some policies make it clear that buildings, or separate components of a property, will still be covered. The definition of ‘your products’ is one of the most important aspects of your policy, and we strongly recommend you clarify this with your insurer and switch to a policy with a more trade-friendly definition if necessary.
Defective/faulty workmanship
Some polices won’t cover the cost of fixing any workmanship that causes damage. Others exclude cover for faulty workmanship only if it results in water penetration of the building envelope.
However, damage that occurs as a result of faulty workmanship may still be covered. Some policies now allow you to add cover for your liability for faulty workmanship.
The issue of faulty workmanship is one of the trickiest areas of liability for trade professionals. You should make sure that your policy covers this.
Loss of use
The policy may not cover you if a client can’t get into their house (or use any other property) because of a delay or product failure that you’re responsible for. They may hold you liable for extra rental, hotel and travel costs, but these can’t be claimed on your policy.
Property in your care, custody or control
Any claim related to any property that is in your physical care or that you have hired is excluded.
Some exclusions, such as the last three above, can be added back in as extensions to your policy, so it’s important that you check what your own policy does and doesn’t cover.
PLEASE NOTE: This article clarifies some of the common definitions and exclusions contained within most public/general liability policies available from major insurers in New Zealand. The specific wording from different insurers will vary and you should seek the advice of an insurance professional if necessary. Insurers will interpret and apply their own policy wording depending on the specific circumstances of each individual claim, and they’re all different. This article is a guide only and should not be relied upon as legal advice.

Weather events, inflation and supply constraints (among others) have increased the cost of reinsurance across New Zealand. If your premiums look likely to go up, these tips from BuiltIn’s in-house expert Ben Rickard could save you money
T he year 2023 has already seen the largest volume of weather- related insurance claims in New Zealand’s history, with claim losses exceeding 2022 – which itself was a record year. The increasing number and severity of weather events is one reason that insurance costs are rising. Other factors include inflation and supply chain constraints. Reinstatement work is taking longer and costing more. These factors are contributing to significant increases in the cost of reinsurance for New Zealand insurers, which will have to be passed on to customers.
An increase in the Earthquake Commission levy, taking the minimum on a residential house from $300 to $480 per year, is also continuing to flow through to customers’ overall policy costs.
While car windscreen cover remains free (no excess) from almost all insurers, the increasing sophistication of embedded sensors and other technology make replacing them more and more expensive. Longer lead times and greater costs for parts coming to New Zealand are also affecting repair costs. The market value of vehicles is also increasing as prices in the second-hand car market get a boost following the recent floods.
The theft of trade tools has been a constant driver of losses on the tools insurance portfolio and there is no sign of this decreasing over the next few years.
Are you under insured?
As inflation increases, replacement costs rise and sum insured values need to increase accordingly to ensure that your assets are adequately insured. It may be worth re-evaluating these more frequently than just once a year at renewal time. It is not advisable to underinsure your assets to reduce premium costs, as this could backfire big time in the event of a large or total loss.
Negotiating rate increases
Our job is to get our clients the best possible cover for the best possible price. Where increases are required, we will work to keep these to a minimum and seek additional coverage benefits to offset them, as we prefer not to water down policy coverage in return for lower rates. As a member of the Steadfast Group, we benefit from the negotiating power of Australasia’s largest network of insurance brokers, with 53 brokers nationwide and over $11.5bn of annual premium spend to negotiate with.
Affordability
If you are experiencing cashflow issues, or want to manage your cashflow prudently in 2023, you may want to consider paying your insurance in monthly instalments rather than all at once. While this incurs an additional cost in the form of interest charged by the premium funding provider, it spreads the cost and can take the squeeze out of the renewal month. We are seeing a significant rise in this option being taken by customers.
We can also look to move policy renewal dates around, to spread them throughout the year rather than all being lumped into one period.
Vehicles
Expected increase:
It would not be unexpected to see rises of 10-20% on vehicle insurance premiums in 2023, across both private and commercial vehicles. This is in addition to any rise from increasing sums insured.
Loss reduction:
Consider installing security features such as an alarm or immobiliser. A steering wheel lock will deter potential thieves.
Ensure vehicles are locked at all times and garaged overnight where possible.
Install a GPS/GSM tracker, such as www.black-int.com.
Install towball locks and/or wheel clamps on trailers.
Avoid distracted driving: don’t use your phone or other devices while driving.
Keep a safe distance from the vehicle in front of you, especially in bad weather.
Avoid aggressive driving: don’t tailgate, cut off other drivers or go too fast.
Always be aware of your surroundings, use your mirrors.
Premium reduction:
Request a named drivers-only discount.
Downgrade to third party or third party, fire & theft cover.
Liability
Expected increase:
There is likely to be a relatively modest, inflation-adjusted increase in liability premiums. However, insurers are also becoming more targeted in how they rate the risk from different occupations. This means that some trades may experience a larger increase than others, as the claim losses coming from their profession are higher than other trades.
Loss reduction:
Visit our resource library/blog for claim examples and tips for how to reduce claims across various trades: builtininsurance.co.nz/articles .
Premium reduction:
Reduce cover amounts (with caution).
Make sure the estimated turnover (and number of staff) your premium is based upon is as accurate as possible.
Look for deals available from trade associations or merchant loyalty programmes (eg, Placemakers Plus).
Tools and equipment
Expected increase:
An increase is likely, due to both inflation and the continued frequency and cost of claims. This could be in the region of 10-15%.
Loss reduction:
Do not leave tools in vehicles overnight when they are parked in the open (eg, roadside or driveway).
Lock your vehicle at all times.
Install heavy security storage boxes, such as: www.armorgard.co.nz/cat/equipment-and-tool-storage.
Install GPS/GSM tracking chips, such as: www.black-int.com.
Mark all your tools with a clearly identifiable brand/colour.
Engrave your tools with your contact details (eg, mobile number).
Keep a register of all your tools, including serial numbers, in case of recovery by the Police.
Premium reduction:
Install Armorgard lock boxes for a lower excess in the event of a claim (Builtin only).
Look for deals available from trade associations or merchant loyalty programmes (eg, PlaceMakers Plus).
Contract works, property and buildings
Expected increase:
One insurer has flagged an average increase on house insurance of 32% and on contents cover of 26%. However, there will be a wide range of individual variations due to localised risk factors such as flood, earthquake, landslip and coastal inundation.
We expect to see a higher-than-inflation increase in contract works insurance premiums, perhaps in the region of 10-15%. This is due to the general market conditions outlined above, including construction cost inflation and reinsurance costs.
Loss reduction:
Minimise delays during construction by scheduling the job in detail and ensure your subbies keep to their booked times. The longer the job takes the greater the risk of a claim.
Don’t leave valuable items on site longer than necessary.
Install a security alarm.
Identify and eliminate hazards associated with electrical fires, such as from lithium batteries, cables, switchboards, control panels, lighting appliances and equipment. Have a maintenance programme and safety checklists, smoke alarms and fire extinguishers readily available.
Ask neighbours and tradespeople working at nearby sites to keep an eye out for suspicious behaviour and to record vehicle details.
Weatherproof the site and exposed materials.
Premium reduction:
Be as accurate as possible with your build timeframes – the longer the project takes, the more the insurance costs. Extensions to the policy cost money too and it is usually much more cost effective to add on an extra month or two when you first take it out rather than paying for extensions later on.
The information presented in this article is general in nature and not intended to be advice for individual situations. You should speak to an expert about your specific circumstances and needs .

TITLE   : Interim liquidation disrupts builders’ policies

CBL Insurance LTD (CBL), which underwrote a number of building insurance specialist Builtin’s policies, has been placed into interim liquidation, during which time no claims can be paid
The New Zealand insurer is responsible for underwriting Builtin’s liability and indemnity policies, while Builtin also distributed CBL’s Homefirst Builders Guarantee. Builtin was CBL’s sole representative in New Zealand for these policies.
What happened to CBL?
Following an application to the High Court from the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, CBL has been placed into interim liquidation following concerns about its solvency.
This application was made because, during the Reserve Bank’s investigation into its solvency, CBL made payments worth $55 million to companies within its European division – a direct violation of the Reserve Bank’s orders.
As a result, the company was placed into interim liquidation on 23 February by the High Court.
Citing the liquidation, CBL informed the NZX it will not be releasing its preliminary results announcement for the year ended 31 December 2017, which were due on 1 March. Its rating has also been downgraded from an A to an E.
In its 2017 half-year result, the company reported cash and cash equivalents of $445 million and actual solvency capital of $160 million.
Independent insurance broker CBA Insurances also issued a clarification to its customers last week after some customers mistook the issues with CBL Insurance Limited as affecting their broker. According to its statement, CBA Insurances is not affected by the interim liquidation of CBL Insurance Limited as it has arranged alternative cover for affected clients.
What does it mean for Builtin customers?
Many Builtin customers affected by the interim liquidation of CBL Insurance Limited are already covered by an alternative insurer, but the company is encouraging anyone who is concerned or unsure to contact them to allay their fears.
Builtin marketing manager Ben Rickard said that advice from the interim liquidators stated that CBL was still accepting and processing claims, but that no payments would be made until the interim liquidation was resolved. In the meantime, the team at Builtin has been working hard to arrange alternative cover for its customers.
“We’re doing our best to make sure our customers are covered while this process is worked through,” said Mr Rickard. “CBL was an A-rated insurer and we had no reason to doubt its reputation, nor had we received any notice that they were being investigated by the Reserve Bank.”
For those who have renewed or taken out a liability or indemnity policy in the past few weeks, an alternative arrangement had already been made with The Hollard Insurance Company Pty Limited (rated A-).
Other policyholders wanting to arrange immediate cover for the remainder of their policy period will need to pay an additional premium to the new insurer and should contact Builtin to arrange it. Customers whose policies are due for renewal will be automatically placed with Hollard Insurance.
Mr Rickard said they will be requesting a credit from CBL for those who cancel their policy, the amount of which will be dependent on the outcome of the interim liquidation.
Homefirst Builders Guarantee customers with houses still under construction or within 12 months of completion can apply for a new ten-year guarantee, which is backed by Lloyds of London (rated A+). Again, the possibility of a credit from CBL will depend on the outcome of the interim liquidation.
Mr Rickard said that they are currently working to find a solution for people with policies on a house that has been completed for longer than 12 months.
He said that people who have claims pending with CBL would be unable to transfer those to another insurer and will have to wait until the interim liquidation is resolved to receive any potential payment.
He stressed it was important to note it was only an interim liquidation, which is when liquidators are appointed to preserve the company’s assets pending determination over whether or not to place the company into final liquidation.
In this case, the Reserve Bank took the step to ensure no more assets or cash could be distributed overseas. It is not yet clear how long it will take to resolve the process, or what the ultimate result will be. Were the company to be placed into final liquidation, Mr Rickard said policyholders with outstanding claims would be treated as unsecured creditors.

Ever been asked to sign off work you haven’t supervised? If you’re unsure of the quality, you should think twice before putting your name to someone else’s work.
Builtin New Zealand has received many calls from builders, who’ve been asked by their employer to sign off the work of non-LBPs. The Building Act does not prevent building companies using (potentially) cheaper, lower-skilled labour for restricted building work (RBW); however, this must be signed off by an LBP to comply with the law. LBPs who contact us want to know what liability they’re taking on for signing off this work, and what insurance is available to protect them. This article will focus on two key areas: licence offences and liability arising from negligence.
Firstly, it’s important to note that the LBP scheme does not increase a builder’s liability (aside from the possibility of complaints being made to the Building Practitioners Board and the penalties they may impose). It should also be noted that when you complete Records of Work (RoW), you’re not considered to be ‘signing off’ anything, merely recording the work that was either done or supervised by you. What this means is that if there’s a problem in the future, the details of who did what work are recorded on the council file, so it’s much easier to track that person down and hold them accountable.
Non-LBPs will be in breach of the Building Act 2004 if they carry out RBW while not supervised by an LBP. This could result in a fine of up to $20,000.
LBPs cannot do or supervise work outside their licence class. For example, a carpentry LBP who supervises installation of tile or membrane roofing (essentially anything other than lightweight profiled metal) would be in breach of the Act and liable for a fine of up to $20,000.
For LBPs, supervision is defined under the Act as to:
“provide control or direction and oversight […] to an extent that is sufficient to ensure the building work is performed competently and complies with the building consent”.
If you cannot be sure that the work was performed competently and complies with the building consent, you should not sign the RoW. If you did not provide control or direction and oversight of the work, you should be very wary of putting your name to the RoW.
The Building Practitioners Board may use Section 317 of the Act to discipline an LBP who signs RoW for work they did not supervise, on the basis that the LBP “supervised […] building work in a negligent or incompetent manner”.
Penalties that can be imposed by the Building Practitioners Board under Section 318 (see textbox) include licence cancellation, suspension, restriction, requiring additional training and/or imposing a fine of up to $10,000. You may also be required to pay all or a portion of the costs of the inquiry.
Of potentially more concern is the liability an LBP is exposed to from inadequately supervising the work of other people. Supervising others is not necessarily an issue – most trades have supervised apprentices. As long as you know your stuff and are confident the work was done well, there should be no cause for concern.
However, if something does go wrong with the work you supervised, you may be held liable for the loss caused to someone else (such as the customer, or even a subsequent owner of the property). If the courts agree that you had a duty of care to the plaintiff and they have suffered a loss as a result of your negligence, you could be faced with a big bill. This would be on top of your own legal bills, which can quickly run into tens of thousands.
” If you cannot be sure that the work was performed competently and complies with the building consent, you should not sign the Record of Work
Putting your name to the RoW makes it easier to track you down when a problem arises. If anything you’ve written is wrong, you may also be held liable for making a “negligent misstatement”.
The law generally views it as desirable for companies to assume responsibility for the acts of their employees. This is because the company is making profit from the activity and is more likely to be able to afford to pay for mistakes, to charge rates that include a margin to cover the cost of mistakes, to arrange insurance and to implement and enforce good work practices and training.
Until recently, New Zealand employees were not generally held liable for actions they carried out on behalf of an employer. In practice, this meant that if you made a mistake on a job you completed, the company you were working for carried the can and was unlikely to claim against you to recover its costs.
However, recent court decisions have opened the door to holding individuals liable for their actions, even when under employment, if they have “assumed responsibility” for them. While this isn’t a result of a change in legislation, case law – the law as established by the outcome of former cases – often shapes subsequent interpretation of the law.
This recent case law has meant a re-think of whether an employee could be held liable for a negligent misstatement, or what could be described as mistakes, errors or omissions in advice or documents, such as RoW. Again, it could now be argued that, as an LBP, you have a duty of care to accurately record the work that was done. If you fail to do so, you could be held liable individually.
Unfortunately, this area of law is uncertain and clear guidance is difficult – all we’re saying is that you need to be very careful!
Good work practices are the first line of defence from liability. Only putting your name to work you have actually supervised and accurately recording the work completed is a good start.
Good work practices also include ensuring your paperwork is in order. If you’re employed or contracted to supervise building work and are required to use your personal LBP details on RoW, what does your contract say about your liability if an error is made while working on behalf of your employer?
Generally, your public liability insurance covers you for accidental damage to other people’s property, excluding damage caused by faulty workmanship. It does not cover you for claims of a purely financial nature, where someone is alleging that you’ve cost them money because of a service you’ve provided, or mistake you’ve made. For this you need a form of professional indemnity insurance.
There are a number of professional indemnity options available for LBPs, but you should be very clear about what cover you’re actually getting under the policy you choose – and what you’re not. Most of the LBPs who contact us are concerned about getting dragged into a court case and having to pay a share of any damages. The most expensive cases often include the cost of rectifying defective work, so naturally this is what most builders will want insurance cover to include.
1.    Does my employer’s policy cover me?
2.    What happens if I move on or my employer goes bust; am I still covered?
3.    Am I covered for defending complaints to the Building Practitioners Board about my work?
4.    If I signed off work outside my licence class, will I be covered?
5.    Am I covered for fines and penalties?
6.    Does the policy cover the cost of court awarded damages if these include rectifying faulty or defective work?
Most LBP professional indemnity policies cover the costs associated with complaints to the licensing board, fines and penalties and errors made in RoW. But this cover does not extend to paying the cost of rectifying defective work, even if the courts find you liable for this.
More comprehensive professional indemnity cover is available for building contractors and project managers, such as Builtin’s Error & Omissions Indemnity cover. This tends to be more expensive, but the cover is much wider.
If you’re contracting through a company, or even working as an employee doing site supervision, you may want to consider having your own policy. This means if you go on to work for someone else, or your employer/principal contractor goes bust, your policy is not affected. You may even be able to negotiate that the cost of the insurance is paid for by your employer, or build it into your contract rates.
The advent of the LBP scheme has increased awareness within the building trade of the liability that builders face. This includes the work you do, as well as the work you supervise, as you have a duty of care to ensure that it is fit for purpose. Other building professionals such as engineers, inspectors, architects and designers have been dealing with this reality for many years and professional indemnity insurance is simply a cost of doing business for them. In today’s world, it’s now a cost of doing business for builders and project managers too, especially LBPs.
(1) In any case to which section 317 applies, the Board may –
(a) do both of the following things: (i) cancel the person’s licensing and direct the Registrar to remove the person’s name from the register; and (ii) order that the person may not apply to be relicensed before the expiry of a specified period:
(b) suspend the person’s licensing for a period of no more than 12 months or until the person meets specified conditions relating to the licensing (but, in any case, not for a period of more than 12 months) and direct the Registrar to record the suspension in the register:
(c) restrict the type of building work or building inspection work that the person may carry out or supervise under the person’s licensing class or classes and direct the Registrar to record the restriction in the register:
(d) order that the person be censured:
(e) order that the person undertake training specified in the order:
(f) order that the person pay a fine not exceeding $10,000.
(2) The Board may take only 1 type of action in subsection (1)(a) to (d) in relation to a case, except that it may impose a fine under subsection (1)(f) in addition to taking the action under subsection (1)(b) or (d).
(3) No fine may be imposed under subsection (1)(f) in relation to an act or omission that constitutes an offence for which the person has been convicted by a court.
(4) In any case to which section 317 applies, the Board may order that the person must pay the costs and expenses of, and incidental to, the inquiry by the Board.
(5) In addition to requiring the Registrar to notify in the register an action taken by the Board under this section, the Board may publicly notify the action in any other way it thinks fit.

In our final article in the four-part series on managing risk for trade businesses, we focus on the risk of something happening to key people in the business (that means you)
Construction is a risky business, more so than most, yet many builders don’t spend enough time really understanding their risk environment and putting in place strategies to manage, avoid or transfer that risk.
Property
Liability
Financial
Personal/Family
Is your business’s most valuable asset insured? What would happen to your income if that asset suddenly went out of action?
Here are the facts:
According to ACC statistics, the area most commonly injured by residential builders is the lower back/spine. On average, those injured are on ACC for more than two months.
According to the Ministry of Health, there are over 10,000 cases of cancer among New Zealand men each year, with the most common forms being prostate, colorectal and melanoma. If you’re between 25-44 years old, melanoma is most likely, if you’re more than 44 years old, it’s prostate cancer.
No one likes to think that it will happen to them, but the reality is that it can. And if you have a family that relies on your income, no doubt you want to make sure they’ll be looked after if something does happen. So what are the things to think about?
A safe workplace and healthy lifestyle are the best insurance, as is an annual health check-up that can pick up problems early. However, prevention can only go so far and you never know what may happen – be it accident or illness – down the road.
When it comes to accidents which affect your ability to earn income – either at home or at work – New Zealand’s unique ACC scheme has most scenarios covered.
For work-related injuries, ACC covers accidents, conditions that come on gradually because of your work, and infections or diseases caused at work by a particular task or environmental exposure, among others.
Injuries caused outside of work are covered as well.
However, ACC’s compensation payouts for ‘loss of earnings’ are linked to your income so, because it’s quite common for builders to have income levels that fluctuate monthly, they may sometimes receive lower pay-outs than they might expect.
To avoid having this occur, many self-employed people opt out of the default ACC scheme and choose ACC Cover Plus Extra. This means you set an agreed income threshold and will be paid a guaranteed amount in the event of a claim. Combined with private insurance for illness and income protection, this can be very cost effective and substantially broaden your cover.
Cancer, heart disease and diabetes are the top three causes of illness for men in New Zealand, none of which are covered by ACC. For any self-employed person with a family that relies on their income, it’s worth having personal insurance to cover the possibility of a worst case scenario. Here are the most common options:
Life insurance Pays a lump sum upon your death. This could pay off the mortgage, clear other debts or go towards your kids’ education.
Permanent disability Pays a lump sum in the event of permanent disability. This can be linked to your ability to return to your previous occupation, or to work in any job.
Trauma Pays a lump sum in the event of certain illnesses that require medical attention and/or surgery.
Income protection Pays a selected percentage of lost income if you become disabled or unable to work due to illness or injury. Beneficial in circumstances where ACC payments are limited or not payable.
Private health insurance For urgent or emergency treatment, you will be looked after by the public health system. However, if you need to see a specialist, have non-acute surgery or a diagnostic procedure such as an MRI, the public system will put you on a waiting list. This is where health insurance can help, providing faster access to treatment by avoiding public hospital waiting lists.
Key Person insurance A key person is someone in the business responsible for generating business income. It may also apply to an individual whose loss has a significant operational impact, such as a project manager. Key Person cover pays an agreed monthly benefit to a business for a set period if a key person is disabled because of a continuing sickness or injury.
This type of insurance is best discussed with an authorised financial adviser, who will build a picture of your needs and put together a package that best suits your situation. Financial advisers in New Zealand must be licensed and are regulated by the Financial Markets Authority. They are subject to strict disclosure and compliance requirements, much like builders are now. If you’d like to speak to an adviser in your area, please give the team at Builtin a ring and we can put you in touch with someone from our network.
This is the final article in this series about managing the risk faced by businesses in the construction industry. Let us know if there are any other insurance or guarantee related topics that you’d like to read about in future issues.

Tool theft is becoming increasingly common and if it hasn’t happened to you, you’ve probably heard of it happening to someone you know. We’re urging all builders to take extra measures to ensure your tools are secured
Here’s a short overview of what has been happening around the country.
Tauranga: There has been a concerning increase in the number of tradies being targeted by thieves, particularly in the Papamoa area. In October, police stopped a vehicle that was carrying a number of stolen tools and other items.
Thieves often target work vehicles parked on the street or in driveways at night while owners are asleep. Police say utility trucks, particularly with canopies, and vans seem to be the most targeted vehicles.
Wanaka: In October, police carried out a search warrant on a Wanaka building site and recovered a substantial amount of stolen timber, scaffolding and a large amount of other building material and builders’ tools.
The local man found responsible was charged with two building-site burglaries and two commercial storage-yard burglaries in the Queenstown and Wanaka area, and is likely to face further charges.
Otago: Dunedin residents haved faced a series of burglaries, including tools being stolen from building sites, cars and vans. Dunedin police are warning tradies to keep their valuable tools out of sight after the vehicles were broken into overnight, in what was described as an ‘opportunistic theft’.
While tools are heavy, they’re often stored in bags which makes them easier to steal. Parking work vehicles in driveways did not seem deter offenders.
Auckland: Earlier this year, a carpenter had $12,000 of tools and his car stolen. Because he had no tools (and they were not insured), he was unable to work for two weeks.
Builtin’s experience: There has been a sharp increase in insurance claims for stolen tools over the past 12 months. There is also an increasing trend of tradies being the target of multiple robberies, with the thief waiting a few weeks until tools are replaced before hitting them again.
What should you do?
We strongly urge you to reduce the risk of thieves targeting your tools, and increase the chances of having them returned, by following these simple tips:
Label tools using with a UV security pen (police can provide these) and use your mobile, driver’s licence or LBP number as an identifier.
Keep a register of your tools. This will help police if they recover them, as well as making an insurance claim much quicker.
Deliver materials and appliances to site only when required.
When the joinery is delivered, install it. Don’t leave it in the open where there is a higher chance of items being taken.
Keep any tools and materials secured on site and, ideally, out of sight.
Secure trailers with a towbar lock, so they can’t be stolen (with all your tools on board).
Don’t park your van on the street loaded with tools (and always lock it)!
Install a Van Vault-type secure container in your vehicle. These are a great deterrent to opportunist thieves.
Alarm/immobilise your vehicles.
Tools insurance
Premiums are not as expensive as you may think, although the amount of claims is putting pressure on rates. Here are our top tips to make sure you’re getting the cover you need:
Replacement value vs indemnity value
Replacement value cover will replace stolen items with brand new ones, regardless of their age or condition when pinched. Beware — some policies that claim to be for replacement value will revert to market value on items more than a few years old, so check the fine print. With indemnity value policies, you’ll only get what the item was worth when it was stolen (its depreciated value) and you have to make up the difference.
Trailers
These should be insured as commercial vehicles, as they can’t be insured under a tools policy.
Theft vs burglary
Tool policies make a distinction between theft and burglary. Theft is generally considered to be when an item is stolen ‘in the open air’ (without any sign of forced entry). So, it would be considered theft if tools were stolen from an unlocked van or site, but burglary if locked doors were forced or a window smashed to gain entry. Some policies include burglary but not theft in the open air and you need to understand what you’re getting.
Know your excess
Even if your policy does include theft in the open air, theft excesses can differ. The policy might advertise a $500 excess, but it’s common to see a $1,000 excess for burglary and $2,500 for theft. You can find policies with options for lower burglary excesses and specialist trade insurers such as Builtin offer a $1,000 excess for theft also.
Getting a claim settled quickly
There are three main things that will help you get your tool theft claim settled quickly:
Having an insurer who understands that tradies need their claim sorted asap, so they can get back to work.
Having proof of ownership (invoices/receipts, photos and/or an up-to-date asset register so you can provide the details of your loss quickly).
Sending in your claim form, along with a police report and the proof of ownership immediately.
In a nutshell
Having your tools stolen can be a massive inconvenience, causing delays and costing money. Taking preventative measures, keeping good records and having the right insurance cover will ensure that if something does happen, you can be back to work quickly and not be out of pocket.

How changes to the Construction Contracts Act could affect your retentions
N ew rules for protecting retention money came into effect on 31 March. These require developers and head contractors to hold ‘on trust’ any retention money they’ve withheld from their subcontractors.
This obligation, which only applies to commercial contracts, means the head contractor must hold that retention money in the form of cash or other readily convertible liquid assets, making it easier, in theory, for subbies to reclaim this money if the head contractor goes bust.
The problem with this model is that withholding retention money from subbies, but then having to account for it under trust obligations, is an inefficient use of capital in an industry that struggles with both equity and cashflow issues.
A new alternative – payment bonds
On March 30, Parliament passed a further amendment to the Construction Contracts Amendment Act (CCAA) allowing developers and head contractors to obtain an insurance-backed bond to cover the retention money they hold.
So, if the head contractor failed to pay back retentions, the subcontractor could claim them directly from the insurer. This ‘payment bond’ would most likely be capped at a certain level, different for each head contractor, who will be responsible for ensuring the amount of retentions they hold does not exceed this cap (or requesting an increase in their bond limit if it does).
A payment bond benefits subcontractors because they have a guarantee from a third party (the insurer or a bank) that they will get their money.
It also benefits the head contractors, because it means they don’t need to hold the retention money on trust.
They can use it and account for it within their business however they wish, as long as their insurance bond is enough to cover all the outstanding retentions they hold at any given time.
Another option – retention bonds
There is also another option, where the head contractor agrees to accept a bond in lieu of retentions (a retention bond) from the subcontractor instead of withholding retention money from each invoice.
This benefits the subcontractor because no retentions are withheld in the first place, so there is no danger of losing them and they get paid in full. However, a premium would be payable on each bond.
It also benefits the head contractor because they have no ‘on trust’ obligations.
The drawback for them is that they can’t use retentions as a form of revenue to fund their business (although this is not necessarily good business practice in the first place and part of the reason retentions are now being held ‘on trust’ or in a financial instrument). Retentions bonds are readily accepted under most major construction contracts.
The insurer’s view
Bonds are already common in large construction projects, where they protect the principal by guaranteeing that contractors will complete the project.
The basic principle of insurance is to transfer risk from one party to the other, in return for payment of a premium.
This frees up money, such as retentions, that the main contractor would otherwise have had to set aside to cover unforeseen costs.
This money can instead be invested in the contractor’s or subcontractor’s business, meaning that a bond-based model for retentions could lead to improvements in the overall financial health of the industry.
How do I apply?
The process for applying for an insurance-backed bond is simple. The contractor completes an initial assessment, which covers details such as their financial solvency and management structure.
This is effectively the insurer’s underwriting criteria, which they use to make sure they’re taking on ‘good risk’.
Once this is approved, the contractor simply applies for a bond each time they need one, in much the same way as they would for other insurance cover.
Premiums vary depending on the size and scale of the job, defects liability period and the amount of the bond required.
In a nutshell
If you’re a subcontractor who has retentions withheld, for any new contracts from 31 March, your head contractor must hold these retentions on trust, which means they have to account for them in cash or other readily convertible form.
If proposed amendments come into law, head contractors could insure the retentions they hold instead of holding them on trust.
A subcontractor can provide a retention bond instead of having cash retentions withheld in the first place, so they get paid in full and there’s no risk of losing their retentions.

Last month, we discussed the liability risks your business faces and how best to manage them. In our third article in this series, we focus on finance
Construction is a risky business, more so than most, yet many builders don’t spend enough time really understanding their risk environment and putting in place strategies to manage, avoid or transfer that risk.
Property
Liability
Financial
Personal/Family
Unfortunately, it is a fact that over half of all New Zealand construction businesses will have failed after just four years*. Mainzeal’s 2013 collapse served to highlight the risk facing many sub-contractors working for a principal contractor: the danger of not getting paid for work done and/or losing retention money that has been withheld. More than 1,000 sub-contractors and other unsecured creditors have made claims in excess of $150m and, two years on, are still waiting to hear if they will receive any of their monies.
Alongside the risk of a big collapse are smaller bad debts that can seriously affect the viability of small building companies. Margins are tight in construction; we have heard many times of a builder gone bust because just one customer failed to pay, leading to a cascade of cashflow issues, inability to pay creditors on time and, ultimately, liquidation.
However, there are a number of ways building companies can reduce their risk of financial failure:
The agreement you have up front will set out how you are to be paid and when; getting this right is crucial. Trade associations have comprehensive contracts that include protections for builders.
Don’t wait until the end of the month to do your invoicing. Where possible, they should be issued immediately upon job completion or when a relevant milestone is achieved. Modern accounting systems will allow you to do this quickly and easily; talk to your accountant. You can even email invoices and take card payments using your smartphone these days, so you get paid straightaway; talk to your bank about this.
“Rather than allow retention money to be withheld from your payments, you could supply a retention bond. This is a promise to the main contractor that you will fulfil the contract and it is backed up by a bank or insurance company
Additionally, the Construction Contracts Act includes provisions to enforce your rights to be paid for the work you have done in a timely manner. Make sure your payment claims comply with the requirements of the Act and you’ll be in a much stronger position to get paid if there is a problem. Trade associations and some merchants offer templates of these.
Your accounting system should immediately alert you if a payment you’re owed has not been made by the due date. Having a robust system for chasing these is another key tool to manage cashflow and avoid bad debts building up. Again, modern accounting systems will do this for you.
Knowing in advance when you’ll need to make payments and when money will come in is critical to being able to plan for any “pinch points”. A rolling six-month forecast will give you a good idea of what the future financial health of the business is, and what actions you’ll need to take to correct any issues before they become a problem. Your accountant can help you with this.
Ideally, every business should have a monthly review of its financial health. How profitable is it? What is your return on capital? What is your working capital situation? Back-costing jobs will also mean you’re learning from past projects and ensuring future ones are profitable. With a good accountant and modern accounting system, this is achievable for even the smallest building business.
Possibly, as in the case of Mainzeal, an event out of your control could put severe financial strain on your business, and, consequently, your family, employees and suppliers. Insurance is available to cover the risk of a main contractor going bust and leaving their subbies unpaid. Called a trade or sub-contractors payment guarantee, it pays 75% of the money owed, up to a chosen limit. For more information on this visit: www.builtin.co.nz/SCPG .
The government has announced plans that will require all retention money to be held “in trust” by the main contractor. This means they can’t use it for their own day-to-day operation, and must keep it separately. However, your money is still in their bank account instead of yours.
Rather than allow retention money to be withheld from your payments, you could supply a retention bond. This is a promise to the main contractor that you will fulfil the contract and it is backed up by a bank or insurance company.
Instead of having your cash locked up in retentions by your main contractor, you simply pay a non-refundable premium to the bond provider and they make the promise for you, thus freeing up your cash to be put to better use. For more information on this, visit: www.builtin.co.nz/retentionbonds .
Even though the industry is a tough one, with good financial systems, procedures and forecasts, as well as the right contract terms and insurance in place, withstanding unforeseen financial shocks is possible for any business.
The final article in this series will focus on how insurance can help manage the risk of personal injury or illness and its effects on your ability to continue working and providing for your family.

PLI is one of the most important policies a tradesman can have – but understanding all the terms contained within them can be tricky; that’s why the helpful guys at Builtin have provided a list of definitions to make things a bit clearer.
PLI is intended to protect you from the cost of accidentally damaging other people’s property or causing them injury.
This article is intended to clarify some of the definitions contained within most general/public liability policies available from major insurers in New Zealand. The specific wording from different insurers will vary and you should seek the advice of an insurance professional, if necessary. Insurers will interpret and apply their own policy wording, depending on the specific circumstances of each individual claim.
For a claim to be made, there must first be either accidental damage to property, loss of property (that isn’t actually damaged) or loss of use of property.
For a claim to be made, the accidental damage must result from a single event. This event must be unforeseen and unintended from the standpoint of the policy holder.
Unfortunately, there is no accepted insurance definition of faulty workmanship, which is why it can be such a contentious issue at claim time. Was damage caused accidentally or as a result of poor workmanship? Your view might be quite different from that of your insurance company. If your policy does not include cover for faulty workmanship, you could find your claim is declined.
The policy can also cover the indirect costs of damage you cause: eg, the cost of lost sales due to a power failure, if you cut through a power cable, or the subsequent water damage to walls and carpets caused by a leaky pipe.
Your own products are not covered by the policy. This can include anything you have constructed once it is no longer in your possession or control. It’s important you have a policy that is tailored to the building industry, otherwise your liability for damage to a house you’ve built could be excluded from cover.
Builtin New Zealand is a specialist in construction insurance, with policies tailored to meet the needs of builders & tradespeople, including cover for faulty workmanship and damage to the building you’re working on.

Most business owners don’t really understand how to put strategies in place to manage, avoid or transfer risk. This article, the first in a series, will help you assess the various risks your business faces and put processes in place to deal with them
Life used to be simple; it was about survival – finding enough to eat and avoiding being eaten by a sabre-toothed tiger!
But as a business owner in the modern world, there’s a lot to think about. One of the most fundamental problems is how to minimise the risks facing:
Your business.
Your customers.
Your suppliers.
The public.
Yourself.
Your family.
Property
Liability
Financial
Personal/family
Our experience over the last ten years has shown that thinking about risk in terms of these four areas works well for most building professionals. In the next four articles, we’ll cover each of these in more detail. Once you’ve identified all the various possible risks, evaluate them against these two criteria:
The likelihood of it happening.
The cost if it did.
In our experience, assessing risk in this way often takes away people’s worries, and they become much more positive about their situation. This process helps turn risks into a known quantity (not a heavy weight on your shoulders) that can be dealt with, whether this involves insurance, new processes, training or simply a decision to acknowledge the risk and do nothing.
The above table is one example of how to assess your own risk.
Create a table for each of the four areas of risk, then list all the potential hazards that you can think of. It’s a good idea to do this with someone else, such as a business partner, spouse or even someone outside your business, such as your accountant. They add a different perspective and can often see things you can’t, because you’re so close to the business.
Use your gut feeling and experience to decide how likely the particular hazard/event is and give it a score. Often thinking whether one risk is more or less likely than another helps choose a score.
Next, consider the possible cost to you if the particular event was to happen. Would it be something you could handle, or would it break the bank? Again, considering the cost of each event compared to the others helps decide which are the most costly.
Multiply the two scores to give a ranking of the risks you face.
Rank all the risks on that final score.  Write next to each one what you are doing to avoid, reduce or transfer that particular risk, starting with the ones with the highest score and working down.
By focusing on the risks with the highest score, you’re prioritising the areas that will have the most impact on you and your business.
“In our experience, assessing risk in this way often takes away people’s worries, and they become much more positive about their situation
Are you providing training in the right areas?
Is your security adequate?
Do you have the right procedures in place?
What’s your plan B?
Are the right risks insured?
Everyone has their own tolerance for risk; what you might think is low risk may be medium or high risk for another.  However, by approaching your risk in this way, you’re able to prioritise and deal with it in a manner appropriate to your situation.
The next article will focus specifically on property, which includes the risk to buildings, vehicles, building sites and other material assets that can be lost or damaged.

TITLE   : Understanding guarantees

Are professional organisations that require builders to offer ten-year guarantees pre-empting the government, or should builders and homeowners still have the freedom to choose what guarantees they offer and accept?
T he Certified Builders Association recently announced that it is now mandatory for all members to give their clients an independent ten-year guarantee for work above $30,000. The announcement brings them into line with similar requirements for Registered Master Builders.
This has prompted many builders to ask what the difference is between a homeowner’s rights under the Building Act and the cover in one of these ten-year guarantees.
Put bluntly, if a building company is still trading then its customers can use the Building Act and other legal means to enforce their rights. However, if the company has closed down, its contractual and legal obligations can’t be enforced, because the company no longer exists.
Many builders say that’s okay, we don’t plan on going bust! The issue is that your customers can’t be sure you’ll be around for the next ten years if something does go wrong (and frankly, neither can you).
Unfortunately, some high-profile cases of building companies going bust have increased the public’s concern about this.
We don’t need to tell you about the pressures of running a building business, even the best sometimes get into difficulty and often through no fault of their own. This is why homeowners and their banks will often require an independent guarantee.
How does an independent builder’s guarantee benefit homeowners?
Third-party guarantees, such as Builtin’s Homefirst Builders Guarantee, reassure homeowners that they will:
Protect the homeowner’s deposit.
Complete the build if their builder can’t, as well as covering the extra costs to do so.
Fix defects for up to ten years.
They are a guarantee of the builder’s obligations under their contract and in law. In a recent case in Christchurch, more than $1 million was paid on behalf of affected homeowners after their builder went bust, many of whom would otherwise have lost their deposit or faced increased costs to complete their homes or fix defective work.
Do builders have to provide them?
No. The new disclosure rules that came into force in 2015 only require you to disclose whether you can offer a guarantee, not to provide one.
However, building trade associations require their members to provide them and the government is examining whether they should be made compulsory. Either way, as more homeowners, and their banks, require these guarantees, being able to offer one could help builders win business.
How do they benefit builders?
It used to be that these guarantees didn’t benefit builders at all; however, this is changing. For example, under the Homefirst Builders Guarantee (HBG), if there is a claim after your initial 12-month defects liability period ends, the insurer will not chase you to recover their costs (although they may seek recovery from your subcontractors if they were at fault).
This effectively insures the builder from the cost of rectifying those defects that are covered by the HBG. Homefirst also includes $10,000 cover to refund deposits paid by the builder to a component supplier who then goes bust.
Overseas examples
In many Australian states, it’s a legal requirement for builders to provide what they call a home warranty for every project, and they can’t be licensed without first being approved to provide warranty cover. In the UK, more than 80% of all new homes are covered by a third-party ten-year guarantee, although the scheme there is optional.
In New Zealand, the current approach is to ensure the client understands up front, before they sign a contract, whether or not their builder is offering a guarantee and what that guarantee covers.
In a nutshell
You can’t predict what might happen to you or your business, certainly not over a period of ten years. It’s the reason you insure for any risk and it’s why third-party builder’s guarantees are increasingly being asked for by homeowners and their banks. For builders, depending on which guarantee you offer, they also now give cover for you too.

Building and Construction minister Chris Penk recently announced that the Government is looking to “lift the competence of building professionals” and increase penalties as a way of improving efficiency and reducing the cost of building work. In this article, construction insurance expert Ben Rickard discusses whether the changes, particularly regarding self-certification and liability, will have the intended effect
In my view, none of the changes proposed will improve efficiency or reduce cost. The factors driving down efficiency and increasing the cost of building aren’t a lack of competence or penalties, but the fact that the market for builders is made up of thousands of small firms and individuals. Even the larger group housing companies make up a relatively small proportion of the overall market.
Did the introduction of the Licenced Building Practitioner (LBP) regime and the existing penalties in the Building Act improve the situation? I’d like to see some data on that. If the answer is no, why would more “competence and accountability requirements” change the situation? And even if it does, there will be other consequences, such as more people choosing to leave the sector. Additional requirements will increase the industry’s barriers to entry, which is likely to reduce the supply of builders, leading to an increase in the cost to build!
To my untrained eye, this seems like simple economics. Plumbers and electricians have relatively high barriers to entry and get paid a lot more than builders, so while it could be a positive step to address the relatively low rates builders earn given the risk they are exposed to, the proposed regulation changes may have the opposite effect from that which was intended.
Will consent opt-outs work?
The Government has also committed, as part of its coalition agreement with ACT New Zealand, to look at the feasibility of allowing builders to opt out of a building consent, or presumably some inspection requirements, if they have adequate insurance. The assumption is that by “lifting the competence” of building professionals, insurance companies will be prepared to enter this market. While this is certainly possible, I think it is a stretch to say that it will materially improve efficiency and reduce cost. It’s almost certain that insurers will want inspections to be undertaken as a condition of underwriting any risk, so just because a Building Consent Authority (BCA) is not doing the inspection, doesn’t mean inspections don’t need to be done, and someone has to pay for that. Would it be cheaper and less risky if this work is outsourced to the private sector? I’m not sure history would agree.
Long-tail risk, like committing to remediate defective building work for up to 10 years, is a big ask for insurers. This is why the market in Australia is almost exclusively backed by state governments and why the two largest players in the New Zealand market are trade associations that essentially self-insure this risk.
That’s not to say it’s not possible. We have had an insurance-backed market for builders guarantees in the past and we could again. However, in my view, the likelihood is more about global appetites for risk from insurers than any tinkering around the edges of a competence and penalty regime here.
What’s the solution?
I think a single, nationwide BCA makes a lot of sense in terms of improving efficiency and consistency. For all their faults, organisations like the Natural Hazards Commission and ACC solve problems that markets have struggled with. A national BCA could deliver consents and inspections through a consistent and unified programme that insurers could have confidence in. This, in conjunction with additional underwriting of the building company (such as of their quality assurance systems, financial solvency and contractual terms) by insurers could attract insurers to the market. Those builders accredited by insurers would be able to provide 10-year guarantees to their customers. Those who aren’t accredited would not. The Government could mandate that only accredited builders can perform Restricted Building Work, or use some other benchmark, above which the ability to provide an independently insured guarantee would be compulsory in order to do the work.
In the event of a claim, the insurer would bear the cost of assessing and remedying the defect, while retaining their ability seek recovery of their costs from the responsible builder (if they were still around). In this way, the consumer is protected but the builder is still liable for their work. Too many claims and the builder would lose their accreditation.
The BCA, via a levy, could act as a back-up in situations where a builder has not supplied a guarantee when legally required to do so. That way, the consumer is still protected. Failing to supply a guarantee when legally required to do so could be an offence, punishable with a big fine for the company and the directors personally (since it is most likely that the company that would have gone into liquidation).
The BCA, which is doing the consenting and inspecting, could work in conjunction with insurers to reduce the compliance requirements for low-risk builders. Equally, the insurer would be able to utilise inspection data to inform their underwriting of the builder. This would have the added benefit of incentivising builders to make sure they are using the inspection system as it is intended.
Inspection data would need to be of good enough quality for insurers to determine the difference between different types of inspection fails. At least with a single BCA, there is likely to be more consistency of approach and therefore more reliable data.
In a nutshell
The Government wants to reduce the cost of building, while also improving quality and protecting consumers. They want to do this by improving efficiency, which seems to mean moving the cost of consenting on to the builder (compliance) and the private/insurance sector.
In my opinion, the Government must get their own house in order first by improving the efficiency of the consenting and inspection regime before imposing more requirements and penalties on builders. Having a well-run national consenting and inspecting organisation is more likely to attract insurers into the market to provide long-tail liability coverage for building defects.
This is an opinion piece by Ben Rickard, director of construction-focused risk adviser and insurance broking firm Builtin . Ben and Builtin have been providing insurance and risk advice to thousands of building businesses for more than a decade. He has made submissions on similar previous Government proposals and appeared before select committee on issues concerning joint & several liability and the viability of the market for builders guarantees in New Zealand.

With talk of merchants being out of stock, longer lead times and cost increases, we’re seeing more stockpiling of building materials than usual. Ben Rickard from Builtin Insurance talks us through the most cost-efficient way to ensure that extra stock is insured
On my recent road trip catching up with builders around the lower North Island, pretty much everyone raised the issue of supply of materials. This included merchants out of stock, much longer lead times on ordering materials and cost increases across the board.
Some of you may be tempted, as a number of our clients are already, to build up your own stock levels. That way, if merchants run out, at least you have some on hand and you can get by.
The value of this stock on hand can soon mount up, so you need to make sure it is covered by your insurance. Building materials are exposed to the usual risks of water damage, fire etc. And because they are in short supply, with prices rising every other week, they are an increasingly attractive target for thieves.
If these materials are allocated to a specific project, they can be covered by contract works insurance under the ‘offsite storage’ extension. This has a sub-limit and is only for materials for that particular job.
If you’ve bought materials that are not for a particular job, then your best bet is to make sure it is covered under a material damage policy. You may already have one that covers your tools and equipment, and stock can generally be added under this too. This is likely to be an ‘anywhere in New Zealand’ policy, so the stock is insured if stored at your yard, in your garage, in your vehicle (although this could be restricted in some cases) or on site. Be sure to increase your ‘sum insured’ by the value of the stock you’re carrying.
If you own premises (eg, a building or yard), the insurance on that building could be changed to include stock as well. Check the stock sum insured amount on your current cover and make sure you increase it if needed. Depending on the wording of your policy, the stock may only be insured at a specific address. If it might be transported or stored elsewhere, you will need to notify your insurer.
Asset register reminder
In February, a customer of ours had their vehicle broken into and tools stolen. Unfortunately, they did not have proof of ownership for some of the larger items, and this delayed settlement of the claim. We fought hard on our customer’s behalf and, when he managed to dig up some pictures of the items, the claim was then settled quickly.
This is a timely reminder that proof of ownership will help get your claim settled swiftly. This could be an asset register such as a spreadsheet or app that holds details of your tools or receipts and invoices or photos. Ideally, you would record each item’s details, serial number, date purchased and value. The same goes for any stock that you’re building up.
In a nutshell
Building materials and tools are always at risk of being stolen, damaged or lost, but recent claims suggest there is an even higher risk than normal of theft. Check the limit for offsite storage under your contract works policy is sufficient and, if you have building insurance, look to add cover for stock and materials too. Also, check if your policy says your materials and tools must be kept at one prescribed location. Understand whether that cover is only at a particular location or if they could be anywhere – such as in staff vehicles.

With the recent Sky City Convention Centre fire a hot topic, now is a good time to highlight the expectations insurers generally have around hot-work claims
Hot work is the use of welding, brazing, cutting, grinding, blow lamps, burning off or other flame or heat operating equipment. It is governed by NZS 4781, which is the relevant New Zealand Code of Practice for protecting people and property from the hazards that can arise from hot-work activities. See list of hazards on opposite page.
Most insurers will assess any hot work-related event against this standard. Failure to comply with it could result in your claim being declined.
Public liability insurance
These typically include a hot-work exclusion, with cover then brought back in again but subject to specific obligations/limits. In one example, you’ll be covered as long as you:
Comply with NZS 4781.
Comply with the conditions of any specific hot work permit.
Take all reasonable steps to minimise the risk of loss.
Depending on your occupation or the type of activity you perform, your policy may include further specific limitations or exclusions, a higher excess and a maximum limit to the amount you can claim (which could be lower than your headline policy limit).
The policy may also have a specific definition of what they consider hot work to be, so check that in your policy.
Contract works insurance
A contract works insurance policy may not specifically refer to hot work, but it will always require you to take reasonable care to avoid circumstances that could result in a claim. This includes not acting in a reckless or grossly irresponsible way. If a claim is made you could expect them to check very closely if you have complied with NZS 4781. Failing to do so could be grounds to decline  your claim.
Good practice
NZI has produced a helpful guide, to minimise your hot-work fire risk. To find it, Google ‘NZI hot work’. Among other things, it suggests you:
Use hot work permits to manage the on-site area.
Identify and remove any flammable materials or other fire hazards from the area if possible, including sweeping floors.
Wet down the immediate area if practical.
Use guards to confine heat and protect fire hazards that can’t be relocated. Nominate a “fire watch duty” and assign responsibilities to people for overseeing the work.
Conduct checks afterwards to check for hotspots.
Make sure a hose or extinguisher is immediately available.
Train operators to perform the work safely.
In a nutshell
Insurers are ‘hot’ on hot work, so if you have a claim related to this, you can expect they will look at it very closely. Make sure you’re complying with the appropriate NZ Standard and taking all the right precautions, including risk minimisation and operator training.

It’s easy to forget things when you’re thinking about Christmas and the holidays, as well as rushing to finish off projects for demanding customers – here are three summer reminders courtesy of Builtin
Secure your sites before you go (and take your tools with you)
Sites are more vulnerable when they’re closed up for the holidays, as no one is there regularly and neighbours may also be away on holiday. Make sure your sites are as secure as possible and store your tools somewhere safe off site.
Arrange travel insurance well before you leave
Don’t leave it to the last minute! You might not be able to get it at short notice and it’s even more difficult once you’ve started your trip. If you’re going overseas, don’t even think about leaving without it.
It’s well worth it compared to the cost of medical treatment, luggage loss or having to make alternative arrangements.
Insure any new vehicles, boats, jet skis, caravans, motor homes etc before you drive them away
It may be the last thing on your mind, but it’s important to arrange insurance on any substantial purchases before you collect them. This includes notifying your insurer of items that must be separately listed on your contents policy.
Murphy’s Law says it’s in the small window between picking up the new car and arranging the insurance that an accident will happen! Also, ensure the registration and warrant are up to date and the vehicle is in a good condition to be used for holiday travel (tyre pressure OK, lights work, oil checked etc). And remember to check that your driver’s licence is current!
It may be the last thing on your mind, but it’s important to arrange insurance on any substantial purchases before you collect them. This includes notifying your insurer of items that must be separately listed on your contents policy.
Thieves are especially active over Christmas, so any expensive gifts should be insured too.

TITLE   : TOP 12 CONTRACT WORKS QUERIES

Builtin shares its 12 most common contract works insurance questions
Whether you’re building new or doing an alteration, extension or renovation, your contract will require that contract works insurance is arranged. Even if you don’t have a contract – for example, if you’re doing a spec build, building your own house, or if the job is just a small one – you need to ensure this cover is in place.
1. What does it cover?
The policy covers sudden and accidental loss or damage to the works, including from:
Fire.
Theft.
Vandalism.
Construction collapse.
Storm and flood damage.
Natural disaster – earthquake, landslip, tsunami.
Other accidental damage to the contract works.
2. Who should take it out?
If it’s a full contract new build, most contracts will require the builder to arrange the policy. Make sure you include the value of any existing structures that need to be covered, materials supplied by the owner/principal and, if required, list the subcontractors that need to be covered too. You should also check that allowances for demolition, professional fees, removal of debris and cost inflation reflect the requirements of your contract.
If it’s labour-only, or an alteration, renovation or involves work to an existing structure, it is generally the owner’s responsibility to arrange contract works insurance. Most contracts will specify this and it’s for their protection as well as yours. Generally, it’s advisable for the owner to arrange it with the same company that insures the existing structure. However, sometimes this is not an option, as it could be too expensive or the existing structure may not be insured in the first place. If that’s the case, they can apply for Builtin’s contract works cover for alterations and renovations.
Even if the customer is arranging the policy, it should still include you and any subcontractors as insured parties.
Make sure you see a copy of the insurance certificate before you start work.
3. When do I take it out?
All too often, we hear from builders who want to arrange contract works insurance because “we’re ready to put the framing up”. They did not think they needed insurance for the earthworks or foundations, because “what could happen to these?”
However, significant flooding, landslip, collapse and earthquake are all hazards that could substantially damage earthworks, retaining and foundations, so should be insured during this phase of work.
Secondly, there is no significant saving to be had by arranging the cover later in the job, as the premium is largely based on the total value of the work, not the length of the policy.
It can also be more expensive, more difficult to arrange and can cause banks to delay releasing progress payments if cover is not arranged until after work has started, not to mention being in breach of your contract. So, save yourself the hassle by doing it before the work begins.
4. When does the policy end?
The wording of most policies states that they will automatically end on the earlier of:
Practical completion of the work.
When the owner starts using the building.
If it’s a spec, when 95% of the budget is spent.
The end date on the policy.
So, cover may automatically end once the owners move in, or even if they begin storing their stuff in completed parts of the building.
There could also be a gap in cover between practical completion and, if the CCC hasn’t been issued, when the owners can arrange house insurance.
Extending the contract works insurance won’t help your clients if the work has been finished, because there is no cover past practical completion, regardless of the end date on the policy.
5. Can I extend the policy?
If the project is delayed, you must remember to extend the policy. In general, we recommend adding a month or two on at the start. This is just to be on the safe side, in case there are unforeseen delays. This will cost less compared to having to arrange an extension later, or, worse still, forgetting to do so.
6. Who pays the excess?
The excess for damage caused by natural hazards has increased substantially since the Christchurch earthquakes and it varies by region. Insurers all calculate it differently and unless your contract says otherwise, you could be responsible for paying the whole excess.
We recommend you specify who pays the excess (or at least what proportion each party is responsible for) in your contract.
7. Does it cover existing structures on the site?
No, these are not automatically covered. Most contract works policies will only cover the works being built and, in some cases, temporary buildings such as a site office and signage.
Existing structures can be covered, but this cover is generally limited only to structures that will be worked on as part of the contract. So, if there is an existing shed, septic tank, or retaining wall, these will need to be insured separately. The owner of the existing structures is typically responsible for making sure they’re covered, but check the contract to be sure.
8. Does it cover faulty workmanship?
Damage caused by faulty workmanship is not covered by contract works insurance. It may be a liability insurance claim, but that will depend on the wording of your liability policy and whether a third party has suffered a loss.
9. Does it cover scratched glass?
Normally yes, if the glass was scratched by a reason listed in question 1. However, if the scratched glass is deemed to be the result of faulty workmanship, the cost of replacement may not be covered. The typical scenario is that ‘someone’ scratches the glass, perhaps when cleaning off splashes of paint or cement. Some insurers decline claims if NZ standards for glass cleaning aren’t followed. You should make sure everyone on site takes extreme care when cleaning or operating around glass.
10. Can I have an annual policy?
These can be very convenient and cost-effective if you build new homes that are all in a similar price range. You don’t have to apply for cover for every job or remember to extend it if delayed.
They’re not recommended, though, if you do mainly alterations and renovations. This is because of potential complications when existing structures are involved.
Annual policies come with a maximum contract value. This means all contracts below this amount are automatically covered. However, any jobs that exceed this amount will have no cover at all. For those you’ll need to arrange a separate policy.
11. Are my tools and equipment on site covered?
Generally no, unless an extension is  applied for to cover these items. Subcontractors’ tools are generally not covered.
12. What happens if I stop work on the job but it’s not finished?
Most policies exclude cover for any loss or damage caused by or connected to cessation of work at the site. So, if you’re building your own place in stages, or have a bust up with the owner and walk off site, or get injured and can’t work, or if any other delay results in you not being able to continue work on site for a period of time, the policy may not cover any damage or loss that occurs as a result.
The interpretation of whether work has ceased, and whether the damage or loss is connected to it or caused by it (directly or indirectly), is down to your insurer. Different insurers have different wording around cessation of work – so if it’s likely that your project will be interrupted by periods where no work is going on, speak to your insurer about how it may affect your cover.
In a nutshell
Contract works insurance needs to be in place for any building work. If it’s your responsibility, make sure you do it and that it includes everything that needs to be covered and is for the right amounts and the right length of time. If you’re unsure of anything, speak to your insurance adviser.

As a result of the recent Kaikoura earthquake, aftershocks and a heightened risk of more seismic activity, New Zealand’s major insurers have created a ‘restriction zone’, within which there are significant limitations on the availability of new insurance. It’s important you understand how this could affect your business
The creation of these zones is largely due to international reinsurers imposing restrictions on the local insurance market.
At the time of writing, the zones and the limitations imposed vary by insurer, but broadly cover a region from Wairarapa to North Canterbury and everything in between. Christchurch, areas of mid-Canterbury and the West Coast are restricted by some limitations, but not others.
These restrictions may make it very difficult, if not impossible, for some people to arrange insurance for new construction work in the restriction zone, or to increase their sum insured.
They also apply to other classes of asset insurance, such as house and contents, tools and equipment. The restrictions may also have a flow-on effect on areas outside this zone, with additional information required and conditions imposed. Non-asset insurance such as liability and indemnity, life, medical and income protection are not affected.
Motor vehicle cover is available, subject to some additional information. Some insurers will arrange new cover for existing customers, again with conditions.
Contract works insurance
After the Christchurch earthquakes, a number of issues with contract works insurance arose that are worth highlighting again.
Heavy demand for demolition and removal services following the Christchurch quakes caused a sharp spike in the cost of these services. Contract works insurance typically includes an allowance for these costs, but the default values in standard building contracts were not enough after an area-wide event like an earthquake. Make sure you allow enough in both your contract and insurance to cover these costs.
How is the natural disaster excess calculated?
Insurers have different formulas for working out the claim excess after a natural disaster.
It could be a percentage of the cost of the actual damage, or a percentage of the work completed when the claim occurs and it could even be a percentage of the total contract price! Your policy will describe the formula that applies to you.
Who pays the excess?
After the Christchurch quakes, it was impossible to secure contract works cover for a period of time. The first insurers to enter the market imposed hefty excesses for natural disaster claims, which placed substantial risk back on the contracting parties.
Your building contract should specify who is responsible for paying the excess if a natural disaster insurance claim needs to be made. In general, this should not be the builder’s responsibility, but your contract needs to be clear on this point.
The cost of the recent quakes, plus a heightened risk of damage from future aftershocks, means some types of insurance could be unavailable or restricted for some time.
You also need to consider whether the cover in your policy is adequate and your contract protects you properly.

TITLE   : BACKED BY A BOND

A Covid-19 related policy change earlier this year saw Kainga Ora begin to accept surety-backed bonds rather than only those that are bank-backed. This has great benefits for contractors and accelerates a trend seen across the market towards bonds rather than retentions.
If you tender for a decent-sized contract, the chances are it will require retentions. Avoid this if you can! A bond is a safe, cost-effective alternative.
Retentions are a way for the head contractor or principal to ensure sub-contractors will return to fix defects. They keep a portion of your money and only release it once the defects period ends. In some cases, this could be years after you have finished your work! Retention bonds are increasing in popularity as an alternative.
What is a bond?
A bond is a guarantee from a third party that if a company fails to deliver on its contractual obligations, the bond provider (called a guarantor or surety) will pay instead. It reduces the risks for contracting parties, because they know that if something happens they won’t be left in the lurch.
There are three parties involved in a bond: the contractor (the bond principal), their client (the beneficiary or obligee) and the surety provider.
Are they like insurance?
They are similar in that the bond helps reduce risk if an unanticipated event happens. However, they are different because, unlike insurance, the contractor is always expected to pay back the surety if a bond is called on. An insurer won’t ask you to pay back their costs if they cover a claim under your policy. Bonds are more like a mortgage, in that they require security and you will be expected to pay it back if the bond is called on.
What kinds of bonds are there?
There are many types of bonds, from bail bonds, to house deposit bonds, to training bonds. In the world of contracting, there are five main types:
Bid bonds – these make sure a contractor puts in a serious bid. If they win the tender but pull out later, the bond can be called on to make up difference between their price and the next successful bidder.
Performance bonds – these guarantee that the contractor will perform their contract. If they fail to do so, the principal can use the bond to cover the costs of engaging a replacement contractor.
Payment bonds – these guarantee that the principal will pay the contractor. If they fail to do so, the contractor can call on the bond to get paid for their work.
Retention bonds – these replace retentions and guarantee that the contractor will return to fix defects. If they fail to do so, the principal can use the bond to get them fixed by another contractor.
Advance payment bonds – these ensure that if a contractor defaults on payment for components they have ordered the supplier or manufacturer won’t be out of pocket.
What’s involved?
If you need to provide a bond there are a few things to know:
The bond wording is usually supplied in the contract. If not, the bond surety can supply one, but it must be acceptable to all three parties.
You need to be pre-approved by the bond surety. They want to make sure that the company they are providing bonds on behalf of is a good risk. Among other things, this involves an assessment of the company’s financial solvency and equity, experience andcompany structure, previous contracts and bonds issued. Once approved, you can apply for bonds as required.
You will need to provide some form of security for the bond. This is just the same as when you take out a loan or open a credit account with a merchant. The security is typically in the form of a corporate indemnity and/or personal guarantee from the directors. It could also be a charge over physical assets such as buildings or vehicles.
I have my bond, now what?
Simple, you supply it to your customer. If they need to call on it for any reason, they will do so directly with the bond surety. If they don’t need to use it, the bond will expire on the date shown.
On demand or conditional?
Bonds work in two different ways:
With an on-demand bond, the surety will pay up, usually within 48 hours, with no proof of default required. They will seek recovery from the principal later.
With a conditional bond, the default must be proved before the surety will release the funds. For example, the engineer to the works certifying a default, even to the extent of an arbitration or court judgement being needed first.
What are the benefits?
If you can supply a bond, it shows potential customers that you have been assessed as a good risk and have your sh*t together. It says you must be a substantial player with a good financial base and organisation for a bond surety to be prepared to work with you. A good surety-principal relationship is a partnership, with the surety providing support and expertise (and another set of financial eyes) to help their client maintain a financially healthy business.
If you are the beneficiary of a bond, it means you have additional financial security that you can call on if there is a problem.
If you provide a bond in lieu of retentions, it means your money isn’t at risk in the principal/head contractor’s bank account rather than your own. It improves cashflow too, as you can use that money rather than having to wait for it to be released some time down the track.
If you provide a surety bond rather than a bank bond, you are also freeing up cash, as a surety bond can be backed by other forms of security, rather than having to reserve cash in an account or paying interest on an overdraft you can’t use.
In a nutshell
Well established overseas, bonds are increasing in popularity in New Zealand, and this is true for small contracts as well as big ones. Bonds provide additional security to all parties to a construction contract, as they can reduce the risk of one party failing to meet their obligations to another. With a little bit of effort, any well-performing contractor can get access to bonds.
Partnering with a bond surety is a good way to signal to potential clients that your business is financially secure, operates professionally and that you will be a reliable partner for the contract.

What’s your liability if you estimate the rebuild value of a house for insurance purposes?
Using your knowledge as a builder to provide rebuild valuations for insurance purposes might seem like a straightforward favour for friends and family, or even an easy way to make some extra cash, but beware your liability in doing so!
For many years now, most houses have been insured for their replacement costs, based on their size in square metres. Insurers agreed to replace homes to the same size, regardless of how much it cost.
As a result of the Canterbury earthquakes, insurance companies are changing the way they insure homes. They found that the rate per square metre varies enormously and their models were incorrect. They are now going back to how it was done here 20 years ago, and the way it is done everywhere else in the world, by using a replacement sum insured .
This means homeowners need to work out the replacement cost of their own home or rental this year when their insurance is due. This total sum doesn’t only take into account the cost of building your home, but all costs associated with actually replacing it.
“As a result of the Canterbury earthquakes, insurance companies are changing the way the insure homes
Insurers have provided online ‘calculators’, which theoretically will calculate the cost to replace your home, and will be asking a lot of questions about the home’s components, such as:
Construction standard (average, quality, prestige).
Construction material (timber, steel frame, block, brick).
Roof (metal, tiles, slate).
Slope of land.
Area of home.
Garaging.
Carports.
Verandas.
Heating/air conditioning (gas, electric radiators, heat pump, ducted, warm water).
Ceiling height.
Decks.
Sheds.
Pools.
Fencing.
Paving.
Retaining.
Driveways.
The cost of demolition, professional fees and the particular terms of your policy (such as whether it includes or excludes GST) also need to be considered.
The ‘sum insured’ that homeowners select will be the maximum that insurers will pay if the home needs to be replaced. If the home is insured for more than it costs to replace it, the insurer is only obliged to pay the cost to rebuild the home as it was.
“Check the terms of your liabilty insurance to see what’s covered and what’s not!
This is the tricky bit; customers, friends, family or neighbours may ask you to tell them, or help them work out, a replacement cost. Be very careful! If the sum insured you suggest is not enough, and there’s a total loss (for example a fire), then you could be held liable for the difference.
We have already started fielding enquiries from builders asking whether they can get insurance for giving insurance replacement cost valuations. The short answer is no. If you start doing this, you do so at your own risk! We highly recommend that you check the terms of your liability insurance to see what’s covered and what’s not in regard to professional advice.

Insurance expert Ben Rickard shares insights on mental wellbeing from a business risk and insurance perspective
T here are two sides to the mental wellbeing coin for business owners. That of their workers and that of themselves. Looking after both is equally important!
Business owner wellbeing
S tress is a key cause of poor mental health for business owners. Ultimately, much of this this is driven by uncertainty, or the potential for unexpected future events to disrupt the smooth operation of the business. For example, delays with a project or clients failing to pay their bills. If these events can be avoided, or if not avoided at least have contingency plans in place, a lot of this stress can be alleviated. T hat’s why we advocate for businesses, large and small, to have an appropriately scaled risk management and business continuity plan in place.
This is a proactive approach to thinking about all the potential risks, by first identifying and prioritising them, then documenting the treatment plan. It involves working out how to minimise the chance of these unexpected events, then how to deal with them in the most efficient and cost-effective way if they do come up.
H aving the right insurance is part of this plan, but so are many other things, like having good credit control processes and systems, back-up plans if things go wrong, well trained staff, a good accountant, a lawyer and business adviser on your side, proper contracts, payment claims and more.
Worker wellbeing
I f staff are not happy this can lead to wider problems. Prevention is critical but let’s assume that the sh*t has hit the fan and a worker has taken a grievance against the business.
They allege bullying, harassment and the poor environment on site leading to stress and mental health issues. They may also claim to not be able to work as a result and need to go on ACC.
The first point is that ACC doesn’t cover mental health claims in many common work scenarios.
According to their own guidelines, among other things ACC “…cannot provide cover for mental injuries caused by stress or other gradual processes at work…”
If that’s the case, it leaves the business open to a claim by the worker for compensation for any lost income or other uninsured treatment costs. This is where your Employer’s Liability insurance comes into play. This covers your liability for accident or injury to staff that is not otherwise covered by ACC, such as mental health.
T here is a second type of policy, called Employment Disputes Liability, which will pay the legal defence costs and compensation (if awarded) in the event of a dispute going in front of the Employment Relations Authority.
The average claim cost in these scenarios is around $17,000 and they are becoming more common.
In a nutshell
T hings go wrong – that’s life and that’s business. Having a plan can ensure that these unforeseen events are minimised and dealt with efficiently, reducing stress and improving business owner wellbeing.
If workers are suffering, this can also have blowback on the business — and if this happens, there is insurance available to protect you from potentially significant financial costs.

Tool theft is rife around the country and, even if you haven’t been personally affected, you’ll likely know someone who has. We’re urging builders to take extra precautions on site and lock all tools securely
Without tools, it would be impossible to do your job, so it makes great sense to insure them. Police are urging builders, project managers and contractors to be vigilant and take steps to reduce the opportunity for offenders to target construction sites.
How bad is it?
Below is a brief summary of incidents from across the country:
Auckland
Police arrested a prolific offender after carrying out a search; they seized a large amount of suspicious property, including several thousand dollars’ worth of trade and electrical tools.
Coromandel
In Whitianga, $25,000 worth of tools and plumbing gear was stolen off site. A man was arrested and found with two drop saws, including one with a diamond cutting blade.
Waikato
Fourteen toilets were stolen from a site in Hamilton East, along with thousands of dollars worth of tools from developments in Horotiu and Te Rapa. Thieves also stole a Nissan Navara, a trailer and $10,000 worth of tools from Hamilton developments.
Hawke’s Bay
More than $100,000 worth of stolen building materials, tools and equipment was recovered in Hastings in August last year. Police said the haul included circular saws, nail guns, timber, a set of windows, bags of plaster, scaffolding, electrical wires, dive tanks – and an entire kitchen!
Wellington
Police are warning contractors and tradesmen to secure valuable tools and equipment, as construction sites and work vehicles have become increasingly popular targets for thieves.
Christchurch
In February, a 24-year-old painter told police he carried out the theft of goods worth thousands of dollars from parked cars in Halswell driveways and that he targeted power tools by breaking into tradesmen’s vehicles.
Otago
A bricklayer in Cromwell lost $6,500 worth of tools last year when the house he was working on was broken into. In April, a trailer, tools and a generator were taken in separate incidents in Dunedin.
How can I prevent it?
Site security is essential. Fencing acts as a deterrent, but good locks are important too. Police advise that valuable tools and equipment shouldn’t be left in unattended vehicles that aren’t kept in secure premises overnight and during the weekend.
This same principle extends to construction sites, where owners and contractors are encouraged to assess the risks of leaving valuable equipment and tools at vulnerable sites. At a minimum, make sure keys are removed and vehicles locked.
Where possible, vehicles that contain tools should be alarmed and parked in garages or away from the road. If you have a container on site where you store tools, this should be fitted with a heavyduty lockbox-style steel cover to prevent the padlock being cut. Portable alarms are also recommended for onsite storage containers.
Police recommend people record the serial numbers of their tools or mark them with identifying information, such as an LBP number, to aid the recovery and prosecution process.
Keep your asset register up to date
To make a claim under a tools and equipment policy (also known as a mobile assets policy), you need to prove your loss. Make sure you have an up-to-date tools/asset register that includes:
Item description, including model number.
Serial number.
Date of purchase.
Purchase price.
It is also a good idea to keep invoices and photos of your equipment.
Only you’re covered
Under the above policies, only tools owned by the insured entity are covered. It does not cover tools owned by subcontractors on a site, and they should insure their own.
Employees may have cover under their own contents insurance (if it includes an extension for tools used for paid work/business/commercial use, rather than just for private/home use, and the amount of cover is sufficient) or, in some cases, under the terms of employment contracts or contract works policies (with restrictions).
If you employ staff and contractors, make sure they understand this. If you are an employee, check your contract and/or contents policy to find out.
Theft of or damage to trailers
These should be insured as commercial vehicles; they can’t be insured under a tools policy.
Indemnity/market value vs replacement value cover
Indemnity or market value polices will only pay what the tool is worth when the claim is made; you have to make up the difference to buy a new one.
Replacement value cover will replace any item (that can’t be repaired) for new, regardless of its age or condition. The sum insured must be the replacement value of your tools. Beware, some policies that claim to be for replacement value will revert to market value on items more than a few years old, so check the fine print.
Theft in the open air vs forced entry (burglary)
Tools and mobile assets policies make a distinction between theft and burglary. Theft is generally considered to be when an item is stolen “in the open air” – that is without any sign of forced entry.
It would be considered theft if tools were stolen from an unlocked van, but burglary if locked doors were forced to gain entry. The same applies to tools stolen from site or other types of storage. Some policies may include burglary, but not theft in the open air.
Excesses
Even if your policy does include theft in the open air, the excess can differ. It’s common to see a $1,000 excess for burglary, but $2,500 for theft. You can find policies with options for lower burglary excesses and specialist insurers such as Builtin also offer a $1,000 excess for theft.
Having your tools stolen can be a massive inconvenience, causing delays and costing money. Taking preventative measures, keeping good records and having the right insurance cover will ensure that if something does happen, you can be back to work quickly and not out of pocket.

It’s common for building companies to engage labour-only contractors instead of taking on employees. This approach has many advantages, such as cost efficiency and flexibility, admin and tax simplicity, and reduced employment-related legal obligations. However, it also comes with liability and insurance considerations, as insurance expert Ben Rickard explains
For individuals, there can be advantages to switching from being an employee to becoming a contractor and setting up their own company. These include charging higher rates, deducting expenses and claiming GST credits. However, there are also downsides that need to be carefully considered and may not be well understood. Aside from the loss of employment protections and job security, there is also an increased administrative burden and obligations that bring liability and risk.
Accidents and illness
As a separate legal entity (whether you’re a sole trader or have set up a company), you’ll be responsible for paying ACC levies. If you’re injured and can’t work, ACC will assess your income to determine what compensation you’re entitled to. If you’ve configured your business so that your income is artificially low, perhaps by splitting it with your partner for tax reasons, or your invoiced income was patchy over the previous year, that will affect the amount ACC pays out, which may not be enough to survive on.
Solution: Contractors can switch to ACC Cover Plus Extra, which enables you to set an income level on which your compensation will be based if it is ever needed.
As a contractor, if you get sick but the illness isn’t covered by ACC (since it only covers accidents), then you may lose all your income while off work.
Solution: Contractors should consider income protection insurance, which covers loss of income if the insured person gets sick.
Liability for damage and defects
As a separate legal entity, you’re liable for any damage you cause and can be caught up in claims of defective work. Main contractors may be more willing to ‘pass the buck’ to their contractors for mistakes or damage compared to when the error is made by an employee.
Solution: Some public/general liability policies have an extension that covers labour-only contractors in certain conditions. So, if your main contractor has this cover, it can protect you as if you were an employee. However, it won’t cover you outside of your work for that main contractor. In general any separate legal entity should consider having its own public/ general liability coverage that includes cover for defective workmanship.
PCBU health and safety obligations
As an independent contractor, you become a Person Conducting a Business or Undertaking (PCBU) for the purposes of the Health & Safety At Work Act. This means you have health and safety obligations and can be prosecuted and fined if you fail to meet these. If there is a serious accident on site, WorkSafe will investigate and can include multiple PCBUs in a prosecution.
Statutory liability insurance covers legal defence costs and reparations in the event of a WorkSafe prosecution (it can’t legally cover the fine). However, independent contractors aren’t covered by their main contractor’s statutory liability insurance, even if they work exclusively for that builder on a labour-only basis. This leaves them exposed to significant financial burden if they are included in any prosecution.
The same exposure relates to other breaches of legislation, such as the Building Act, Fair Trading Act and Resource Management Act.
Solution: Labour-only contractors need to either obtain their own statutory liability insurance (usually packaged together with public/ general liability) or request that they are specifically added to their main contractor’s policy as a named insured.
Limited liability company legal protection
Operating as a limited liability company does provide significant legal protection for contractors by separating personal and business assets and limiting personal liability for business debts and obligations. However, this protection is not absolute. Contractors must adhere to their duties as directors and comply with relevant laws. For example, directors can be personally liable for company debts if the company was trading while insolvent. And they can be personally liable for breaching their duties under health and safety legislation. In some cases, usually serious misconduct such as fraud or beaches of statutory duty, courts may ‘pierce the corporate veil’ and hold directors personally liable.
While a limited liability company typically shields its directors from personal liability for contractual obligations, this protection does not extend to tortious acts, such as negligence. If a builder personally engages in negligent construction work, they can be held personally liable for any resulting harm or damage, even though it was their limited liability company that was contracted to do the work.
Solution: Builders, who are both directors of their own company and involved in the physical work, need to be aware that they can be held personally liable for negligence or for breaches of statutory duties. The fact that the work was performed under the umbrella of a limited liability company does not absolve them from personal responsibility for the quality and safety of their work.
Given these risks, it is crucial for builders operating through a company to carry adequate liability insurance that covers both the company and the individual. This can provide financial protection in the event of claims of negligence.
Builders should also be mindful of how contracts are structured, ensuring that any personal obligations or responsibilities are clearly defined, and limitations of liability included where possible. However, even with protective clauses, the courts may still impose personal liability if negligence or direct personal involvement in defective work is established.
In a nutshell
While there are advantages for individuals to contract on a labour- only basis to a main contractor, there are also risks. These include the effect on income in the event of accident or illness; increased liability for damage and defective work; greater health and safety duties, and continued personal liability
for negligent acts. Ensuring you fully understand these (and other) risks and have taken appropriate measures to mitigate them is an important aspect of setting yourself up as a labour-only contractor.

Settling an insurance claim swiftly and easily is in everyone’s best interests, but isn’t always possible – here are some tips to help you come claim time
Service, policy coverage and price are important factors for most people when choosing an insurance provider, but making a claim is when the rubber really hits the road. In our experience, most insurers genuinely want to settle claims fairly according to their policy terms, and the vast majority are. However, dissatisfaction can arise when:
A claim is particularly complicated, such as in an unusual situation where the process can take time and cover may come down to interpretation. This happens more frequently with liability claims.
The client has misunderstood the extent of their cover because they have not read the policy or have assumed cover that is not provided.
There is poor communication during the claim handling process.
Below are some tips to help ensure your claim is settled as swiftly and satisfactorily as possible.
All claims
Read and understand your policy – what it covers and what it doesn’t.
Notify your insurer of a potential claim immediately.
Complete and return the claim form quickly and in full.
Don’t admit liability (even if it may seem obvious). Your policy says you must not do this, as it may jeopardise your insurer’s ability to defend a claim. Doing so could result in your claim being declined.
Commercial vehicle claims
Get your sum insured as accurate as possible when you take out or renew the policy. This includes the value of signwriting and other accessories.
Most policies insure the vehicle for its market value, so getting this right means you’re paying the right premium and will avoid arguments and delays over this at claim time.
If stolen or broken into:
You’ll need a police report.
If involved in an accident:
Get a photo of the other driver with their vehicle. Your insurer will try to recover your excess from the other party if they were at fault. Photographic evidence will help ensure they can’t wriggle out of it (this is happening more and more).
Take your vehicle to a repairer approved by your insurer. This is not required, but may make the claim process easier.
If it’s a windscreen:
Take it to an approved windscreen repair/replace company. You may want to ring ahead with the vehicle’s VIN number to ensure they have the right replacement part in stock.
Give them your policy number.
There is usually no excess or claim form required.
Tools claims
Insure the full value of all your tools, not just the proportion of the total that may be in your van or out on site. Doing so could mean your insurer only pays an equivalent portion of any claim.
If stolen, you will need:
A police report.
A quote to replace the stolen items.
Evidence of ownership of the items, ideally an asset register.
An asset register should contain an item description, when and where it was purchased, cost and a serial number.
There are a number of tools available to help you create and keep this up to date, including phone apps, spreadsheets and the Police’s online asset list snap.org.nz.
Receipts are another way to prove ownership, as are photos.
If damaged, you will need:
A repair quote, or if it can’t be repaired confirmation of that and a quote to replace it
Liability
A liability policy is not about refunding your costs, it is about reimbursing other parties for their losses that you’re responsible for. Bear this in mind if you’re tempted to repair or pay for things yourself before involving your insurer.
These claims can be, and often are, complicated and consequently take time to sort out. If your client has damaged (or lost) property they are advised to make a claim on their house and/or contents insurance, as this is likely to be settled more quickly.
Their insurer will then seek to recover their costs, including their client’s excess, from you. Cooperate fully and promptly with an assessor if one is appointed, as no decision will be made before their report is completed and reviewed by the insurer.
Include with your claim form:
Written correspondence from the other party – often referred to as the ‘third party’ – holding you liable for their loss. This is the key to a liability claim.
Quotes/estimates of the cost to repair the damage/reimburse the loss.
Photos and/or other evidence of the event, such as witness statements, expert reports etc.
There is never any guarantee that an individual claim will be accepted, because there are so many unique factors involved. However, by following these tips you will at least improve the likelihood of a swift and satisfactory outcome should you need to make one.

Incorporating features and materials to improve a building’s green credentials is becoming increasingly common. But who’s responsible if the finished structure doesn’t meet the original targets for sustainability? Builtin Construction Risk Expert Ben Rickard investigates
Responsibility can vary based on several factors, including contractual obligations, the roles and actions of the parties involved, and regulatory requirements. Some examples of where responsibility may fall are outlined below.
Architects and designers
These are responsible for the design of the building, including specifying sustainable materials and systems. If the design is inherently flawed, or does not adequately account for sustainability requirements, the designers could be held liable.
Engineering consultants
Engineers could be liable if their structural, mechanical, or electrical systems designs do not perform to sustainability standards, or if their systems integration recommendations are flawed.
Material suppliers
Suppliers might be responsible if they provide materials that are substandard, or do not meet the sustainability claims specified. This could be seen as a breach of warranty or misrepresentation.
Builders and contractors
If builders or contractors deviate from the specified materials or methods without approval, or if poor workmanship leads to sustainability targets not being met, they could be held responsible. This could be through direct legal action for breach of contract or negligence.
Third-party certifiers
In some cases, third-party certifiers, who assess and certify the sustainability of a building, could also be held accountable, particularly if there is an error or negligence in their evaluation processes.
Building owners or developers
In reality, the responsibility could fall on the owners or developers if they change specifications, cut costs, or make other decisions that impact the building’s sustainability outcomes.
To address these complexities, contracts often include specific clauses defining responsibilities and remedies related to sustainability targets. These contracts can also require performance bonds or other guarantees to ensure compliance with sustainability goals.
Tell me more about where the builder might get it wrong
Builders play a critical role in ensuring that a building meets its sustainability targets. There are several areas where builders might inadvertently or deliberately fail to meet these standards, leading to significant discrepancies between the design intentions and the final outcome. Here are some common areas where builders might get it wrong:
1. Substitution of materials
As touched on earlier, one of the most common issues is the use of materials that are cheaper and of lower quality than those specified in the design. These substitutions can significantly impact the building’s energy efficiency, durability, and overall environmental footprint.
2. Improper installation
Even if the correct materials are used, poor installation can compromise the building’s performance. For example, inadequate insulation installation can lead to gaps and significant heat losses, undermining energy efficiency goals.
3. Lack of understanding or training
Sustainability features often require specific knowledge or skills for proper installation. Builders lacking expertise in green building techniques may inadvertently compromise the sustainability features, such as installing energy-efficient systems incorrectly, or failing to properly seal the building envelope.
4. Non-compliance with sustainable building practices
This can include failing to implement water-saving measures, improper waste management during construction, or not following sustainable site management practices. These practices are essential to reduce the environmental impact during the construction phase.
5. Cost cutting
To stay within budget or increase profitability, builders might be tempted to make changes in ways that compromise the building’s sustainability. This could involve reducing the quality or quantity of materials and resources used in construction.
6. Communication failures
Miscommunication between architects, engineers, contractors, and subcontractors can lead to mistakes in the construction process. This includes misunderstanding specifications or the improper execution of detailed designs.
To mitigate these risks, building contracts should include detailed specifications and require rigorous compliance checks, including third-party inspections and testing. Additionally, promoting better education and training for builders on sustainable practices, along with a strong emphasis on quality assurance and control, can help ensure that the sustainability goals of a building are met effectively.
If the builder does get it wrong, where could they be liable?
Using the example of substituting materials, several liability issues could potentially arise:
1. Breach of contract
If the contract explicitly specifies the use of certain sustainable materials, the builder’s substitution without approval can constitute a breach of contract. The building owner could potentially sue for damages resulting from non-compliance with the contractual specifications.
2. Warranty issues
Buildings often come with warranties that cover defects in materials and workmanship. Use of inferior materials can lead to early failures or defects, possibly voiding warranties and exposing the builder to claims for repair or replacement.
3. Misrepresentation and fraud
If the builder claims to have used specified sustainable materials but has actually used inferior substitutes, this could be considered fraudulent misrepresentation. The builder could face legal action for fraud and prosecution under the Fair Trading Act.
4. Regulatory and compliance violations
Legislation and regulation increasingly mandate the use of sustainable materials, particularly in government-funded or green-certified projects. Using non-compliant materials could result in fines, penalties or forced project modifications.
5. Reputational damage
Both the designer and builder could suffer reputational damage. The designer’s vision for a sustainable project is compromised and the builder could be seen as unreliable, potentially impacting future business opportunities.
6. Environmental impact
The substitution could have environmental consequences, defeating the purpose of the original sustainable design and potentially leading to liability issues if the building fails to meet certain environmental standards or certifications like Green Star.
7. Financial impact on the building owner
The use of non-specified materials can affect the building’s operational costs, sustainability performance and property value. The owner might incur higher costs over time due to increased energy consumption, reduced efficiency, or more frequent repairs. The builder could be held liable for these increased costs.
In a nutshell
In many ways, building to a more sustainable specification is no different than following any other design. However, the accumulation of energy efficiency and other sustainable outcomes for the completed structure does increase the potential for inadvertent breaches of contract (and other issues), opening up more areas of liability for those involved in the process.
Green Star is a tool that awards points across various key performance and environmental categories to assess a project’s sustainability rating. If a build you’re working on is designed to achieve a specific rating and you compromise that, you could be held liable

TITLE   : Reduce your risk of tool theft

Tools are expensive – and that makes them an attractive target for thieves. Insurance expert Ben Rickard is here to discuss how you can reduce the risk of theft
T ool theft is increasingly common and, if it hasn’t happened to you yet, you’ve probably heard of it happening to someone you know. We’re urging all builders to take extra measures to secure their tools.
What can you do?
Follow/choose from these simple tips and options:
1A. Prevention of theft from site
Keep items on site only when absolutely needed.
Keep tools and equipment secured in heavy-duty lockable containers when stored onsite. Check out armorgard.co.nz for some good options.
Don’t leave tools in the open, where they have a higher chance of tempting opportunist thieves.
Mark your tools in a highly visible way as a deterrent to theft.
Install motion-sensing cameras, alarms and/or lights that will notify you or a monitoring service of any activity.
1B. Prevention of theft from vehicles
Secure trailers with a towball lock and/or wheel clamp, so they can’t be stolen (with all your tools on board).
Don’t park your vehicle on the street unattended and loaded with tools (and always lock it)!
Install Armorgard-style secure drawers or boxes in your vehicle. These are a great deterrent to opportunist thieves.
Fit your vehicle with an anti-tampering alarm.
Place stickers on your vehicles, warning that power tools stored inside are marked and GPS tagged. Contact ben@builtin.co.nz for free stickers.
2. Tracking
Install GPS tracking chips
3. Replacement/Recovery
Keep a register of your tools. This will help the Police if they are recovered, as well as making an insurance claim much quicker. There are useful apps to help you do this, such as hoist.world or toolprotect.com.au , although a simple Google Sheet can do the job just as well. The information that should be recorded includes:
Tool description.
Serial number.
Date of purchase.
Cost.
Where purchased.
Record copy of receipt/ invoice.
Photo of item.
Engrave your tools with your mobile, driver’s licence or LBP number as an identifier. This is how the Police are able to connect recovered tools with their rightful owners, it can also act as a deterrent for opportunist theft in some cases.
Use tracking technology, such as SelectaDNA selectadna.co.nz .
Make sure you have good tools insurance. The key considerations are:
Replacement value cover (new for old regardless of age).
What the burglary and theft excesses are.
Is theft from vehicles covered?
Is the claim process going to be quick and easy?
Tools insurance
Premiums are not as expensive as you may think, although the current high volume of claims is putting pressure on rates. Here are our top tips to make sure you’re getting the cover you need:
If your tools are stolen, for a claim to go smoothly, you will need to provide:
A completed claim form (easy).
Police acknowledgement (easy).
Proof of ownership of the stolen items (easy, if you have done the work up front to record all this).
Quote to replace them (easy).
The biggest reason for a delayed payment for a tools claim is the time it takes for the policyholder to try and dig up proof of ownership, so if this is taken care of in advance, the process is very quick and easy.
Replacement value vs indemnity value
Replacement value cover will replace stolen items with brand new ones, regardless of their age or condition when pinched. Beware, some policies that claim to be for replacement value will revert to market value on items more than a few years old, so check the fine print. With indemnity value policies, you’ll only get what the item was worth when it was stolen (eg, its depreciated value) and you have to make up the difference.
Trailers
These should be insured as commercial vehicles; they can’t be insured under a tools policy.
Theft vs burglary
Tools policies make a distinction between theft and burglary. Theft is generally considered to be when an item is stolen “in the open air” – that is, without any sign of forced entry. So, it would be considered theft if tools were stolen from an unlocked van or site but burglary if locked doors were forced or a window smashed to gain entry. Some policies include burglary but not theft in the open air and you need to understand what you’re getting.
Cover for tools in vehicles
Some policies increasingly exclude cover for theft from a vehicle. This can be an issue, because often vehicles have to be accessed by multiple workers throughout the day, so they tend to stay open or unlocked while onsite. Builtin’s tools cover allows for this.
Know your excess
Even if your policy does include theft in the open air, theft excesses can differ. The policy might advertise a $500 excess, but it’s common to see a $1,000 excess for burglary and $2,500 for theft. You can find policies with options for lower excesses. Builtin has a $1,500 excess for theft. Builtin’s burglary and theft excess drops to $500 if an Armorgard secure storage box is installed.
In a nutshell
Having your tools stolen can be a massive inconvenience, cause delays and cost money. Taking preventative measures, keeping good records and having the right insurance cover will ensure that if something does happen, you can get back to work quickly and not be out of pocket.

On 19 April 2021, the New Zealand Government announced the opening of the trans-Tasman bubble, raising questions about how travel during Covid affects employment law, sick leave, salary and privacy
The bubble softened border control measures to allow for two-way quarantine-free travel across the Tasman for the first time since the Covid-19 pandemic began. From 17 May 2021, quarantine-free travel was also opened to the Cook Islands.
Between 19 April 2021 and 7 May 2021, there were 46,226 departures from New Zealand to Australia, indicating that Kiwis are taking up the opportunity to hop across the ditch. However, Covid-19 outbreaks in Australia have resulted in temporary suspensions of quarantine-free travel at short notice, both during that time and since then.
While celebrated, these travel bubbles have brought about a new wave of uncertainty and raised fresh Covid-19-related questions for employers and employees. We address what can and cannot be done when employees want to travel.
Do employees have to tell employers their plans?
At the centre of every employment relationship is the obligation for both employers and employees to act in good faith. Both parties must be responsive and communicative, and not mislead or deceive each other.
Under the Health and Safety at Work Act 2015 (HSWA), employees also have a duty to comply with any reasonable health and safety policy, procedure, or practice set by their employer to allow their employer to comply with the HSWA.
As such, an employer has the right to ask employees the purpose for their leave and to ask if they are travelling overseas (as they are at a greater risk of contracting Covid-19). While in most circumstances an employee should disclose their travel plans, an employee does not have to disclose personal information.
Employers need to keep in mind that any personal information collected from an employee relating to their health and Covid-19 must be kept confidential as required under the Privacy Act 2020.
Can an employer refuse an employee’s leave request?
An employer can withhold consent to an employee’s request for annual leave. However, if an employee wants to take entitled annual holidays, employers cannot unreasonably refuse this request.
The decision to refuse a leave request must be made on a case-by-case basis. For example, an employer couldn’t make a blanket rule refusing leave to all staff who wish to travel to Australia. A circumstance where an employer may reasonably restrict when anemployee can take time off is if it is a particularly busy period for the business.
An employer may also refuse an employee’s leave request if they want to take annual holidays in advance, as the employee is not yet entitled to this leave.
In the case of bubble travel, the risks associated with travel overseas may be too high for specific workplaces. This is unlikely to apply to the construction sector, but may apply if employees are required to work in close proximity, or where they interact with a vulnerable population (such as aged care facilities/populations). In most cases, these risks can be mitigated through precautions, such as requiring the employee to self-isolate for a period before returning to work.
We advise employers to discuss, in good faith, alternative working options, contingency plans and return-to-work requirements with employees requesting leave for overseas travel. We discuss this further below.
How can employers prepare when employees intend to travel overseas?
Employers should engage with their employees, in good faith, to arrange alternative working options and contingency plans prior to an employee traveling abroad. This clarifies the expectations of both parties if anything unexpected occurs and minimises the risk of a dispute in the future.
Employers should consider discussing:
Payment entitlements and work obligations if the bubble status changes and the employee is unable to return to the workplace when planned.
Remote working options, including the requirement that the employee travels with devices and equipment necessary for remote work, and ensures accommodation has an internet connection.
Whether employees returning from overseas will be required to obtain a negative Covid-19 test result before returning to work (all information surrounding the test results must be kept confidential in accordance with the Privacy Act).
If the employee contracts Covid-19, that they can take available sick leave.
Dates where agreed plans may be revised if the employee is unable to return to work for a prolonged period, for example how long their role will be kept open for them.
The obligation on both parties to consult and keep in regular contact is particularly relevant to bubble travel.
Do employers have to pay an employee if they get stuck overseas, or in managed isolation?
If an employee gets stuck overseas, or in a managed isolation facility, they may be entitled to payment. The key considerations are whether the employee is ready, willing, and able to work.
If the employee is no longer on annual leave, is well, and can carry out their work remotely, they should be paid as normal for every hour that the employee works (this must be at least the applicable minimum wage).
Where the employee is no longer on annual leave, is not sick but cannot work remotely, an employer may not be required to pay the employee for the period where they are unable to work. The employer could offer for the employee to take further annual leave, or unpaid leave to cover the period where they are unable to work. This is dependent on the specific employment agreement and further advice should be sought.
In summary
In most circumstances it would be reasonable for an employee to have to inform their employer that they are travelling overseas.
Unless it can clearly be shown that an employee’s travel would result in significant risk to the workplace, and there are no alternatives, it is unlikely that refusing bubble travel would be considered reasonable.
Employers should have open and constructive discussions with their employees prior to an employee’s travel. This should include employer expectations and employee entitlements around bubble travel.
An employee’s pay entitlements will be dependent on the specific employment agreement and circumstances.

Consider protection under these legal agreements while we wait for building supplies shortages to return to normal
There are numerous reports of construction projects being delayed due to a shortage of building supplies. This situation is likely to be a feature of the industry for the foreseeable future and clearly has a wide-reaching impact across the industry.
Alongside general supply shortages, we are also aware that some suppliers are imposing minimum volume or value requirements for orders which is limiting some areas of the market to bulk orders only. This is of particular concern for smaller contractors, who may not be in a position to place orders of sufficient volume.
In general terms, it is likely that the risk of supplier delays will fall on the contractor and will lead to the contractor being exposed for the consequences of late project delivery, including liquidated damages.
In this article, we discuss some ways for both contractors and principals to mitigate supply issues. By “principal” we are referring to the client or the client’s agent, such as a project manager or head contractor (in which case, “contractors” refers to sub-contractors).
Costly impact of shortages
At a commercial level, we see contractors stockpiling materials, pooling together to order in bulk, and sourcing alternative products. This may become increasingly difficult as resources become scarce.
There are various contractual provisions which come into play when supply issues are being experienced, including:
Cost fluctuations.
Grounds for delay.
Offsite materials.
Substitution of materials.
Variations.
In addition to contractual considerations and principal approval, it may also be necessary to get the approval of the consenting authority for a change of materials to ensure compliance with building consents and the building code, which causes further cost and delay.
Extension of time
Usually there is no specific right for a contractor to claim an extension of time under its construction contract for supply chain delays. In the absence of a specific provision covering this issue, a contractor is likely to be left with seeking to rely on the common extension of time ground of “circumstances not reasonably foreseeable by an experienced contractor at the time of tendering and not due to the fault of the contractor” (10.3.1(f) NZS 3910:2013 ).
It then becomes necessary to analyse whether or not supply chain issues were reasonably foreseeable at the time of tendering. Given supply-chain issues are now wide-ranging and have been reported on for some time (eg, Covid-19-related issues were predicted and commented on as far back as when Covid-19 began to emerge and the delays at Ports of Auckland have been reported on since November 2020), it may be very difficult for contractors who tendered post-Covid to be able to successfully argue an extension of time claim under 10.3.1(f).
It is therefore vital for contractors to consider current and potential future supply delays when agreeing a programme for a project to mitigate the risk of late delivery. Contractors should check current contracts to see whether they have supply related delay clauses they can rely on. For future projects, contractors should consider the inclusion of a specific provision (tag) to cover this risk.
Offsite materials agreement
We are seeing a sharp increase in the use of off-site materials agreements so that contractors can try and source as many materials as possible for a project at the earliest opportunity. This is being done partly due to fear of not being able to source materials in the future when they will be required for a project, but also to mitigate against increasing costs.
This can be beneficial to both contractors and principals and is a solution for keeping projects on schedule. However, principals will be exposed to paying for materials earlier than they intended and significantly ahead of the materials being incorporated into a build. Accordingly, it will be dependent on principals having the ability to fund this up-front payment and being prepared to take on this risk. Contractors may not have the cashflow for large stockpiles of materials, particularly where they are working on multiple projects.
To mitigate the risk to principals, the title in those materials should pass on payment and the materials should be clearly labelled as belonging to the principal. The principal can, and should, protect their interest by registering a security interest on the Personal Properties Security Register (PPSR).

Duncan Cotterill partner Alysha Hinton looks at a recent Supreme Court decision that sets a new precedent for including third parties in civil offence proceedings, even if more than ten years have passed since building work occurred
The Supreme Court has just released a decision, Beca Carter Hollings and Ferner Limited v Wellington City Council [2024] NZSC 117, resolving the longstanding question of which of the Building Act longstop or the contribution provisions of the Limitation Act takes precedence. This is a significant issue in construction litigation because of the potential for building defects to be discovered a long time after construction.
Case Summary
WCC was being sued for negligence in granting a building consent, inspecting the work and issuing a Code of Compliance Certificate for a building constructed on land owned by CentrePort Ltd (CentrePort) at Waterloo Quay, Wellington (the building).
Construction of the building was commissioned by BNZ and designed to meet BNZ’s requirements – eg, those as to size and layout – and was constructed over the period between 2006–2010. BNZ leased the premises from CentrePort around February 2011.
As a result of the Kaikōura earthquake in November 2016, the building was irreparably damaged and BNZ was not able to return to the building, which was treated as uneconomic to repair and deconstructed.
BNZ filed its proceedings against WCC on 2 August 2019. Its claim focused on negligence in the design of the building’s substructure and superstructure. Damages of around $101 million were sought for various losses, including those resulting from business interruption and from property damage caused by the impact of the earthquake on the building. WCC denied liability in negligence and plead various limitation defences.
On 26 September 2019, WCC filed a statement of claim against Beca and one other third party. It was pleaded that Beca had responsibility for the provision of engineering design and construction of the building. As such, if WCC was found liable to BNZ, it claimed contribution under section 17(1)(c) of the Law Reform Act 1936 and in equity from Beca as a joint tortfeasor (an individual or entity that has been found to have committed a civil offence that injures another party) with WCC.
Beca accepted it was engaged by CentrePort to, among other matters, undertake design work and monitor construction. However, it denied liability for various reasons – most significantly the protection of the tenyear longstop in section 393(2) of the Building Act 2004.
Unprecedented Interpretation of Longstop
Until 2021, cases had consistently held that the ten-year longstop under section 393(2) of the Building Act applied to claims for contribution under section 17 of the Law Reform parties could not be joined to the proceedings beyond the ten-year period.
The High Court in this case declined to follow this line of authority. The Court decided that section 393 applied only to claims by building owners, while claims by defendants for contribution against other tortfeasors are governed by the Limitation Act 2010. The Court of Appeal upheld this decision. The Court of Appeal decided that the finality provided by the Building Act longstop is not absolute, as the cause of action for the contribution claim did not arise at the time of the building work. It instead arises when one defendant is held liable to the plaintiff. Only then can a claim for contribution for that liability arise.
By a split (3:2) decision, the Supreme Court has upheld the Court of Appeal. While accepting that the wording of section 393(2) of the Building Act – specifically “civil proceedings relating to building work” – was broad enough to capture contribution claims, the majority determined that if section 393(2) was intended to override the special regime, which existed for contribution claims, the legislation needed expressly to make that clear. As it did not do so, the majority found that the limitation period governing contribution claims in relation to building work was section 34 of the Limitation Act 2010.
This means that for building claims, third parties who are joint tortfeasors will be able to be joined to a proceeding, even if more than ten years (longstop period) have passed since the building work occurred. A claim for contribution can be brought at any time up to two years after the party seeking contribution is found liable to the plaintiff.
Insurers of parties engaged in construction work will now need to be aware that their insureds may face claims arising out of their work for a longer period than in the past. Individuals exposed to potential liability after retirement should ensure they have run-off cover for an extended period.

Death is a subject most of us prefer to avoid, but the more you plan for it while you’re alive, the less impact it will have on your business and family later
B enjamin Franklin aptly stated: ‘in this world nothing can be seen to be certain, except death and taxes’. Since you may not receive advance warning of your impending death, it is a good idea to begin planning what will happen after you die – sooner rather than later.
If you own a business, it is even more important, because it’s quite likely that a significant portion of your wealth – and possibly your family’s income source – is tied up in it.
Where there’s a will…
Dying without a will can be messy, expensive and time-consuming for those left behind. Therefore, the first step is to ensure you have an up-to-date will that accurately reflects how you wish your assets to be divided upon your death. It is an absolute minimum.
Your will should also deal with the appointment of trustees and executors, the transfer on death of personal chattels, guardianship of children, burial or cremation directions and, if there is an existing trust, the appointment of people who will continue with the power of appointment of trustees under that trust.
We often focus on the business assets, which may be owned by a company or partnership.
Your will should cover all your personal assets and liabilities, including some that are often overlooked such as:
Personal debts.
Life insurance policies.
Advances to friends, family, trusts or companies.
Property, including holiday homes.
Shares.
Cars, boats and personal items including jewellery.
Your will may be the most important document you ever sign. Make sure you have a valid will, review it regularly and take legal advice if your circumstances change.
Business succession
It’s common for business owners to want their interests in a business transferred or made available to family members after they’ve passed on. Sometimes this is desirable, but it’s not always realistic or in the best interests of the business (and therefore the family).
It’s important to establish if the intended recipient actually wants to receive the business. Even if the business is successful and a son or daughter is interested, care is needed. A common problem is that a business is left to someone and the business represents the major asset of real value.
This creates problems if there are other siblings or relatives who are effectively disinherited. Major rifts may arise. If you personally own the business (or shares in a holding company), there may be family protection claims, which can divide a family.
One possibility for dealing with this is for the business to be owned by a company and the shares in that company owned through a trust. Shares can then be transferred or sold to family while you’re alive, so that on your death the ‘successor’ is already a significant shareholder in the company.
While this structure may not prevent difficulties between family members, it can be used to minimise the risk of litigation. If the shares are owned by a trust with a sound structure, it will be more difficult for a disgruntled family member to attack.
If minimising family disharmony is important – and in most cases it is – one option is for a cash payment or a life insurance policy to be taken out, to make some provision for the family members who will not benefit from the business.
Time to trust
Trusts provide advantages in terms of confidentiality, protection of assets against creditors and greater freedom for distribution of assets. For business owners, the protection trusts afford against creditors is a real and viable benefit.
In recent times, some of the traditional advantages of trusts have been eroded (such as enhancing your eligibility for rest home care subsidies and tax advantages).
However, you can still use a trust for effective succession planning. A trust is still the most effective mechanism to ensure the transfer of assets to family members is undertaken in a controlled and secure manner.
Your will and trust should be supported with a memorandum of wishes providing an informal direction from you, as the settlor of the trust, to help the trustees make decisions and take into account what you would have wanted to happen. While not a legally binding document, it’s a good way to ensure trustees are able to take your wishes into account when making decisions.
Enduring powers of attorney
Consider what would happen if you’re overseas or struck down by illness – would someone be able to step into your shoes in those circumstances ?
Enduring powers of attorney are not just for older members of our community and should be completed by people of all ages as an essential part of your estate planning and common sense business practice.

The number of new homes consented in the year ended August 2024 is the lowest it’s been over the same 12-month cycle since the year ended August 2021
There were 33,632 new homes consented in the year ended August 2024, a decrease of 20.1% compared with the year ended August 2023.
“The number of multi-unit homes consented in the year ended August 2024 is the lowest in the last three years,” said Construction and Property Statistics Manager Michael Heslop.
In the year ended August 2024, there were 15,597 stand-alone houses consented (-9.7% compared the year ended August 2023) and 18,035 multi-unit homes consented (-27.4%).
Of the 18,035 multi-unit homes, there were 14,608 townhouses, flats and units (-19.6% compared with the year ended August 2023), 1,704 apartments (-55.2%) and 1,723 retirement village units (-40.3%).
“The number of apartments consented in the year ended August 2024 is the lowest in 10 years,” Heslop said.
Month-on-month reduction
The month of August 2024 saw 2,881 new homes consented compared with 3,170 in the month ended August 2023 (- 9.1%).
Of those, 1,422 were stand-alone houses, compared with 1,243 in the month of August 2023 (+14.4%).
There were 1,459 multi-unit homes consented in August 2024, compared with 1,927  in August 2023 (- 24.3%).
Of the multi-unit homes, there were 1,137 townhouses, flats and units (-23.1%), 47 apartments (-66.2%) and 275 retirement village units (-11.3%).
One regional outlier
Only one region, Otago, consented more dwellings in the year ended August 2024 compared to the previous year (2,130; +1.8%).
The four regions with the most consents issued were Auckland (13,748; -23.6%), Canterbury (6,713; -9.4%), Waikato (2,942; -26.1%) and Wellington (1,982; -39.3%).
Consents down per 1,000 residents
In terms of dwellings consented per 1,000 residents, the figures for the year ended August 2024 declined compared with the year ended August 2023 (6.3 vs 8.1).
Three regions consented above national levels: Auckland (7.9), Otago (8.4) and Canterbury (10.1)
Non-residential building consents down
In the year ended August 2024, non-residential building consents totalled $9.1bn, down 7.9% from the year ended August 2023. The building types with the highest value were:
Offices, administration and public transport buildings – $1.8bn (+26%).
Storage buildings – $1.4bn (-5.9%).
Hospitals, nursing homes, and health buildings – $1.3bn (-22%).

Simpson Grierson takes an in-depth look at the recently announced consumer protection measures and expands on builders’ new responsibilities
This article focuses on the significant changes introduced by the Building Amendment Act 2013 (Act), designed to strengthen the rights and remedies of consumers in relation to residential building work. As announced in MBIE’s article last month, these are due to come into force in January 2015. Simpson Grierson offers insight into the changes and what they mean for builders.
From 1 January 2015, new regulations come into force, which will apply to all residential building work valued at $30,000 or more. These regulations focus on the relationship between principals (homeowners) and building contractors. They aim to increase consumer awareness and protection by:
Requiring building contractors to disclose information about their qualifications and building history before entering into, and after completing work on, a residential building contract.
Creating mandatory minimum requirements for building contracts (including a requirement that contracts over $30,000 be in writing).
Imposing fines for not complying with the law and specifying remedies for breaching implied warranties.
Introducing an automatic 12-month defect repair period.
The building contractor will be obliged to give their client a checklist. This will be a generic, standard form document published by MBIE. It is intended to inform clients generally about what they should consider when entering into a contract. Details are still being finalised, but indications are that it will include:
An explanation of the legal obligations of the client and the building contractor, eg that all building work must comply with the Building Act 2004 and what type of work requires a building consent.
Advice about managing a building project and hiring competent building contractors.
An outline of the requirement for contracts to be in writing and to contain certain information, such as start and completion dates, payment processes, dispute resolution processes and how variations are to be handled.
Dispute resolution options.
Sources for further advice and information.
The building contractor will also be required to disclose certain information about themselves to the client before entering into a residential building contract if the contact price is over $30,000, or if the client requests the information.
The information that must be disclosed will be specific to each building contractor and each project. The precise detail of what information must be disclosed is still being worked out and will be published as regulations (presumably before the end of this year). However, indications are that the disclosure requirements will include:
Information about the legal status of the building contractor – is the ‘builder’ a company, a partnership or an individual?
The dispute history of the building contractor.
The skills, qualifications, and licensing status of the individuals who will be undertaking the work.
If the building contractor is a company, what is the role and business history of the directors?
There will also be requirements to disclose information about what insurance policies the building contractor holds or intends to take out, and information about any guarantees or warranties the building contractor offers in relation to the particular project.
At the end of the project, the building contractor will be required to disclose further information about:
The identity and contact details of the building contractor.
Any guarantee or insurance the building contractor obtained for the building work.
Any maintenance requirements for products involved in the building.
“It is important that building contractors take control of the contract formalities up front and produce clear, compliant written contracts
As outlined in MBIE’s article last month, from 1 January 2015 residential building contracts over $30,000 will have to:
Be in writing.
Be dated.
Comply with any other minimum requirements that the regulations prescribe.
The regulations are likely to prescribe that contracts must include certain content, categories or specific information, categories or types of terms or specific terms. These terms are likely to include:
The names and contact details of the parties.
The process to be followed if a dispute occurs.
The process for varying the contract scope.
The timeframe for performing the contract.
The payment process.
The onus is heavily on the building contractor to ensure these new requirements are met. For residential projects valued at over $30,000, the building contractor can face fines of up to $2,000 for:
Failing to disclose the required information.
Not having a written contract.
Having a contract that otherwise does not comply with the minimum requirements for contracts (for example by not including specific terms specified in the regulations).
If a building contractor knowingly makes a statement or omission that is false or misleading in a material way, they could face a fine of up to $20,000.
It is important, therefore, that building contractors take control of the contract formalities up front and produce clear, compliant written contracts. This may be completely new territory for many builders, who are used to a more informal approach!
There are already certain warranties implied into every contract for construction of a residential building. Those warranties state that all residential building work must:
Be carried out in a proper and competent manner, with reasonable skill and care.
Comply with plans, specifications, the building consent and all relevant laws.
Be undertaken using materials that are fit for purpose and new (unless the parties agree otherwise).
However, remedies for breaches of these implied warranties are new, and include:
The homeowner can require the building contractor to remedy the breach.
If the building contractor refuses to remedy the breach or does not remedy within a reasonable time (or at all), then the homeowner has the option of having the breach remedied by someone else and recovering reasonable costs and damages from the building contractor, or cancelling the contract.
If the breach (ie the defect) cannot be rectified, or if the breach is substantial, then the homeowner has the option of seeking compensation from the building contractor (for the reduction in value of the building work) or cancelling the contract.
*NOTE: Implied warranties and defect repair requirements apply to all residential building contracts, whether they’re over $30,000 or not.
Building contractors will also be required to remedy any defects that they are notified of within one year of the residential building work being completed. This requirement applies unless the building contractor can prove that the defect was caused by:
Something beyond human control.
Someone for whom the building contractor was not responsible.
Failure to carry out normal maintenance.
Failure to carry out repairs as soon as practicable after the defect became apparent.
So, as soon as an issue arises, it’s important that the building contractor investigates the problem thoroughly. The onus is on the building contractor to either fix the problem or prove they are not responsible for creating it. Proving responsibility after the fact is a notoriously difficult (and often expensive) task.
From 1 January 2015, consumers in a residential building project will receive greater protection by law, through increased awareness about their building contractors and building processes generally, and through the availability of new remedies for when defects occur.
Building contractors, who carry out residential building work valued at $30,000 or more, will be required by law to produce formal written contracts and to disclose detailed information about them and their businesses, and can face substantial fines for not complying with the new regime.

New Zealand businesses are facing unprecedented risk and financial uncertainty due to COVID-19. A significant aspect of this financial distress relates to the legal status of debts during the lockdown period – both as a creditor and a debtor
While the Government’s official advice has been to pay debts as usual, this may not be a realistic option for those businesses who rely on a consistent cash flow to remain solvent.
What immediate support is available to help with business debt?
If you are a small to medium-sized New Zealand business facing temporary financial stress due to COVID-19, you may be eligible to apply for a short-term bridging loan of up to $500,000 from your bank.
The Business Finance Guarantee scheme is being offered by the Government alongside private banks to help provide temporary financial support to businesses during this uncertain period. The Reserve Bank has reduced banks ‘core funding ratios’ from 75% to 50% to enable registered banks to make this credit available to struggling businesses.
The loans are expected to be used as urgent liquidity or bridging loans to pay operational expenses such as rent, staff, and suppliers, rather than to be used for capital investments.
While the Government will carry 80% of the credit risk for the scheme, banks are responsible for determining eligibility based on their own lending criteria, and the loans will be provided directly by banks at competitive rates. As a result, standard lending fees will apply.
To be eligible for the loan for a term of up to three years under the scheme, your business must:
Be solvent;
New Zealand based;
Have an annual turnover of between $250,000 and $80 million at the end of the 2019 financial year;
Not be engaged in an excluded activity as a material part of its business. This includes property development and property investment.
Loans will be available under the scheme until 30 September 2020. To apply for a loan, contact your bank.
For further information, please contact a member of our banking and finance team or our corporate and commercial team.

TITLE   : BUILDING CONSENT EXEMPTIONS FOR LOW-RISK WORK

Recent additions to exemptions to the Building Act have caught the eye of many builders. Alysha Hinton, from law firm Duncan Cotterill, provides a legal view on the exemptions and what they might mean for builders and homeowners
On 31 August 2020, the Government expanded the building consent exemptions in the Building Act 2004 (Act). The Act already included 43 exemptions in Schedule 1 of the Act. An additional six exemptions have been granted and the scope of four existing exemptions have been expanded.
The removal of consent requirements for low-risk building work is intended to free up the construction sector for higher value work and save property owners time and money. The new exemptions are expected to save property owners $18 million annually, and, if lodged separately, result in 9,000 fewer consents to be issued by councils per year. However, the changes are not without criticism, which we explore below.
Building consent exemptions recognise that some work is low risk enough that it shouldn’t be subject to the building consent process. Such works do not require a building consent application and, therefore, there is no review of the designs nor regular council inspections of the work while under construction.
However, there are restrictions to the exemptions:
All works must still comply with the Building Code.
The works may also need to comply with other legislative requirements, such as those under the Resource Management Act 1991, the Electricity Act 1992 and the Health and Safety at Work Act 2015.
In many cases, for the exemption to apply, a Licensed Building Practitioner ( LBP ) is required to carry out or supervise the design and construction, or the design must be carried out or reviewed by a Chartered Professional Engineer ( CPE ).
Any plumbing work to a new or current building still requires a building consent, and any electrical work will still have to be carried out by a registered electrician.
A summary of the new and expanded building exemptions can be found here: www.building.govt.nz
In short, they include:
Larger single-story detached buildings up to 30m 2 (eg, sleep outs, sheds, greenhouses, etc.).
Carports with a maximum floor area of 40m 2 .
Ground-floor awnings, verandas and porches up to 30m 2 .
Permanent outdoor fireplaces or ovens with a maximum height of 2.5m and a maximum cooking surface of 1m 2 .
Flexible water storage bladders for irrigation and firefighting only, with up to 200,000 litres in storage capacity.
Ground-mounted solar panel arrays.
Small pipe supporting structures for water only and on private land.
Short-span bridges (less than 6m) if they do not span a road or rail area.
Detached single-storey pole sheds and hay barns in rural zones with a maximum floor area of 110m 2 .
It is the property owner’s responsibility to check whether a building consent is required. However, this is often done in consultation with their building professional (the wrong advice could result in a claim of professional negligence).
If property owners are unsure whether the building work is exempt, they shave been advised to seek advice from someone with building knowledge and expertise, such as a building consent authority (typically local Council), registered architect, registered building surveyor, LBP and/or CPE. MBIE has also released guidance on all building work that doesn’t require a building consent, which can be found here: www.building.govt.nz.
Any issues relating to resource management or district plans must still be discussed with the relevant Council and a resource consent obtained, if necessary.
Allowing more building work to take place without a building consent is designed to make the works covered by the exemptions quicker and cheaper. Less consents should also free up Councils to process higher-risk consents faster.  However, along with builders, some industry experts are concerned the Government hasn’t got the balance right for New Zealand property owners.
The most controversial exemption is the increase to single-story detached buildings up to 30m 2 (previously single-storey detached buildings could not exceed 10m 2 ). This exemption includes sleep-outs and offices, but does not go as far as to include tiny homes or self-contained accommodation (eg, a granny flat), which will require bathroom and kitchen facilities that require a building consent.
The lack of public awareness on Building Code standards, and how the exemptions interplay with the LBP scheme, creates a real risk of sub-par buildings popping up all over New Zealand. While cheaper and quicker building processes will address some of New Zealand’s housing issues, it does nothing to address the overall standard of living provided by New Zealand dwellings which need to be dry, warm and safe.
There is also an increased risk that, if more work is done by non-professionals (who aren’t in the know), then more buildings will breach district plan rules, such as maximum site coverage, height-to-boundary restrictions and fire walls.
Property owners should be encouraged to engage the services of an LBP when undertaking building work. This will help address Building Code standards and provide property owners with recourse if the works breach any of the rules – this is a risk to builders as they will be the only party able to be sued for non-compliant exempt works (for consented works, Councils also face litigation risk).
A property owner could also choose to apply for a building consent if they want assurance that the work done is compliant with the Building Code and/or if they want a certified record of the compliant work on the property’s Land Information Memorandum. This is particularly useful when selling a property. Without such a record, a pre-purchase Builder’s Report becomes even more vital for proposed purchasers in order for them to know the standard, and compliance, of building work done.

Do you have a written construction contract? While it’s not yet mandatory, it’s a great way to avoid disputes by clearly setting out the rights and obligations between contractor and client. Make sure yours has the right components!
As many involved in the building industry may be aware, over the last four years, the Government has been in the process of reviewing the Building Act 2004 with the aim of reducing the costs, but not the quality, of the building control system.
“While it’s a good idea to get legal advice on any contract, it is notmandatory, and you can create your own contract to suit the way you and your clients wish to work
As part of the proposed changes, there is currently a law change before Parliament, which will make it mandatoryfor certain types of construction work to have a written construction contract. The law change is also likely to introduce new requirements that will need to be included in construction contracts.
Although the requirement to have a written construction contract is not yet mandatory, contractors may wish to take the opportunity to consider:
Whether they are currently using a written construction contract and;
Whether the written construction contract they are using clearly and adequately sets out the rights and obligations between the contractor and the principal (client) in relation to the work that will be carried out.
Having these things set out clearly in writing is good business practice and helps to minimise the chances of disputes and payment delays down the track.
There are a number of very good, and easy-to-follow, standard construction contracts available. Members of organisations such as the Registered Master Builders have access to an excellent range of written contracts that can be used as is, or adapted for specific needs.
For longer or more complex projects, the detailed standard forms (like NZS 3910 ) are best. Many builders have also developed their own bespoke contracts over the years.
Creating a contract can be inexpensive and fairly straightforward. While it is a good idea to get legal advice, it is not mandatory, and you can create your own contract to suit the way you and your clients wish to work. Broadly speaking, your contract can contain whatever terms you and your client agree upon. But here is a list of the major terms your contract should cover:
Specify who the parties to the contract are. Are you contracting as yourself, or your company?
Who is your client? Are you contracting with a company, a trust or the owners personally?
Make sure you include a date of contract. This can be important later on.
You should identify the address where the work will be done. This is particularly important if you are working on more than one site owned by that client.
It is important to specify the type of contract. For example, it could be:
A full contract, where you are responsible for all labour materials and site supervision, including supervision of your or your client’s subcontractors.
A labour-only contract.
A managed labour contract, where the client purchases materials and you carry out and supervise work, including supervision of your or the client’s subcontractors.
You need to be as clear as possible about the exact scope of the work to be done under the contract. This is particularly important, if you are not in control of the entire project.
If you are only responsible for part of the work, it is important to specify who is responsible for checking the interface between your work and the work of previous or subsequent contractors.
Consider whether you need to incorporate other documents into your written contract, such as your tender/estimate/quote, drawings and specifications, building consent conditions or other documents.
You should outline the process for how any variations to the written contract will be handled. This may mean including a requirement that variations be ordered and priced in writing and signed off by both parties.
When describing the time frame in which the work will be completed, you should include (as far as possible):
When you will start the work.
The estimated end date.
What happens if you’re late in completing the work.
What happens if others delay you.
Having appropriate insurance cover is a requirement that must be addressed before the project begins. The contract should state who is responsible for insuring the contract works and who is to be named as ‘insured’ under the Contract Works Policy.
Being clear about how the contract price is calculated is crucial. Clients hate surprises when it comes to costs!
It is also important to state when and how often payment claims can be issued. If this is not stated in writing, the fall-back position (under the Construction Contracts Act 2002) is that payment claims will be issued monthly.
A reminder about payment claims:
If you wish to take advantage of the enforcement provisions in the Construction Contracts Act 2002, your payment claims must be served on the payer and must:
Be in writing.
Contain details to identify the written construction contract to which the payment relates.
Identify the construction work and the period to which the payment relates.
Describe the claimed amount and due date for payment.
Describe how you calculated the claimed amount.
State that the payment claim is made under the Construction Contracts Act 2002.
If a payment claim is made on a residential client, it must be accompanied by a written notice describing the process for responding to the payment claim, and explain the consequences of not responding if full payment is not made by the due date. There is an online form you can use for this.
It is also important to state when payments are due. If this is not stated in writing, the fall-back position (under the Construction Contracts Act 2002) is that payments are due 20 working days after the payment claim was served. The payment section should also include whether interest is payable on late payments.
Your contract should include a defects repair period, during which you are responsible for repairing or rectifying defects that appear in the contract works.
This usually begins upon practical completion of the works and runs for a specified time frame (one, two or three months are common periods for small to medium projects).
It is important to set out an agreed method for resolving disputes, should they arise. Negotiation and mediation are commonly used dispute resolution processes. Arbitration is also commonly included in construction contracts, but this can be a very expensive and time-consuming process.
It is also very helpful to include a clause that says, even if there is a dispute, the payer cannot withhold payment from you.
We will keep you updated in relation to the proposed changes to the Building Act 2004 and the requirement to have a written construction contract in future articles. If you have any questions about these issues, or would like to discuss them in more detail, please contact Jo-Anne Knight at jo-anne.knight@simpsongrierson.com , or Andrew Tetzlaff at andrew.tetzlaff@simpsongrierson.com .

The formation of a new Government has shed light on the next steps for environmental laws and regulation within New Zealand. The Coalition Agreements (Agreements) contain notable commitments and confirm a mandate to repeal many of the environmental initiatives implemented under the previous Government. So what does that mean for builders?
To progress specific initiatives, the Government has already repealed existing legislation such as the Natural and Built Environment Act 2023 and Spatial Planning Act 2023. In the short term, reform will be achieved through amendments to the Resource Management Act 1991 (RMA), with a view to replacing the RMA in the long term.
The following ‘short-term’ list captures commitments within a 100-Day Action Plan or intended to be completed ‘as soon as practicable’. ‘Mid-term’ captures some further commitments to be progressed in the early years of coalition.
Overarching Objectives
The Agreements contain several consistent themes that clarify the purpose of pending repeals and promulgation of new legislation:
Prioritising regionally and nationally significant projects.
Enabling new infrastructure and facilitation of primary activities.
Promotion of a liberal democracy, with a focus on the enjoyment of property rights, especially with respect to interpreting the Treaty of Waitangi.
Improving cost-efficiency and reducing red tape in relation to the creation and compliance with environmental regulation.
Commitments (Short Term)
The short-term commitments are to be supported by the introduction of new legislation, such as the Regulatory Standards Act, ministerial portfolio for Regulation, and a National Infrastructure Agency. The purpose of these initiatives is to promote the principles of economic efficiency during the drafting of new legislation, and regulation as well as coordinating funding (including procurement from government agencies or private funding) for projects of regional and national significance.
The following changes to the RMA and secondary legislation processes that will impact those in the construction industry have either already been implemented or will be commenced in the short-term:
Amend the RMA to establish a fast-track consenting and permitting process for regional and national projects of significance (the Bill for this has had its first reading and is currently being reviewed by select committee).
Extension of time for councils to meet their obligations under the National Policy Statement for Freshwater Management 2020 (NPS-FM) (pending work on a replacement).
Cease implementation of new Significant Natural Areas (SNAs) and seek further advice on the operation of existing SNAs as part of the Government’s programme to reform the RMA.
Repealing the legislation supporting the Three Waters/ Affordable Water Reform, ensuring that ownership of assets to remain with councils, and beginning the implementation of a new plan for Local Water Done Well. Repeal the ban on offshore oil and gas exploration.
Make any additional Orders in Council needed to remove red tape to speed up cyclone and flood recovery efforts.
Stop the review of the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) system. The review was designed to assess if changes are needed to provide stronger incentives for businesses to transition away from fossil fuels. Ceasing the review is intended to instil confidence in the existing ETS regime and stabilise the value of New Zealand Units.
Commitments (Mid Term)
We can then expect to see further changes commenced in the mid-term, including:
To make the Medium Density Residential Standards (MDRS) optional for councils, with the need for councils to ratify any use of MDRS, including existing zones.
Amending the RMA to streamline  the plan preparation process in Schedule 1.
National’s Going for Housing Growth Policy proposes to remove LUC-3 land from the National Policy Statement – Highly Productive Land. We understand that this commitment has not been overridden by the Agreements.
We note that the commitments identified above are not intended to be an exhaustive list of all matters contained within the Agreements.

What is and isn’t ‘building work’ under the Building Act’s long-stop limitation provisions? Some recent cases have explored the answer to that question
L ong-stop limitation provisions are time limits within which legal proceedings must be initiated. The Building Act 2004 imposes a ten-year long stop on claims for defective building work. The ten years is measured from the date of the act or omission giving rise to the claim, which might be the issue of the code compliance certificate or some earlier date like practical completion.
While the limitation provisions in the Act can provide an absolute defence in court, the ten-year long stop in Section 393 of the Building Act 2004 only applies, “in relation to building work”. If a defendant believes a claim is statute barred (has exceeded the legal time limit for action) due to the ten-year long stop, they will usually apply to strike out all or part of a plaintiff’s claim against them.
Defining ‘building work’
In September 2010, Stadium Southland’s roof collapsed after a heavy snowstorm. The building owners, the Southland Indoor Leisure Centre Charitable Trust, issued proceedings against the Invercargill City Council and a consulting engineer.
The Council joined a second firm of consulting engineers who had carried out a peer review of the original design, in addition to some further redesign work. That second firm of consulting engineers (and their employees) sought to strike out the causes of action against them, relying in part on Section 393.
They argued that their work (carrying out a structural review and producing a design review letter), although related to design, was still classified as “building work” and, because this work was done more than ten years before the proceedings against them commenced, the claim was statute barred. The High Court agreed with their position. “Building work” in the 2004 Act did include “design work”.
The Court noted “building work” is defined to mean work “for, or in connection with, the construction, alteration, demolition, or removal of a building”. Further, the Act defines “construct” as including “…to design, build, erect, prefabricate, and relocate the building”.
The High Court emphasised that, in each case, what is “building work” is a fact-specific inquiry.
Therefore, where design work is specific to a particular building, it’s likely to be building work. However, if consultancy services are not directed at a particular building, the outcome may be different.
In another High Court decision, a party who carried out geotechnical reports on earthworks for a subdivision was not able to rely on the definition of “building work”. In that example, the reporting was not for, or in “connection with the construction, alteration, demolition or removal of a particular building”.
As a postscript, the Southland Indoor Leisure Centre Charitable Trust has recently succeeded in its claim against the Council.
The Council was found negligent in the exercise of its statutory duties; ie, in issuing a Code Compliance Certificate (within the ten-year long-stop provision) for the premises in circumstances where the Court found it had no information to reasonably conclude that the remedial building work* complied with the building code. The requirements of the building consent for that remedial work had never been satisfied.
*In November 1999, during construction of the stadium, excessive deflections were observed in the roof trusses that had been erected above the community courts area. Remedial works were necessary to address the deflections. A revised building consent was obtained for the revisions involved in the remedial works. The building opened in 2000.

TITLE   : DIRECTOR DUTIES

Are you a director of your own limited company? Regardless of the size of your operation, you may have more responsibilities than you realise if you trade while insolvent or don’t adhere to health and safety regulations
Whether you’re a self-employed contractor or a multi-million-dollar construction business, if you operate a limited liability company, you could be held personally liable for the losses suffered by creditors and for health and safety breaches.
THE COMPANIES ACT
It’s important to acknowledge that, as a director, you could be held personally liable if your company fails.
In February this year, the directors of Mainzeal were ordered to pay $36m for breaching their duties under section 135 of the Companies Act because Mainzeal was trading while balance sheet insolvent before it collapsed in 2013.
Do you know if your company is solvent? If it’s insolvent and you continue to trade you could be in breach of the Companies Act. If the company can’t pay its bills, creditors could seek recovery from you personally.
The building industry is chocka with small businesses, as well as individual tradesmen operating as contractors through a limited company. Regardless of the size of your operation, as a director you have a responsibility to act in the best interests of the company.
There are two sections of the Companies Act 1993 that are particularly relevant and all company directors should be well aware of them:
135 RECKLESS TRADING
A director of a company must not –
a) Agree to the business of the company being carried on in a manner likely to create a substantial risk of serious loss to the company’s creditors; or
b) Cause or allow the business of the company to be carried on in a manner likely to create a substantial risk of serious loss to the company’s creditors.
136 DUTY IN RELATION TO OBLIGATIONS
A director of a company must not agree to the company incurring an obligation unless the director believes at that time on reasonable grounds that the company will be able to perform the obligation when it is required to do so.
It may only take one client defaulting on payment, or one adverse adjudication as happened with Arrow International, and the company could be in trouble. If your company is forced into liquidation, it is a good bet the liquidator will want to know if the business had been trading while insolvent. If so, they are very likely to take a close look at the directors, with a view to recovering any debts the company owes from the directors personally.
IS YOUR BUSINESS SOLVENT?
Solvency means the company is able to pay its debts as they come due.
If the value of its assets is less than the value of its liabilities your company is insolvent.
If your business is not able to pay its creditors when the debts fall due your company is insolvent.
In either case you should not be taking on any new obligations (such as new customers or creditors) and should seek professional advice immediately. We know from experience that many building companies do operate while technically insolvent. And while this may not be a problem for the day-to-day running of the business, it does place liability upon the directors personally if the company gets into trouble.
This shows there are many reasons that could cause your company to fail, some within your control (such as having a good financial understanding and management) and some outside of it (such as poor economic conditions and payments being withheld). Either way, the old Kiwi attitude of ‘she’ll be right’ won’t cut it if you have creditors owed money and a liquidator with the legal authority to pursue you personally.
HEALTH AND SAFETY AT WORK ACT
As a company director or officer you could also be personally responsible for health & safety failures.
The Health & Safety at Work Act puts responsibility on company directors and managers to ensure that the company has, and implements, appropriate health and safety processes. Failure to do so could see the director, or any officer of the company found responsible, face prison time and/or a substantial fine.
HOW CAN YOU PROTECT YOURSELF?
This is a topic in itself and deserves more than a few bullet points. However, recognising that you don’t know it all and can’t do it all is a good start.
Ensure you have experienced professionals (who know the building industry) supporting your business, providing you with the right legal, financial, health & safety and insurance structures and advice. Set up a meeting to review your business with each of these advisers.
Make sure you have a good handle on the financial aspects of your business, so that you can see any potential issues coming. Do some financial literacy training (there are many free courses), make sure you’re using a system that provides up-to-date visibility of the company’s financial health and get frequent updates from your accountant.
Don’t put your head in the sand when it comes to your health and safety obligations. Get help from an expert to do an audit of your company’s policies and procedures.
INSURANCE TO PROTECT COMPANY DIRECTORS
It appears from media reports that a substantial portion of the $36m ordered to be paid personally by the Mainzeal directors will be covered by insurance. Known as ‘directors & officers (D&O) liability insurance’, it pays both the legal defence costs and any payment that may be ordered by the court if you are accused of failing in your duties as a director.
WHAT’S COVERED
D&O is a type of liability insurance for losses suffered as a result of the actions of a company’s board of directors and executives. Directors and officers owe a duty of care to the company’s shareholders, customers, employees and creditors. When they breach that duty of care, usually by failing to exercise reasonable care when making decisions, a D&O policy will cover the resulting damages.
D&O policies are payable to either the directors and officers themselves, or directly to the company, to indemnify the insured for the losses. This type of insurance has the potential to cover a wide variety of claims brought against a business for the actions of its directors and officers.
WHO SHOULD HAVE IT
Anyone who is a director of a company is subject to the obligations imposed under the Companies Act and the Health & Safety at Work Act.
If your company does not have its own constitution, the default provisions of the Companies Act 1993 will apply, and these default provisions prohibit the company from arranging insurance for a director or employee of the company. So, make sure your company has a constitution that expressly allows it to arrange this cover.
IN A NUTSHELL
As a director, you have a responsibility to make decisions which protect your staff and your creditors. Even if you are not directly carrying out the work, you can be held responsible for the impact your business has on others. Make sure you understand what your liability is and put measures in place to protect yourself, including taking out directors & officers liability.

There are several ways to price construction contracts. In this article, Duncan Cotterill Partner Julia Flattery discusses the best options
There are various ways for calculating the price of construction works. When considering which type of pricing is most appropriate for your project, you should also consider the contractual implications. The most common forms of pricing mechanism and the impact each has on your projects are discussed in more detail below.
Lump sum
This is also referred to as ‘fixed price’ – but don’t be deceived. Fixed price/lump sum contracts mean that there is an agreed price for the works stated in the contract, not that the price is not subject to increase during the build.
A lump sum/fixed price contract can be preferred by principals/clients/owners, as it arguably provides the best cost certainty at the outset. On the other hand, this may mean that clients pay more for the works than would be if payment was based on the actual works carried out. This is because the agreed price is based on what the contractors anticipate it will cost to carry out the project and, generally speaking, is not reduced if the works actually cost less (other than where this is due to an agreed reduction in scope).
Measure and value
This pricing mechanism works on the basis that the works are paid for monthly, based on an assessment as to what quantity of works have been carried out during the preceding month. The contract contains agreed rates for the works and the monthly invoice is based on multiplying the quantity of works by those agreed rates.
The price is therefore based on the agreed rates and not the actual cost to the contractor of carrying out the works. There is therefore risk to both parties if this mechanism is used. The contractor needs to ensure that the agreed rates reflect the likely costs that they will incur. The principal/client/owner has to assess whether the rates proposed by the contractor are an honest reflection of the cost that will be incurred. Contractors are not necessarily obliged to disclose their margins in their supplied rates.
The measure and value pricing mechanism can be useful, where the design will not be sufficiently finalised prior to the contract being entered into and therefore it will not be possible to calculate a mutually acceptable lump sum. The parties should always strive to have as finalised design as possible in advance of works being commenced. However, in some circumstances, this is simply not possible, due to factors such as time pressures requiring the contract to be entered into prior to finalisation.
Cost reimbursement
This is also referred to as cost-plus or charge-up. Under this pricing mechanism, the contractor charges the actual cost incurred in carrying out the works, plus an agreed percentage for margin and overheads. The contractor usually has to provide evidence when claiming payment as to the costs incurred during that payment period.
This type of contract has become more prevalent in recent years due to the uncertainty around the increasing costs of materials, plant and labour. Arguably, it provides a fair price for principals/clients/owners, as they are only paying the actual cost of the works carried out by the contractor plus the agreed margin and overheads. However, the disadvantage is that there is no certainty as to what the cost of the project will be at the outset.
This pricing mechanism also tends to be used where the nature or scope of the work cannot be adequately defined due to time pressures or uncertainties as to the completed project.
A variation on this mechanism is to use a target price approach. This sets a target price at the outset that the contractor is to aim to achieve for the works. If the works come in below this target price, then the cost saving is shared between the parties to acknowledge that the contractor has carried out the works either more efficiently or more innovatively, to reduce the overall cost.
If the works come in over this target price, then the cost increase is also shared between the parties (although usually there is a cap on the increase that the contractor has to bear). This mechanism provides an incentive on the contractor to seek to achieve the best possible price for the works and also provides the principal/client/owner with some degree of price certainty.
Conclusion
It is important to consider which is the best form of pricing mechanism for you and the project. Legal advice should be obtained to assist with this decision and drafting the contract to achieve the required objectives. Contact our construction law team to find out more.

This article expands on the news story we featured last month. While the Supreme Court’s recent decision provides better protection for builders, there are some key things you need to understand about voidable transactions to avoid being caught out
For those readers who have been involved in the construction industry for some time, you will know that there are periods of boom and bust.
During boom times, it’s a great industry to be in – lots of work and improving margins to be made. In downturns, however, there are always those who aren’t prepared and, as a result, suffer the consequences. The history of the construction industry is littered with examples, Mainzeal being one of the most notable recent cases.
Despite the obvious impact of when a construction company collapses, salt is often inadvertently rubbed into the wounds of creditors and suppliers when liquidators require repayment of money they had already received under New Zealand’s “voidable transactions” regime.
As some of you may be aware, a recent Supreme Court decision on the regime was a welcome clarification to those in the building industry when facing a claim by a liquidator requiring money to be returned.
Most people know that when times get tough, difficult decisions often need to be made about who to pay and in what order. Although not a preferred business practice, robbing Peter to pay Paul can be common. Often it’s the creditors or suppliers most important to the business, or making the most noise, who are paid first.
Fair enough, if you happen to be the one who has been chasing the outstanding account and received payment. If you’re one of the other creditors who supplied goods or services in good faith but have missed being paid, it’s not so good.
In an attempt to balance this perceived unfairness, the concept of a “voidable transaction” was introduced – as set out in the Companies Act 1993.
The basic premise of the concept is: if you receive money from a company within two years of it going into liquidation, and the amount was more than you would have otherwise received from its liquidation, the transaction may be set aside.
This means the liquidator may require you to repay any money received and, instead, share equally in any distribution made to creditors. In reality, creditors in a liquidation often receive nothing at all, or only very small payments (representing a fraction of the original debt owing to the creditor).
However, like any good rule, there are exceptions. Most notably, if you are faced with a voidable transaction claim, you can still potentially hold onto the money you have received and refuse to pay this to a liquidator if:
You had acted in good faith;
There were no reasonable grounds to suspect the company was, or would become, insolvent at the time of payment; and
You gave value for the payment or altered your position in a reasonably held belief that payment was validly made and wouldn’t be set aside.
Whether you satisfy the first two criteria set out above is always a question of fact and may depend on the circumstances. A creditor will have a good argument that these criteria are met if the payment was received in the ordinary course of business.
However, the recent Supreme Court case in Allied Concrete Ltd v Meltzer specifically dealt with the third bullet point in determining whether a creditor “gave value” for the payment being received and its timing.
The key issue in the case was whether a creditor or supplier was required to have had exchanged something extra of value at the time the payment was received, or whether the provision of the original goods or services was sufficient to satisfy this limb.
“Suppliers or creditors who received a payment knowing or suspecting that the company in question was or may become insolvent are still caught by the voidable transactions regime
The Supreme Court clarified that value may be given at the time the underlying debt is created (ie, when the original goods or services were provided) – meaning that creditors should be able to satisfy the third limb of the test in every case, and stand a better chance of retaining any payment received.
It’s expected that the Supreme Court ruling will result in fewer cases of liquidators chasing creditors for repayments. It should be noted, however, that suppliers or creditors who received a payment knowing or suspecting that the company in question was, or may become, insolvent are still caught by the voidable transactions regime.
In these circumstances, the liquidator may still require repayment of amounts received under the voidable transaction provisions.
Ultimately, there is no substitute for having good account management and debt-collection processes in place while actively managing any debtors. If necessary, suitable security should always be obtained to ensure prompt payment of accounts receivable.

Parliament has just passed legislation amending the Construction Contracts Act 2002 (CCA) – which applies to commercial construction contracts – to strengthen and clarify the retention money scheme. Legal experts Julia Flattery and Jonathan Forsey from Duncan Cotterill detail what you need to know about the changes
B usinesses in the construction industry should ensure that their retention money processes comply with the updated procedures by 5 October 2023, when the new regime will come into force, and apply to commercial contracts entered into or amended after that date.
What is retention money?
Retention money is an amount held back from a payment made under a construction contract. It is usually a percentage of the amount payable of each instalment. It is generally held to ensure that a contractor performs all of its obligations under the contract, and is then released either on practical completion or after the end of a defect’s notification period.
What are the current requirements?
The CCA currently requires any party to a construction contract (party A) who is withholding retention money from the other party to the construction construct (party B), to hold that retention money on trust for the benefit of party B. The retention money may be held in cash, “other liquid assets that are readily converted into cash”, or a financial instrument such as insurance or a payment bond.
What is changing?
There are a number of key changes being made.
A) Funds deemed to be held on trust
As a result of some uncertainty in the original drafting, the CCA will be amended to explicitly state that a trust is created automatically; there is no need for any explicit intention of party A to hold the money on trust.
The funds will only cease to be trust property when they are paid to party B, used to remedy defects (after notice of the intention to use the funds for that purpose has been given to party B), or party B otherwise gives up its claim to the funds.
B) Clarifying what is retention money
The CCA will also state that funds will be considered to be retention money, whether or not it has actually retained, and whether any amount has been paid to party B. This will resolve issues that have come to light where, if party A becomes insolvent, a partially paid subcontractor will be in a better position than an unpaid subcontractor.
C) Ho w retention money may be held
Retention money will be required to either:
Be held in a bank account; or
Be the subject of a suitable financial instrument such as insurance or a payment bond.
It will no longer be permissible to use “other liquid assets”, such as accounts receivable. It will therefore no longer be possible to use the retention fund as working capital.
As the use (and availability) of financial instruments is rare, most retentions will be held in bank accounts. There are specific requirements for those accounts, including that:
The account must be used solely for the purpose of retention money; and
Party A must ensure that the bank is aware that the account is a trust account for the purposes of holding retention money.
Any interest that accrues in the account will belong to party A.
Party A may choose whether to have individual accounts for each subcontractor’s retention money or to have one account which holds all subcontractors’ funds. If funds are mingled, then party A must ensure that it has accounting records in the form of separate ledgers, identifying each party B for whom money is held, and the construction contract to which it relates.
D) Regular reports on retention money
Party A will be required to give specified information to party B at the time that retention money is held (or as soon as practicable) and then at least every three months thereafter. This information must include:
The most recent amount withheld, the relevant construction contract, and the date of the retention.
The total amount of retention money held by party A for party B.
If held in a bank account, the name of the bank and branch, the name of the account, the name of party B’s ledger (if the account has separate ledgers), and the total balance held for party B.
If using a financial instrument, the name of the issuer, sufficient information to identify the instrument (such as a policy number), and the protected amount.
E) The effect of a receivership or liquidation
If party A is placed into either receivership or liquidation, the receiver or liquidator will hold the retention money on trust, and must deal with it in the same way as party A was required to do. Reasonable fees and costs may be met from the retention money account. The CCA will also confirm that receivers and liquidators will not be liable for any unlawful or improper action taken prior to their appointment. This solves the current position where receivers and liquidators are required to make an application to the court for directions.
Failure to comply
For the first time, the CCA will include penalty provisions for entities who do not comply with the retention money scheme. These penalties include:
For failure to keep retention money as required, a fine of up to $200,000.
For failure to keep proper accounting and other records of retention money, a fine of up to $50,000.
For failure to provide regular reports on retention money, a fine of up to $50,000.
If party A is a company, each director can also be personally liable for failure to keep retention money as required, with a fine of up to $50,000 for each director.
These penalties are cumulative for each breach, rather than a single penalty for a collection of breaches. This means that a director prosecuted for failing to properly hold retention funds for 10 different subcontractors could be liable for a fine up to $500,000, not $50,000.
Compliance with the Act will be monitored and enforced by the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE), which will have powers to obtain information and issue warrants with offences created for obstructing investigation.
What are the next steps?
The Construction Contracts (Retention Money) Amendment Act 2023 will come into force on 5 October 2023. Businesses should start preparing for the change by establishing separate bank accounts for retention money, and ensuring there are proper records of who that money is held on behalf of.

While most projects will run smoothly, what can you do when things get bumpy? Duncan Cotterill Senior Associate Alysha Hinton discusses the various dispute resolution avenues below
D isputes can easily arise between a head contractor and sub-contractor, between a client and contractor, with the council or another construction professional. For a cost effective and timely resolution, it is important to consider informal steps before escalating to formal forums of recourse.
Resolve it yourself
In the first instance, parties involved in a dispute should always try to reach a resolution between themselves directly. Clear, frank and prompt communication can prevent a dispute from escalating and becoming far more expensive to resolve. Good communication can ensure that a functional working relationship is maintained and prevent future disputes from arising. The more adversarial a dispute becomes, the more likely it is to damage the relationship between the parties.
To effectively address the dispute yourself, you should check the basis of your arrangement so that you are clear on your position. Review any written contracts for relevant terms which address the issue and your previous correspondence to establish what was expected of you and what your obligations are before you discuss a solution.
If you can reach a resolution, the agreement should be recorded in writing. Ensure the key background details and issues are accurately recorded so they can be referred to later.
If you can’t reach a resolution, the next step is to check your contract to see if a dispute resolution process is specified such as adjudication, arbitration, or mediation. You can then begin that process.
Consumer protection rights
You should also consider your position in relation to the consumer protection laws that apply to building work.
For example, all residential building work is covered by the implied warranties in the Building Act 2004. These warranties protect the work for up to 10 years regardless of whether there is a contract or not, or the cost of the building project.
The Consumer Guarantees Act 1993 (CGA) and Fair Trading Act 1986 (FTA) may also apply. The CGA applies to building services but not to the buildings or materials. The CGA provides:
Tradespeople need to work with reasonable skill and care; and
Tradespeople need to fix work that isn’t competently done at no extra cost, or an owner may arrange another tradesperson to do that work and pass on the costs to the original tradesperson.
The FTA ensures consumers cannot be misled about products or services.
Formal complaints
Where a building practitioner is licensed or connected to a trade or professional body, they could be subject to a formal complaint. This would likely be in relation to their workmanship or conduct.
Determinations
The Ministry of Business Innovation and Employment (MBIE) is able to issue determinations (legal binding decisions) in relation to certain disputes to do with building work, such as a disagreement with a notice to fix. MBIE is limited in its scope and will not consider disputes about workmanship or contractual disputes.
Mediation
Mediation is an alternative dispute resolution process where both parties try to come to an agreement that is facilitated by an independent third party, the mediator. The mediator does not make a final decision but helps the parties to resolve the issue through discussion. The parties must agree to participate and agree on a mediator. It is an informal and often comparatively inexpensive forum; however, it is not guaranteed that an agreement will be reached.
Arbitration
Arbitration is similar to mediation. It requires the parties to agree to participate and on the selected arbitrator. It is less formal than court but resembles a private court process because an independent party, the arbitrator, decides the outcome. The arbitrator’s decision is binding and enforceable by the courts. It can be as costly as a lower court process but is likely to be more time-efficient.
Adjudication
Adjudication is similar to arbitration – a fast dispute resolution process for resolving building disputes. Adjudication is an option for all construction contracts (verbal or written) under the Construction Contracts Act 2002, even where no dispute resolution process is specified. The orders made are for an interim period but generally are accepted by the parties and usually further proceedings are not required to enforce the decision. The benefit of this option is the construction work is not unduly delayed.
Disputes Tribunal
The Disputes Tribunal is a simplified, faster, and less expensive legal forum which hears a broad range of disputes. It is an informal setting where parties are self-represented, and a binding determination is made by a referee rather than a judge. It is the role of the referee to hear all the evidence and determine what is fair in the circumstances. Their determination can be enforced by the courts. You can claim up to $30,000 and, while you cannot be represented by a lawyer in the Disputes Tribunal, you may wish to seek legal advice to help you prepare.
District Court
If you have exhausted all other informal measures, or if your claim exceeds the $30,000 limit of the Disputes Tribunal, you can consider making a claim in the District Court. This should be your last option and it is recommended that you seek legal advice before initiating a claim. Legal proceedings are often costly and far slower than other dispute resolution forums.

TITLE   : IMPLIED WARRANTIES IMPLICATIONS

In a recent case, Palmer v Hewitt Building Limited & Anor [2021] NZHC 1460, the High Court clarified the application of statutory warranties contained in Part 4A of the Building Act 2004 (the Act). Duncan Cotterill reviews the role of these implied warranties in the residential building sector and what you need to be aware of
The High Court has clarified that the warranties contained in Part 4A of the Act apply only to the contracting party (usually a company) that is named in the relevant contract. Unless an individual builder is also a party to the contract, they will not be subject to the warranties.
A ‘building contractor’ for the warranties in Part 4A of the Act includes anyone building or selling household units. A ‘household unit’ is a building or buildings, or part of a building, that is intended to be used as a home or residence for one household. Accordingly, the implied warranties impose greater liability onto:
Residential building contractors.
House-building companies.
Developers offering house-and-land packages.
People who, for the purpose of on-sale, do any of the following: Build a household unit themselves. Arrange for a household unit to be built.
Build a household unit themselves.
Arrange for a household unit to be built.
Buy a household unit from someone who built it or arranged for it to be built.
In this article, the term ‘building contractor’ will be used to collectively apply to the above. The term ‘client’ in this article will refer to the client or purchaser named in the relevant contract and any subsequent purchaser of the household unit, who is covered by the implied warranties.
What is covered?
All residential building work is covered by the implied warranties in the Act for up to ten years.
There is no way to ‘contract out’ of these warranties. The warranties protect residential building work regardless of value or whether there is a written contract or not. They also transfer to subsequent purchasers, even if they were not a party to the original contract.
In summary, the warranties listed at section 362I of the Act are:
The building work is carried out properly, in accordance with the plans and specifications in the contract and the building consent.
Materials used are suitable for their purpose and new (unless otherwise stated in the contract).
The building work complies with the Building Act, Building Code and all other legislation.
The building work will be completed by the date specified in the contract (or, if no date is specified, within a reasonable time).
The household unit is suitable for occupation on completion of the building work.
The building work and any materials used are reasonably fit for the purpose stated.
What happens if there is a breach?
12-month defect repair period
The Act sets out what are considered ‘defects’. If there is any defect in the building work within twelve months of the building work being completed, the client can require the building contractor to remedy the defect.
During this twelve-month period, the client merely needs to claim a defect exists. If the building contractor disputes that there is a defect, then they bear the burden to prove this. In effect, the Act imposes a mandatory defects liability period of twelve months in all residential building contracts.
Outside the 12-month defect repair period
After the initial twelve-month period, the burden of proof shifts to the client to prove that the building contractor is responsible for any disputed defect in the building work. The building contractor remains liable for any breach of the statutory warranties for ten years.
Dispute resolution process
Where there is a dispute about whether a warranty or warranties are breached, the dispute resolution process set out in the contract (if any) should be followed first. If the contract does not contain a dispute resolution process, or there is no written contract, then the default clauses in the Act will apply.
The Construction Contracts Act 2002 also provides an adjudication process for disputes under contracts for construction work.
Remedies
Section 362M to 362P of the Act sets out the potential remedies for a breach of an implied warranty. A breach of the implied warranties is a breach of the contract.
Once a defect becomes known, the client must raise the issue with the building contractor and, if the issue cannot be resolved between the parties, the client must make a legal claim within six years from the date of the breach.
a) Where the breach can be remedied:
The client may require the building contractor to remedy the breach, including replacing defective materials.
If the building contractor does not remedy the breach within a reasonable time, the client may have the breach remedied by someone else and recover the reasonable costs for having done so from the building contractor, or they may cancel the contract.
In addition to the above options, the client may seek damages from the building contractor for any reasonably foreseeable loss or damage resulting from the breach.
b) If the breach cannot be remedied:
The client may seek damages for any loss of value to the household unit; or
Cancel the contract.
In addition to the above options, the client may seek damages from the building contractor for any reasonably foreseeable loss or damage resulting from the breach.
Recommendations
To mitigate their risk, we recommend that building contractors:
Ensure their contracts include clauses that: Deal with any materials which are not new or are to be recycled. Determine when building work will be considered complete and the twelve-month defect remedy period starts.
Deal with any materials which are not new or are to be recycled.
Determine when building work will be considered complete and the twelve-month defect remedy period starts.
Obtain written consent from the client and the relevant council (if required) of any changes to materials from what was specified in the plans and building consent.
Provide the client with details of any maintenance requirements for the building work – this will assist in excluding liability where the building work isn’t maintained properly.
Ensure their contracts with any subcontractors include clauses that:
Require subcontractors to perform their work to the correct standard.
Enable claims to be made against the subcontractor if their actions have breached the implied warranties.
Keep all documentation, including copies of the contract, for at least the ten-year period.
Check that their insurance policies cover the implied warranties.
Account for this potential liability when structuring their business.
Don’t attempt to contract out of the implied warranties or advise clients that they don’t apply as this will be a breach of the Fair Trading Act.

TITLE   : How to avoid costly disputes

This month we look at some of the common causes of disputes within the construction industry, how to avoid them, and how to minimise the effect they have on a project should they become a problem
T he majority of disputes are resolved without the need to trigger a formal resolution process, but early resolution or not, disputes can dramatically increase the emotional and financial costs on the parties involved in a project.
Inadequate design
A common cause of problems is where the design is incomplete or defective. This is not usually discovered until work has commenced. Design problems can lead to expensive additional work required to fix the problems and in some cases may even require completed work to be removed and replaced.
All parties involved in the project should – together if possible – conduct a thorough review of the designs and plans to anticipate any problems. This should be done before the project is priced and certainly before any contracts are signed.
Poor contracts
Many contracts are signed with deficient or inappropriate clauses. Alternatively, a contract may not be appropriate for the particular project or may not address some of the key items.
Another issue could be that one or both parties do not fully understand the terms. Any party presented with a contract to sign should take a step back and consider their risks on each project.
The golden rule is that a contract prepared by one party will usually attempt to place an unfair amount of risk on the other party. All parties to a project should assess how the contract addresses their main risks and request changes if need be.
Taking legal advice is important, especially where tight margins are involved. Costs involved with a dispute could easily wipe out those margins.
Contentious clauses
Delays in completing the works on time are a common ground for dispute. Contractors must be realistic if they are asked to agree to finish a project by a specified date – contracts must provide for extensions of time in certain circumstances, such as where the project is affected by bad weather.
Another common cause for dispute relates to the contractor’s rights to adjust the price during the project. Contractors should make sure they are able to claim extra expenses where unforeseen matters result in additional works being necessary. Principals will want to narrow down the contractor’s opportunities in the contract to increase the price.
Contract administration
Poor administration of the contract is another cause of construction disputes. If variations and other changes to the contract are not recorded accurately and in accordance with the contract, this can create problems later on.
Once you have agreed on the terms of the contract, it is important to work in accordance with it. Understand your rights and responsibilities and follow the procedures set out in the contract.
Often there is a lot of pressure during the construction phase to make changes at short notice, where variations – especially are agreed orally on site and not recorded in writing. There may be no agreement of the price to be paid for the variation at the time when the work is carried out.
If you do not agree the cost of a variation, or do not follow the correct procedure for dealing with variations, especially as set out in the Building Act for residential contracts over $30,000 – you may later end up in dispute.
It is also important that payment claims and payment schedules are issued on time and comply with the Construction Contracts Act. Specific information must go into those documents or they will be ineffective. If there is any dispute about any of the items in the payment claim, it needs to be recorded clearly on the payment schedule.
If an issue does arise on the site, it should be addressed as quickly as possible. If the issue is ignored or there is insufficient communication between the parties, it could result in a bigger dispute later. Communication is essential!
If a dispute arises:
Check the contract to make sure that procedures are followed correctly.
Make sure that payment claims and schedules are issued on time and in accordance with the Construction Contracts Act.
Check what documentation is available relating to the dispute and make sure there is a good understanding of what occurred by speaking to staff or representatives on site.
Get advice from a professional. This could save time and costs later.

TITLE   : Avoid disclosure dilemmas

Under changes introduced to the Building Act 2004 last year, builders and others in the construction industry must disclose certain information before beginning certain work – it’s important that you understand your obligations
F rom January 2015, mandatory disclosure requirements apply to construction, alteration, demolition or removal works on a residential unit where:
The client requests disclosure documents; or
The price for the works exceeds $30,000.00, including GST.
In these situations, you will need to supply the client with a Prescribed Checklist and Prescribed Disclosure Information. Both of these are pre-printed forms that can be found online and on the MBIE website.
Who do the changes affect?
The disclosure obligations apply to any contractor who has a contract with a homeowner. This could include a variety of residential projects, such as:
Where you are the main builder of a new house (subcontractors do not need to comply).
Where you are refurbishing a kitchen or a bathroom.
Where you are completing site works, such as drainlaying or earthworks, as part of a project.
Where you are demolishing or re-locating a residential building.
When do I need to give disclosure?
The Prescribed Checklist and Prescribed Disclosure Information must be provided to your client before you enter into the building contract, or before they accept your terms and conditions.
Failure to do so is an infringement offence and you could be liable for a fine not exceeding $2,000. Perhaps more importantly, it won’t look good for your business if you are seen to disregard the disclosure requirements.
What do I need to supply?
The Prescribed Checklist does not require you to add any information, as its purpose is to give your prospective client basic information about the building process. It is worth reading before you pass it onto your clients, so that you can anticipate any questions.
The Prescribed Disclosure Information requires more input from you. It should not be considered a ‘box-ticking’ exercise. False or misleading statements or failing to include something that is material could make you liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $20,000.
Key details that need to be provided in the Prescribed Disclosure Information are:
The type of legal entity that you operate under – ie, a partnership, limited liability company or sole trader.
Details of the key contact person who will manage or supervise the building work, including their relevant qualification, skills and experience together with their Licensed Building Practitioner number.
Details of the types of insurance policies you have in relation to the project (contract works, public liability, and/or professional indemnity). Details of the relevant exclusions on each policy must also be inserted. NOTE: We are finding that many builders are not completing these insurance questions correctly, which is understandable given they are about insurance policies. We recommend you ask your insurance broker to complete the form. They likely only need to complete it once in any insurance year, so you can use it as a template unless there are policy changes. As an aside, the contractor is unlikely to cover the contracts works insurance where works are being completed on an existing house.
Information about any guarantees or warranties that you will provide to your client. NOTE: Again, this question is not being answered properly in many of the contracts we deal with. It asks for the type of warranty or guarantee, the period of the warranty, and the limits or exclusions on cover. It should be fairly straightforward extracting the information from the guarantee or warranty documents that you intend on providing. If you are stuck, we would recommend discussing the question with the company providing the guarantee or warranty. Some contractors simply insert “usual sub-trades warranties”, which gives very little information away. Clued-up home owners will want to know and will compare your offering to other contractors.
If you are stuck, we would recommend discussing the question with the company providing the guarantee or warranty. Some contractors simply insert “usual sub-trades warranties”, which gives very little information away. Clued-up home owners will want to know and will compare your offering to other contractors.
What do I need to disclose once a project is finished?
As soon as practicable after completion of the works, you must provide the following information to your client:
A copy of each insurance policy that is current on completion.
A copy of any guarantees or warranties that apply to materials or services that comprise the building work, including whether they can be transferred, how to make claims under them, and whether they need to be signed and returned to the issuers in order to be valid. You should be able to obtain this information from the relevant clauses of the guarantee or warranty. Any problems, call the issuer. We suggest you email the client and refer them to each clause. Of course, make sure you obtain guarantees and warranties from sub-contractors before they leave the site for good.
Information about maintenance that your client must carry out in order to meet the durability requirements of the building code, or in order to keep a guarantee or warranty valid. This information should be contained in the guarantee, warranty or paperwork that comes with a product.
There is no prescribed form for the post-contract disclosure, so we recommend you email a letter to the client attaching the information.
Failure to comply is an offence and you could be fined up to $2,000.
The new disclosure rules add further administrative burdens for contractors. They will be time consuming at the start but much easier once you’ve completed a few. It is important to get it right, given the fines involved. Proper disclosure will also be good marketing for your business.

The use of independent contractors is widespread across the construction industry and the line between employees and contractors can be blurred. Senior Associate at Duncan Cotterill Alysha Hinton explains the difference between them
It is common in the construction industry to engage contractors, who operate their own business, to provide skilled labour for projects. This can include tradesman builders, scaffolders, plasterers, welders, plumbers, electricians, etc.
However, employees and contractors have different rights and responsibilities, so it’s important to know which category a worker actually falls into. Employers must be wary of changing relationships with contractors and not to structure an arrangement to shield themselves from the obligations and liabilities which arise when hiring employees.
In this article, we review the distinction between a contractor and employee, and what you need to be aware of.
Who is an employee? Any person who is employed to do any work for hire or reward under a contract of service, also known as an employment agreement, is an employee. The reward is almost always a wage or salary.
Employment rights available to employees include:
Remuneration that is at least the minimum wage.
The right to pursue personal grievances.
Return to work rights, such as limited duties after an accident.
Redundancy rights and the right to be consulted about the loss of employment.
Holiday and leave entitlements.
Having a written employment agreement.
People working in triangular employment arrangements may also be employees. This is where a worker is employed by one party but works for another business or organisation which directs them on their day-to-day work. This may be in a ‘labour-for-hire’ situation or where a worker is ‘temping’.
Who is a contractor? Contractors are engaged by a party (such as a head contractor) to perform services under a contract for services, also known as an independent contractor agreement. Contractors are self-employed and are not paid a wage or salary. They earn income by invoicing the party engaging them for their services, they also pay their own tax and ACC levies.
In the construction industry, genuine contractors typically work at different locations, on particular jobs, for a range of customers, using their own equipment, setting their own rates, and invoicing for their work.
Health and safety legislation applies to both employees and contractors, but most employment legislation does not apply to contractors. A contractors’ rights and responsibilities are determined by general civil law, such as negligence. Contractors have fewer entitlements than employees, including not being able to bring personal grievances or get paid for annual or sick leave.
What happens if a contractor is actually an employee? If a worker is hired as a contractor but should have actually been an employee, then that worker may miss out on minimum employment entitlements, and may pay tax and ACC levies that they would otherwise not be required to pay. If this happens then the employer may be liable for extra costs such as:
Unpaid PAYE tax.
Unpaid minimum wages.
Holidays and leave entitlements.
An employer can be liable regardless of whether they hire someone as a contractor intentionally in a ‘sham’ contracting arrangement, or accidentally mislabel the working relationship.
How do you know if someone is a contractor or employee? To decide whether a worker is a contractor or an employee, the true nature of the working relationship is assessed, not just the label given to the relationship by the parties. The following legal tests are used to help determine whether someone is in an employment relationship:
Intention test – what the parties intended the relationship to be.
Control versus independence test – the greater control the employer has over the worker’s work, the more likely they are an employee.
Integration test – how fundamental is their work to the employer’s business.
Economic reality test – is the worker really a person in business on their own account.
All of these tests should be applied to consider the relationship as a whole. Consider the following Barry vs. C I Builders Ltd legal case.
Last year the Employment Court found that a builder who had been engaged as an independent contractor for three years was really an employee. Mr. Barry entered into the arrangement with C I Builders (“CIB”) as a contractor, but claimed he was treated as if he was an employee, and the contractor label did not reflect the true nature of the relationship.
Despite the original intent, several factors indicated that there was in fact an employment relationship between Mr. Barry and CIB. For example:
Mr. Barry generally worked consistent hours over the three years and was expected to turn up and work a full day.
Mr. Barry did not work for anyone else and worked 40 hours per week for CIB, which made it unrealistic for him to work for others at the same time.
There was nothing to suggest he subcontracted or could have subcontracted work.
CIB provided most of the tools he used and sometimes provided a branded van, which showed Mr. Barry was being integrated into the business.
Mr. Barry didn’t issue invoices but provided CIB with hours he worked which were passed onto the customer.
Mr. Barry was paid weekly based on the hours he worked, rather than per completion of tasks.
Mr. Barry was included in CIB’s application for the Wage Subsidy.
Mr. Barry did not bear any commercial risk, nor did he have the ability to make a profit by completing his work more efficiently, or the ability to accrue business goodwill.
Although Mr. Barry was relatively experienced, he was closely supervised and directed by CIB.
Mr. Barry was told what to do, where and when, with little flexibility to determine his own work including advising the site manager if he wanted to leave early or take leave.
There was nothing that differentiated Mr. Barry from other employees to an outside observer.
Because Mr. Barry was successful, he was able to pursue a personal grievance alleging unjustifiable dismissal – a course of action only available to employees.
Going forward what should you do? Barry vs. C I Builders Ltd is a warning bell to the construction industry. In that case, the Employment Court reiterated that employers must not label workers as contractors to avoid employment obligations. Where a worker is engaged to perform work regularly, the question must always be asked whether they are working as a contractor or as an employee.
Working relationships can and frequently do change over time, so any business engaging contractors should monitor how contracting arrangements continue to operate.

With mandatory vaccination a hot topic these days, and two more workforces coming under the Vaccination Order, Duncan Cotterill sheds light on the first court case to challenge dismissal over an employee’s refusal to be vaccinated
Written in October 2021
Can an employer lawfully require that a role is only performed by vaccinated staff? Could an unvaccinated staff member have his/her employment terminated on that basis? This question has been the ‘hot topic’ of the employment law sphere in recent months. Recently, the case of GF v New Zealand Customs Service became the first piece of litigation to substantively address this issue.
The case
GF was employed by New Zealand Customs (Customs) as a Border Protection Officer at a maritime port facility. GF had objections to obtaining the COVID-19 vaccine and refused to do so. In light of the COVID-19 pandemic and government guidance, Customs carried out a comprehensive health and safety risk assessment while consulting with staff. In parallel, the Government issued the COVID-19 Public Health Vaccination Order 2021 (Vaccination Order) which required “front line” border workers to be vaccinated against COVID-19.
Customs believed GF’s role fell under the Vaccination Order. Its health and safety assessment had also concluded that vaccination was required, given the risk of exposure to the virus. As such, Customs decided that the GF’s role (amongst others) could only be occupied by vaccinated individuals. Following lengthy consultation, Customs had determined that GF was unwilling to be vaccinated. It explored changing work arrangements to mitigate exposure risk, and redeployment into a different role. Customs was unable to identify other available roles or reach an agreement. GF was accordingly dismissed her from her role on the day that the Vaccination Order came into effect.
In the Employment Relations Authority, GF challenged both this decision and the process used to reach it. She did so on a number of grounds, most relevantly that there were no health and safety reasons that could justify requiring the role to be vaccinated. Customs, in turn, argued GF’s employment was justifiably ended once the Vaccination Order came into effect, and that prior to the Vaccination Order, they had conducted a thorough health and safety risk assessment and determined on legitimate and reasonable grounds that incumbents in GF’s role were required to be vaccinated.
The Authority agreed with Customs, ruling that its actions ultimately met the standard of a fair and reasonable employer.
Key takeaways
This case serves as a clear statement of the standard that employers will likely need to meet should COVID-19 necessitate a change to the terms and conditions of a role.
While the Vaccination Order provided ample justification in this case, the Authority Member made it clear that the courts will not unduly ‘step into the employer’s shoes’ in determining whether changes to a role (like requiring vaccination) are justifiably required. The Authority simply must be satisfied that the decision made was reasonable. In practice, this will mean a thorough and genuine health and safety risk assessment being carried out in consultation with the employee. WorkSafe guidance recommends that employers take into account two factors when conducting a risk assessment: The likelihood of a worker being exposed to COVID-19 while performing the role; and The potential consequences of that exposure on others (for example, community spread).
The likelihood of a worker being exposed to COVID-19 while performing the role; and The potential consequences of that exposure on others (for example, community spread).
The likelihood of a worker being exposed to COVID-19 while performing the role; and
The potential consequences of that exposure on others (for example, community spread).
The Authority re-iterated the key tenets of the process which employers must follow, as prescribed by s.103A Employment Relations Act 2000: Sufficient investigation: The employer should explore the reasons that the employee is declining to become vaccinated, while acknowledging he/she’s right to refuse under the NZ Bill of Rights Act. In this case GF refused to engage with Customs on this matter, and put Customs in the position that it could not take her views into account. Consultation : The employer should provide all the information it can which is relevant to the decision to make vaccination mandatory for the particular roles. Customs’ comprehensive health and safety risk assessment was carried out with close regard to these legislative obligations. The employee must be given a reasonable opportunity to provide responses to the concerns or proposals, and the employer must carefully consider any responses given.

The employer should consider all alternatives before making a decision to dismiss. Options like changing work arrangements or redeployment to lessen health and safety risks need to be fully explored with the employee.
Moving forward
Requiring the incumbents of particular roles to become vaccinated is a complicated issue. There is significant interplay between contractual and statutory obligations, from health and safety considerations to employees’ rights under the NZ Bill of Rights Act and the Human Rights Act.
What is emerging as a key point is that, despite the difficulties which employers face in fast-moving and uncertain environments, employment law obligations do not change. While an employer’s actions will be considered in light of the circumstances at the time, the obligations of consultation, communication and good faith remain.
Finding themselves in unfamiliar territory, Customs closely adhered to its fundamental employment obligations. This ultimately meant that its actions were found to have been justified. The grounds for its decision were very strong, both because GF’s role involved border control, and because the Vaccination Order made vaccinations in those roles mandatory.
However, matters remain unsettled for roles involving less clear-cut health and safety risks, or roles which are not covered by a Vaccination Order. It is likely that further cases will be litigated in the future which will provide further guidance. In any case, employers should keep the fundamental employment obligations at the forefront of the mind when addressing COVID-19 issues.

While renovations and refurbishment projects may not always be on the same scale as building an entire home, your responsibilities and liabilities are the same for every project you complete, large or small.
U nder the Building Act 2004 (the Act), you have to comply with the following obligations with respect to any job – whether it’s commercial or residential, a new build or a renovation.
All builders are required to ensure that the building work they complete complies with the related building consent and the plans and specifications. In most cases, refurbishment or renovation projects will involve work that comes within the definition of “building work” under the Act.
All builders must ensure that the building work complies with the Building Code.
Where you carry out renovation or refurbishment work on houses, you will have additional obligations – but only where you have a contract with the homeowner (they won’t apply if you are a subcontractor and don’t have a contract with the homeowner).
Your obligations are:
You must have a written contract with the owner if the price for your work is more than $30,000 including GST, or if they request one. You can be fined for failing to do so. You will also need to disclose certain information to the owner before they sign the contract (see ‘Avoid disclosure dilemmas’ on page 20 of Under Construction Issue 57, which provides a summary of those obligations).
You will need to comply with implied warranties for your work, whether your contract includes them or not. These essentially require you to complete the work with reasonable care and skill and in a proper and competent manner. You can find the list at section 362I of the Act. You cannot require the owner to agree to exclude those warranties.
If the homeowner notifies you of a defect within 12 months of completing the work, you will have to return to the property within a reasonable time to fix the defect. You cannot shorten or exclude the 12-month defect period in your contract with the owner. If you do not believe a defect exists, the onus is on you to prove it doesn’t; once the 12-month period is over, the onus transfers to the homeowner to prove a defect exists.
You will be responsible for ‘reasonably foreseeable’ losses that result from defects. An example would be where you install an upstairs bathroom in a way that causes a water leak. As well as fixing the problem, you would be required to pay for damage caused by the water leak, such as a damaged ceiling or carpet below.
The obligations listed above flow from the Act. You will also have separate obligations in the contract with the building owner.
Defective works liability
As most builders are aware, liability for defects exists beyond the 12-month defect period – it exists for up to ten years from the date you complete the work and possibly longer, depending on when the owner discovers the defect.
That is a very long time to consider an ongoing risk to your business, but you need to take all jobs within this timeframe into account, particularly high-risk projects that include potentially problematic work, such as structural works, replacing windows or installing bathrooms.
NOTE: The ten-year defect period, during which you can face a claim, is not limited to the one homeowner. Any homeowner living in the home during that time can make a claim against you, if you break any of the obligations set out above.
What can you do to reduce your risk?
The main ways to control these risks are:
Do great work and be extra vigilant in checking the quality of the work. Quality control is essential, even if it takes time.
Where you use subcontractors, ensure your contracts with them require their work to be completed to the required standard.
You should also discuss with your broker whether you can insure the ten-year risk.
Guarantees issued by a Builders Association may also re-direct problems from you to the guarantee provider.

The building sector is under pressure and some firms are starting to crack. Duncan Cotterill Partner Alysha Hinton discusses what it means if a firm you work for goes under
A ccording to figures from the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment, during the 12-month period ending 23 May 2022, 92 companies in the building sector went into liquidation.
It is no secret that building companies are under immense pressure because of Covid-19, which has created supply chain issues, shortages in labour and materials, and high costs. All of these factors are increasing the financial risks that building companies are taking on and exacerbating the pressures at all stages of the construction supply chain. This raises some important questions, particularly around what it means for sub-contractors or workers if their head contractor goes insolvent.
What does insolvency mean?
If a company is ‘insolvent’ this means one of two things:
Their debts cannot be paid when they are due.
Or their total debt is more than the value of all their assets.
Liquidation vs receivership
Though the outcome is often the same, there are a few important differences between a company going into liquidation or receivership.
Receivership A receiver is nominated by a secured creditor (eg, a bank) and acts for the benefit of that creditor alone. A receiver decides the best way to recover the debt – they may decide to keep the company trading or simply take possession and sell the secured assets. After this process, the company resumes possession of the remaining assets and theoretically could continue trading, but will most commonly go into liquidation.
Liquidation If a company is unable to pay its debts, meaning the company owes more than it has available, it may be put into liquidation. A company can be put into liquidation by its shareholders, its board of directors or a creditor(s). A liquidator is then appointed to take possession of all the assets of the company and distribute these to the creditors in order of priority. All creditors may record their debt against the company during a meeting of the creditors. Liquidators have the power to investigate the company and hold the directors personally accountable if they have breached their duties.
Secured vs unsecured creditor
There are two kinds of creditors: secured and unsecured.
Secured creditors have the right to repossess and sell a debtor’s assets that they have a security interest over if the debtor falls behind in payments. They are in a stronger position when a company faces financial difficulties.
Unsecured creditors do not have the right to repossess or sell any of the debtor’s assets if they default on payments. They are reliant on recovering their money through the liquidation process.
What are the next steps if a company becomes insolvent?
If a contractor/sub-contractor/supplier becomes insolvent and a receiver or liquidator is appointed, then the next steps are:
Secure the site/assets – once a liquidator or receiver is appointed, the control of the site passes to them. An assessment of the assets will then take place.
To have your claim recognised, act fast. File a claim with the liquidator for any money you are owed as soon you are notified of the insolvency.
Review your contract(s) – are there insolvency mitigation clauses in there (step-in rights, etc.), has the contract automatically been terminated ?
Establish if direct contracting between the solvent parties is still possible.
The effect on sub-contractors
If a head contractor goes under, moneys owed to sub-contractors becomes general unsecured debt. Unfortunately, once secured creditors are paid, there are often insufficient funds to repay the unsecured creditors everything they are owed.
An additional risk to sub-contractors is site access. If your property is on-site, it may be some time before it is identified, distinguished from the head contractor’s or other third party’s property, and returned to you. You might even lose title to your property and it could be sold as an asset of the head contractor unless your interest has already been registered on the Personal Property Securities Register (PPSR).
If you find yourself locked out of a site because a head contractor has gone under, contact the liquidator or receiver directly. Do not force entry onto the site – accessing the site without the approval of a liquidator or receiver could result in a trespass notice being issued and police involvement.
What about retention money?
The Construction Contracts Act 2002 (CCA) sets out the retention money scheme. Retention money is an amount held back from a payment made under a construction contract. It is generally held to ensure that a contractor performs all of its obligations under the contract and is then released either on practical completion, or after the end of a defects’ notification period.
The CCA currently requires any party to a construction contract (party A) who is withholding retention money from the other party to the construction construct (party B), to hold that retention money on trust for the benefit of party B. The retention money may be held in cash, “other liquid assets that are readily converted into cash”, or a financial instrument such as insurance or a payment bond.
If party A is placed into either receivership or liquidation, the receiver or liquidator will hold the retention money on trust and must deal with it in the same way as party A was required to. Court orders are required to administer retention moneys. However, proposed reform of the CCA will make the retention position clearer and remove the need to apply for Court orders.
What about employees?
Employees have preferential claims against unsecured creditors for any of the following:
Unpaid wages or salary earned in the four months before the company’s liquidation.
Payroll deductions and donations deducted from an employee’s pay but not transferred by the employer.
Any holiday pay that had not been paid to an employee before the company’s liquidation.
KiwiSaver contributions, child support payments and/or student loan payments deducted from the employee’s salary or wages but not transferred by the employer.
Redundancy compensation if there is an entitlement in the employment agreement.
On the day that a company goes into liquidation, all employment agreements may be terminated. However, where the liquidator needs employees to continue working to generate funds for repayments, the liquidator may make arrangements with employees to enter into a new employment contract with the liquidator.

TITLE   : VACCINATIONS IN THE WORKPLACE

Covid-19 has thrown up a number of challenges for businesses. This article looks at the most recent one – the vaccination – and addresses some common questions
As more than 2.2 million doses of the Covid-19 vaccine have now been administered in New Zealand (at time of writing), vaccination is both a live and novel issue in the workplace.
Employers are required to balance health and safety obligations against employees’ human rights and privacy when it comes to their vaccination status. Considering these are, at times, competing interests, we address what can and cannot be done regarding workers’ vaccination against Covid-19.
Can employers require workers to be vaccinated?
Employers cannot require any individual worker to be vaccinated. Under the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 every person has the right to refuse medical treatment, which includes vaccination. However, there are select roles where vaccination is required to be able to perform the work.
At present there are very few types of work where vaccination is or would be required in New Zealand. But this could change if our domestic Covid-19 situation altered significantly. Generally, vaccination is required where the work is:
Covered by a Health Order.
Otherwise specified by the Government.
Where a risk assessment shows there is a high chance of getting and/or infecting others with Covid-19 (we discuss this further below).
For example, the New Zealand Government has made it mandatory under the Public Health Response (Vaccinations) Amendments Order 2021 for border workers to be vaccinated.
Where vaccination is required for a role, it is important that employers address barriers to accessing vaccinations and set timeframes on when this should be completed by.
How can an employer assess whether a role needs to be done by vaccinated workers?
To determine whether a role must be performed by vaccinated workers, employers need to conduct a risk assessment for exposure to Covid-19. This assessment applies to all workers, both employees and independent contractors.
Employers must consider:
The likelihood of exposure to Covid-19 while performing the role; and
Potential consequences of exposure on others (i.e. community spread).
If an employer concludes there is a high risk of exposure and there would be significant potential consequences of exposure on others, then the role must be performed by a vaccinated worker.
Employers must also involve workers, unions and other representatives in the risk assessment process, and when deciding how to minimise or eliminate risks of exposure to Covid-19.
Are employees entitled to be paid for their time off work to get a vaccination?
While there is no strict legal requirement for employees to be paid for their time off to get a vaccination, the New Zealand Government is encouraging businesses to support the vaccination programme by:
Allowing staff to access vaccination centres during work hours
Not requiring the use of annual leave, or deducting wages, for time off to get vaccinated; and
Facilitating on-site vaccination where appropriate.
Where vaccination is required for the role, employers should consider providing special leave for this purpose.
The use of annual leave or other leave for time off to be vaccinated must be agreed to by both parties as per normal employment processes.
Can employers ask an employee or potential employee to tell them if they have been vaccinated?
Health information is personal information under the Privacy Act. As such employees or potential employees cannot be required to inform their employer of their vaccination status.
There is an exception to this general position where an employee is working in a role that requires vaccinated workers.
Employees cannot be disadvantaged for not disclosing their vaccination status and employers should be mindful not to discriminate on this basis.
Where an employee has not disclosed their status or failed to provide proof that they have been vaccinated, employers may consider that the employee is unvaccinated. It is important that this is communicated to the employee, especially if there will be consequences regarding their employment if they are to be treated as unvaccinated.
Can employers dismiss their employees if they refuse to be vaccinated?
If the employee works in a role where vaccination is not required, then they cannot be dismissed for refusing to be vaccinated.
If an employee works in a role where vaccination is required but they refuse to be vaccinated, dismissal should be the last resort. Alternative options that should be looked at prior to a dismissal include:
Changing the employee’s work arrangements, such as the location of work and hours.
Whether a period of leave would be appropriate (eg, if the employee is pregnant and does not wish to be vaccinated during pregnancy).
Restructuring or transferring the employee to another role.
Usual employment law obligations to follow a lawful process and consult with the employee and their representatives remain.
Employers are not able to simply add vaccination clauses into existing employment agreements without following proper risk assessment and consultation processes.
Consider the approach
Vaccination status can be a sensitive subject so employers should carefully consider their approach when discussing this with workers. It is important employers stick to the issue of vaccination only and do not make enquiries about things they do not need to know, for example if an employee’s religious beliefs prevent them from being vaccinated.
A person’s vaccination status is private, and employers should be mindful to keep this information secure. Collecting, storing and accessing personal information carries obligations under the Privacy Act and any disclosures should be managed in line with the Act’s requirements.
Overall, obligations of good faith and following full and fair processes under the Employment Relations Act 2000 continue to apply to Covid-19 related issues, including vaccination. In this case employers must balance obligations under the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act, Employment Relations Act, Privacy Act and Human Rights Act.

Redeployment is when an employer tries to find a new job within the company for an employee whose current role is being disestablished. It is a key and often overlooked step in conducting a lawful redundancy process. In this article, Duncan Cotterill partner Alastair Espie and solicitor Lauren Tonkin discuss how builders should manage the process
A common mistake we see from employers is failing to offer an employee redeployment into a suitable vacant role, leading to an otherwise wholly justified redundancy being deemed an unjustified dismissal.
In this guide, we will unpack what employers need to consider when it comes to redeployment by outlining its requirements, explaining how to work through the process, and highlighting the importance of consultation.
When is redeployment required?
When an employer disestablishes an employee’s role, they are required to explore any potential opportunities to retain the employee in a different role before dismissing them for redundancy. Remember, termination of employment should always be a last resort.
Where there is a vacant role, which an employee impacted by restructuring has the necessary skills and experience to perform or would be capable of performing the role with reasonable training, the job should be offered to the employee. A common example of this is where a role is disestablished and replaced with a newly established role, which the affected employee would be capable of performing. However, this obligation may also arise where there is a vacant role, which may be substantially different from the employee’s current position but which they are capable of performing or would be capable of performing with additional training.
In situations where more than one affected employee is suitable for the same redeployment opportunity – for example, where two positions have been disestablished and a new hybrid position established – the employer would need to undertake a selection process to determine which of the impacted employees should be redeployed into that position.
There may be circumstances where it is unclear whether the employee has the necessary skills to perform the duties of the role and the employer may offer them an opportunity to apply for the role. This would generally be limited to situations where the vacancy is for a completely different role or one that is considerably more senior.
To be clear, the affected employee should still be considered as the preferred candidate prior to considering other unaffected employees or taking the role to market. This is another common mistake we see employers make by advertising a vacant role while the restructuring process is ongoing, without first giving the affected employee an opportunity to be considered for it.
It is only after an employer has considered all possible redeployment opportunities and has reasonably concluded that they are not suitable that they can move forward with declaring an employee redundant.
How to work through redeployment?
Employers are expected to take a proactive approach to redeployment and not treat it as an afterthought. This derives from the good faith obligation to actively and constructively seek to maintain the employment relationship and to give an employee the opportunity to comment before any decision is made that could impact their employment.
In practical terms, the case law has indicated that, to meet its redeployment obligations, an employer needs to:
• Identify any potential vacancies or redeployment opportunities within the business and present them to the employee. • Actively engage with the employee about these vacancies (or lack thereof) and seek their feedback. • If the employer decides that the employee is not suitable to be redeployed into a particular role, explain its reasoning for coming to that conclusion.
Identification
As set out above, employers have an obligation to proactively identify any potential alternative positions within the business. The extent of this duty is broad and may, for example, extend to exploring roles unrelated to the employee’s current position and/or vacancies in different branches of a larger organisation.
Differences in duties, terms, remuneration and/or skillset required for a role may or may not be a barrier to redeployment. Ultimately, the employer must take all reasonable steps to identify any possible redeployment opportunities and then consult with the employee on the reasonableness of the redeployment in the circumstances.
Consultation
As with any decision which may adversely impact an employee’s employment, the key word is consultation. An employer shouldn’t decide on their own if a redeployment opportunity is suitable without first consulting with the affected employee as part of the restructuring process.
Even where it may seem clear that the employee lacks the necessary skillset for a vacant position and/or the employee has expressed no interest in the role, the employer should still consult with the employee about the opportunity. It may be the case that it is reasonable to conclude that the employee was not suitable for the position; however, failure to consult with the employee about the vacancy before reaching that conclusion may lead to a successful unjustified dismissal claim.
When consulting with an employee about a redeployment opportunity, the employer should seek feedback on whether they are interested in the role and what their skillset is.
For example, when considering whether to offer an employee a vacancy, which would require the employee to undergo additional training, it would be helpful to get the employee’s feedback on how they could apply their current skillset, whether, and to what extent, they are prepared to undertake additional training, as well as their view on any other relevant factors about the role (eg, seniority, remuneration and/or other terms) to gauge the reasonableness of the redeployment.
While the issue of how far an employer must go to upskill the employee when considering redeployment is yet to be fully tested before the courts, consultation should flush out the employee’s views as to why they consider themselves to be capable of performing a particular role. If the employer ultimately concludes that an employee is not suitable for redeployment into a particular role, the decision will naturally be more robust if it has been arrived at via a thorough consultation process.
Finally, and importantly, even where the employer has been unable to identify any vacant roles, there is still a requirement to consult with the employee about any potential opportunities the employee may be able to identify.
If, following consultation, the employer concludes that the employee is not suitable for any of the identified redeployment opportunities, it needs to explain its reasoning to the employee.
Case study: Stellar Elements New Zealand Ltd v Amesbury [2024] NZEmpC 136
This case concerned an application for interim reinstatement; however, the Employment Court discussed the issue of the sufficiency of an employer’s efforts to explore redeployment opportunities.
In this case, the employee had been informally seconded to a different role within the business and ultimately applied to be permanently appointed to this role; however, he withdrew his application due to bonus-related issues. Notably, the employee continued to perform the duties of the ‘seconded’ role. The company subsequently disestablished the employee’s primary role but did not offer to redeploy him into the role he was currently performing (which was still vacant).
What if the employee has already expressed that they are not interested in the role?
Case law suggests that an employer may still be required to present a role the employee has previously expressed no interest in as a potential redeployment opportunity.
With Stellar Enterprises, the Court considered the employer’s duty to explore a redeployment opportunity in circumstances where the employee had previously withdrawn his application for the role (prior to the redundancy process).
While the employee had previously withdrawn his application, his circumstances had since changed in that his primary role was being disestablished; however, he was under the impression that the permanent position had been filled when, in fact, the original preferred candidate had ultimately decided not to accept the role.
The Court found that it was reasonably arguable that the employer was obligated to be proactive in informing the employee of the availability of the permanent role and explore it as a redeployment opportunity.
What are employers’ obligations in relation to overseas redeployment opportunities?
An employer’s obligation to explore redeployment opportunities may extend beyond New Zealand’s borders to international roles.
Stellar Enterprises was part of a larger international organisation, Amdocs. There was evidence that suggested there may have been vacancies within Amdocs that could have been considered.
The Court considered it arguable that a fair and reasonable employer, supported by a well-resourced international organisation, would be expected to explore such options.
While the Court did not go so far as to say that employers must redeploy staff into an entirely separate legal entity, employers who are part of broader corporate groups should at least be mindful that this is an area where the law may evolve moving forward.
Key takeaways for employers
Redeployment is an important step in the redundancy process, as required by the employer’s duty of good faith, and is where we see a lot of employers fall short. To avoid stumbling at the final hurdle, we advise employers to:
• Think carefully about other potential roles within the business, including at other branches or locations if applicable. Take a proactive approach and engage with the affected employee to explore whether there may be any reasonable redeployment opportunities before dismissing them for redundancy. Only terminate an employee’s employment as a last resort.

TITLE   : Reporting faulty workmanship

Prior to the introduction of Licensed Building Practitioners (LBPs), there was a lot of uncertainty about the legal obligations on a building professional who discovers faulty workmanship undertaken by another trade.
Arguably, the obligations differed based on what part of the building process you were contracted to complete and on the particular role undertaken. For example, there were different requirements for a builder who relies on a faulty substrate, compared to the obligations on a builder who noticed faults which were completely separate to their work, or to those people engaged in an investigative role (such as a remedial specialist or a pre-purchase inspector).
However, following the introduction of section 89 to the Building Act 2004, ignoring faulty work, or choosing to overlook it in certain circumstances, will not be an option. This is because section 89 places a statutory duty on LBPs to notify both the building owner and the council if they identify any building work that does not comply with the relevant building consent.
Since March last year, Restricted Building Work (RBW) can only be done by an LBP. The seven available licences cover design, site supervision, bricklaying and blocklaying, carpentry, external plastering, foundations, and roofing. If the RBW covers more than one of these areas, either the LBP must be licenced in each area, or a number of LPBs will be needed to each complete the part of the work that is within their expertise.
A person who carries out or supervises RBW who is not an LBP commits an offence and can be liable to a fine of up to $20,000. If a person knows that the person they have hired to carry out or supervise RBW is not an LBP, that person can also be liable for a fine not exceeding $20,000.
LPBs are listed on an online register for identification: http://lbp.dbh.govt.nz/publicregister/search.aspx
Once registered, an LBP is required to act competently and becomes accountable to the Building Practitioners Board where that competency is not met.
RBW includes most residential building or renovation work and a lot of the work that requires a building consent. The focus is on ensuring the integrity of the building is maintained, particularly with respect to being structurally sound and weathertight. The intention of the LBP requirements is to help avoid faulty workmanship and defective buildings.
In addition to the requirements of competence and as mentioned above, LBPs are under a statutory obligation (under section 89 of the Building Act 2004) to notify the building owner and the local council if they identify work that does not comply with the building consent.
This notification must:
State that the LBP is of the view that building work carried out under the building consent does not comply with that consent.
State how the building work does not so comply.
Be given as soon as practicable after the LBP has formed that view.
Most building consents include a condition that all building work must comply with the New Zealand Building Code. As a result, if building work does not comply with the Building Code, the LBP is also under an obligation to report the non-compliance.
1. Relating to builder’s work or building consent
Previously, there may have been circumstances where you are asked to complete work that relies on defective work (for example, a membrane applicator asked to apply a membrane to a faulty substrate).
In the past, the obligation to raise the issue of any defective work in those circumstances would have depended on the nature of the defective work in question. If a tradesperson identified existing defects related to his work, he was under an obligation to point out the defect to the owner and head contractor. If the defect meant that the tradesperson’s own work would not comply with the Building Code and good trade practice, he would be under an obligation to not undertake the work until the defect was remedied.
However, if a tradesperson identified existing defects not related to his work, he was only under an obligation to raise the issues with the head contractor and/or the principal. If the defects were accepted by the head contractor and/or the principal, the tradesperson would not be required to remedy the defects or to point the defects out to the local council.
Now, with the introduction of the LBP scheme, all LBPs are under obligation to notify the building owner, as well as the local council, of any faulty work relating to the building consent. In some cases, this may be contrary to the wishes of the head contractor and/or the principal as it may increase the cost of the build. While this could make it a difficult subject to broach, failure to give notification to the local council would be a breach of section 89 of the Building Act, and may result in a complaint to the Building Practitioner’s Board.
2. Not relating to builder’s work or building consent
If you are contracted to complete alterations and notice faults in the existing building that are not related to your work or the building consent – for example, if you are contracted to build a deck and notice that the building is not watertight – your responsibilities are slightly different.
There is no obligation to inform a territorial authority of existing defects in the building, but the owner may appreciate the information if you do raise the issue. Also, by failing to disclose that information to the owner, there is the risk that the owner may bring a negligence claim against a contractor who knew of a fault (and the risk it caused) but chose not to raise the issue.

Fixed price contracts aren’t always fixed price, which can lead to confusion and potential souring in builder-client relationships. In this article, Duncan Cotterill Partner Julia Flattery discusses why a fixed price contract may not always be fixed
When clients engage a builder for residential construction, it is a common misunderstanding that the price stated in the ’fixed price’ contract is, in fact, the final fixed price and will not change during the build.
It is very unusual for a build contract to be truly fixed; ie, not subject to any change between signing the contract and completion of the build.
There are many reasons why the price may increase; these circumstances are provided for in the majority of residential build contracts in the market. This is why it is important for builders to fully understand the terms of the contract they are providing to customers and to engage a lawyer to assist with negotiating these provisions.
Some of the more commonly encountered factors are set out below.
Variations
It is clearly reasonable that if the scope of the build changes, then the price should change. The initially agreed upon price will reflect the scope at that time. Therefore, if that scope is subsequently changed, the price will need to change to reflect the amended scope. This is why it is key that the scope agreed upon signing is as detailed as possible and accurately sets out what you are intending to build.
Although it can be tempting to get the contract signed as quickly as possible and move into construction, spending some additional time finalising the detail of the scope can be well worth it in terms of reducing the risk of changes being necessary.
Delays
Most contracts allow the builder to claim additional costs, if there is a delay to the build that causes additional cost to be incurred. There are many reasons why a build may be delayed, including consent authority delays, adverse weather conditions, delays in procurement of materials and delays caused by other contractors working on the site at the same time.
While it is reasonable that the builder should be able to claim additional cost in some of these circumstances, this is not the case for all delay events; eg, those delay events which you would be expected to manage as the main/head contractor. There should also be transparency and consultation in relation to these additional costs and mitigation measures that can be taken.
Utilities and unforeseen site conditions
Most contracts state that clients will be responsible for providing details as to the location of utilities on the site. If the utilities are not in the locations identified, then you as the builder can claim additional costs incurred as a result. It is therefore important to ensure that clients provide accurate information in this regard or, if you are to be responsible for locating utilities, then the contract needs to be amended to reflect this.
Builders can usually claim additional costs in the event the physical site conditions are not those which a reasonable builder would have expected to encounter. If there are concerns about site conditions, then give a recommendation to your client to obtain site reports prior to entering in to the contract.
Provisional sums
Provisional sums are used in contracts to provide an estimate of the cost of elements of the works, where those elements cannot be fully priced at the time of signing. This may be because no final decision has been made as to what precisely will be required for those elements; eg, it has not been decided exactly what kitchen fixtures are wanted.
The fewer provisional sum elements there are in a contract, the less scope there is for price increases. As such, it should be seen how many of these can be fixed prior to signing and decisions as to fixtures and fittings should be made early on.
Conclusion
There are many reasons why the price of a ‘fixed price’ contract can change. This can cause real issues for builders and clients, as clients may struggle to obtain additional funding if costs increase and builders get left with an unpaid invoice. It is therefore important to fully understand the contract that both parties are entering into and seek legal advice to assist with negotiation of these terms.

This issue, Under Construction looks at three cases of tradies and clients who ended up before the Disputes Tribunal and how each scenario played out
A painter who took a client to the Disputes Tribunal was awarded $5,500 – but still ended up $6,704 short of the quoted price for the job.
The individual, who quoted $16,204 to paint a two-bedroom home, took action after the client refused to pay more than $4,000, claiming the price was grossly excessive despite agreeing to the quote initially. The Disputes Tribunal found that the job was overpriced after additional quotes were gathered for comparison purposes. The painter sourced two additional quotes at $11,771 and $13,961. The client sourced four additional quotes which came in at $5,060, $3,722, $3,850 and $6,210.
Despite noting that the tribunal didn’t exist to ‘rescue people from possibly bad bargains’, it intervened after being presented with the range of quotes.
“Having considered all the relative evidence placed before me, I consider that the figures advanced by the respondent (the client) are more genuinely indicative of the market range of prices for a paint job such as this,” said the Dispute Tribunal.
The tribunal found that the original quote was ‘excessive, unfair and unreasonable’ and that the contract price was ‘unconscionable’, and as a result, was able to change the terms of the contract.
The respondent, the homeowner, was ordered to pay an extra $5,500 – taking the total price to $9,500, but still far below the $16,204 initial quote.
Painting a misrepresented picture
Another dispute was brought against a painter in early 2021 by a former client. After describing himself as a Master Painter, but without being a Registered Master Painter New Zealand member, he was accused of misrepresenting himself and of breach of contract.
The individual failed to complete the contracted job, despite purchasing materials and commencing work, and so the client, who had already paid the painter $6,900, took him to tribunal to secure a full refund. The Dispute Tribunal found that, in addition to not completing the work, he had misrepresented himself by calling himself a master painter, and breached contract by failing to complete the work, and ordered him to refund $2,092.93.
In this case, the Disputes Tribunal said: “I find that approximately half of five-eighths of the house had been completed. This takes into account the full chemical wash, water blasting of the lower level, and the painting of three coats on half of the lower level. Therefore, the applicants have received the benefit of $3,807.07, plus the $1,000.00 of materials, giving a total benefit of $4,807.07.”
Listen to the client
In another case, a builder who failed to lay the correct coloured bricks – despite the homeowner paying more for a ‘Roman Grey Blend’ brick and questioning if the correct product was being laid – was ordered to pay the client $3,000.
The decision found that, although the bricks laid weren’t those ordered by the client, the only negative impact on the client was ‘aesthetics’ and that the error ‘is unlikely to affect the actual value of the house.’
However, the Tribunal felt the client deserved ‘compensation for the disappointment’ and ordered the builder to refund $2,000 for the bricks purchased, as the cost for the ‘Roman Grey Blend’ ‘was more than just a standard brick.’
It also ordered the builder to pay another $1,000 ‘to compensate for what appears to have been a continued and unreasonable insistence… that the right bricks were laid’.

In previous articles we have discussed the common causes of construction disputes and suggested steps to avoid those disputes. Unfortunately, sometimes a dispute cannot be resolved and further action needs to be taken
T he Construction Contracts Act 2002 (Act), which covers both commercial and residential construction contracts, provides a process for dealing with payments and disputes.
The Construction Contracts Amendment Act 2015 was passed in December last year and amended the Act in three areas in a staged process. The first amendment removed the differences between residential and commercial contracts, allowing parties to residential construction contracts full access to the Act’s dispute resolution process.
One of these dispute resolution methods is adjudication, designed to provide a fast and cost-effective method of determining the dispute. It is a legal process in which an adjudicator reviews evidence (including relevant documents and written statements) and written legal arguments, as set forth by opposing parties.
It is the method favoured by the Act, on the basis that it is intended to provide a fast and cost-effective process that allows the parties to maintain their cash flow while the dispute is resolved.
When should it be used?
Adjudication should only be used if the dispute cannot be resolved by discussing the issue with the other party. For example, adjudication may be the best next step if the parties to a construction contract disagree on the following:
Whether an amount is payable under the contract (for example a progress payment).
The reasons given for non-payment of an amount due.
Whether there has been a breach of a term of the contract.
Nothing in the Act prevents the parties to a construction contract from submitting a dispute to another dispute resolution procedure – eg, to court, to a tribunal or to mediation.
However, an adjudicator must terminate the adjudication proceedings if, before the adjudicator determines a dispute, that dispute is determined under any other resolution procedure.
The adjudication process
Although adjudication may be daunting to the uninitiated, the key steps under the Act are relatively straightforward and easily understood.
However, the timeframes are short. If you are making a claim (the claimant), you should ensure that you are well prepared before submitting the claim to adjudication.
If you are responding to a claim (the respondent), it is essential that you get advice straight away. If you delay, you will risk not being able to comply with the required timeframes.
The key steps in an adjudication process under the Act are:
The claimant will serve written notice of their intention to refer a dispute for adjudication (the Notice of Adjudication) on the respondent.
Within five working days of serving the notice, the claimant should request an agreed adjudicator. If an adjudicator cannot be agreed upon, then a nominating body (as may be set out in the contract between the parties) will select an adjudicator. If a nominating body is not set out in the contract, an Authorised Nominating Authority (ANA) can be requested to select an adjudicator.
Once selected, the adjudicator must indicate their ability within two working days of the request that they are willing to act. The adjudicator’s acceptance must be confirmed to the claimant and the respondent.
The claimant then has five working days after the adjudicator’s notice of acceptance to submit their dispute in writing, specifying what the dispute is over and any other documents supporting the claimant’s claim.
Within five working days of the claimant putting the dispute in writing, the respondent must submit a written response. If they do not file a response, the adjudication will continue anyway. The respondent may request an extension of time to file their response.
Once the response has been filed and served, a claimant may serve a written reply to the response within five working days. An adjudicator can refuse to consider any new material or issues raised in the reply, or they can allow the respondent up to two working days to serve a ‘rejoinder’ (a reply to the claimant’s reply).
The adjudicator will then investigate the matter and may request further details from the parties and/or call a conference if required. Often an adjudicator will decide that they are going to determine the dispute on the papers (without a hearing). However, they could also decide that a hearing should be held. The parties must cooperate with this process.
After the investigation is finished, the adjudicator will issue a written determination outlining their reasons. This is normally within 20 days of when the respondent’s response was due, but can be extended to 30 days if the contract parties agree.
Appeals
Adjudicator determinations are interim decisions – the dispute can still be pursued through the court or arbitration. However, anecdotal evidence suggests that adjudication is often the final step in many disputes.
Another key advantage of adjudication is that, unlike a court decision, it can remain confidential between the parties.
There are strict timeframes to comply with under the Act. These timeframes are there for a reason, but as a result a respondent needs to get advice as soon as possible if they are served with a Notice of Adjudication.
Claimants should make sure that they are well prepared before submitting a claim to adjudication.

Are you using NZS 3915 – A Contractor’s Construction Contract ? Know what it means for you
What’s my right to a variation under the contract? When do I have to pay this Payment Schedule? Who’s responsible for insuring materials on the site? How do we resolve this dispute?
These sorts of questions pop up around building sites all over New Zealand every day. But for Contractors (builders) and Principals (clients) without a written construction contract, finding answers is often more challenging than the project works themselves.
As discussed in previous articles, the government has recently passed an amendment to the Building Act 2004 to help parties answer these sorts of questions. As a result, it will soon be mandatory for certain types of construction work to have a written contract. It is expected that this amendment will be in force by the end of this year (see our article More than a Handshake – November 2013 – for more details).
Now is the best time for Contractors and Principals alike to get up to speed on these changes, and to learn about the types of contracts used in the industry. In this month’s article, we will discuss construction contract – NZS 3915:2005 .
NZS 3915:2005 is a standard construction contract designed for situations where no person is appointed to act as Engineer to the Contract.
NZS 3915 removes this traditional supervisor role and replaces the Engineer with a Principal’s Representative – meaning the client or the client’s chosen appointed person will need to manage the work directly. This change has significant effect on the contractual processes for payments, variations, extensions of time and dispute resolution.
It’s important to note NZS 3915:2005 is based on NZS 3910: 2003 , not the new NZS 3910: 2013 . The changes made in the new NZS 3910:2013 (mostly used for larger, commercial projects) have not been brought across to NZS 3915 (mostly used for smaller, residential projects). It is unclear when NZS 3915 will next be reviewed by Standards New Zealand.
NZS 3915 is not as widely used by the industry as NZS 3910 , but is more commonly used in smaller residential projects as opposed to larger, commercial ones. Principals often perceive this contract to be ‘contractor friendly’, so it’s not always a first choice. However, NZS 3915 does still have a place as a standard form construction contract. The document can be useful where:
There are financial and practical drivers for not using an Engineer, such as where the project is small, and it is more cost-effective for the Principal not to appoint an Engineer and to administer the Contract themselves; or
The Principal is a skilled project manager with appropriate competencies.
Under NZS 3915 , the Principal is often required to ‘step into the shoes’ that would normally be filled by the Engineer, in order to administer the contract. It  is vital that the Principal understands his/her contractual obligations before the works commence. The deadlines for specific actions in NZS 3915 are absolute; failure to comply with them can have cost and time implications for the Principal.
Some of the key areas for Contractors and Principals to keep an eye on are:
As mentioned above, the Principal must nominate a Principal’s Representative to act on his/her behalf. This person performs duties on behalf of the Principal, including, among other things, giving directions and instructions to the Contractor.
The Contractor must deal with the Principal’s Representative in the same way as they would the Engineer under NZS 3910 . However, it is important for Contractors to understand that the Principal’s Representative is under no obligation to act independently, impartially or fairly when administering the contract, unlike the obligations placed on the Engineer under NZS 3910 .
It is vital for the Principal to appreciate the difference between having a Principal’s Representative and employing an Engineer to administer the contract. The amount of administration under NZS 3915 is no different than under NZS 3910 , but in NZS 3915 there is no middle man to manage the contract. The buck stops with the Principal.
As there is no Engineer undertaking the evaluation and certification process, the Principal has to carry out this role his/herself. The Principal must understand his/her obligations under the contract, and in particular, its obligation to issue Payment Schedules (which define the date payments will be made) and make payments within the prescribed time.
During the payment process, it is also critical for the Contractor to be aware of what he/she has to do both under the Contract and the Construction Contracts Act 2002 ( CCA ). In particular, the Contractor must ensure that all of his/her payment claims conform to the requirements of section 20(2) of the CCA in order to receive the protections of the Act.
Payment claims must give details about:
What work it covers.
The period the claim covers.
How much money is due.
When payment is due.
How the builder calculated the amount.
What you have to do to respond to the claim, ie how to pay.
What will happen if you don’t respond to the claim or don’t pay the amount.
The Principal may vary the Contract by written notice to the Contractor, and there are a wide range of circumstances under which variations arise. At first instance, the parties should try to agree on the value of the Variation. If the value cannot be agreed, the onus then falls on the Principal to determine the value of the Variation (after receiving the Contractor’s estimate). This is a very technical task and it is not reasonable to expect the average Principal on a residential project to carry out this exercise. A quantity surveyor or an engineer would likely be required to assist and any cost efficiencies in using NZS 3915 over NZS 3910 may quickly be eroded.
It is vital that the Principal is aware of the deadline for valuing variations. The Principal has 20 working days (from receipt of the Contractor’s estimated valuation) to determine the value of the Variation and notify the Contractor. If the Principal fails to comply with this deadline, the value proposed by the Contractor will be deemed accepted by the Principal.
With no Engineer to decide disputes arising under the Contract, the parties must instead agree on an expert to hear their dispute. Either party may refer the dispute to the expert, who will issue a determination of the issue in writing (including reasons for the decision) within the tight timeframe of the Contract. This decision is final and binding, unless it is referred to mediation or arbitration.
Despite this express contractual dispute process, nothing prevents a party referring a dispute to adjudication under the CCA at any time. Adjudication provides a fast-track dispute resolution process, which may run in tandem with the contractual processes.
“NZS 3915:2005 is a standard form construction contract designed for situations where no person is appointed to act as Engineer to the Contract
NZS 3915 is an attractive contract form for contractors. Whilst the obligations of the Contractor remain very similar to those of NZS 3910 , ignorance or poor administrative processes on behalf of the Principal can lead to ‘contractor friendly’ results.
However, if the Principal (your client) is asking for advice on which contract to use, and they are new to the construction process, it may be worth suggesting they use a contract that requires less administration and oversight from them, as this could lead to costly mistakes.
The new NZS 3910:2013 or NZS 3916:2013 (Design and Construct) contracts are preferable for larger jobs and both can be used un-amended for most projects. For an inexperienced Principal, the ‘buffer’ and expertise of a professional in the Engineer’s role can be money well spent.
If the Contractor is a member of Registered Master Builders or the Certified Builder’s Association, one of the standard form contracts provided by them can be appropriate. These are contracts designed specifically for simple projects and most Contractors are familiar with them. From a Principal’s perspective, these contracts are still somewhat ‘contractor friendly’; however, there are fewer hazards than in NZS 3915 , which can trip up inexperienced Principals.
With construction contracts, it is usually a case of ‘horses for courses’. If you are unsure, consult a lawyer to discuss the right contract to fit with your expectations for your business or project.

Debt collection is a vital part of business. Delays in payment have an impact on cash flow and it’s therefore critical your debt collection process is efficient and effective
T he process starts immediately when you form a relationship with the debtor. The terms on which you contract with the debtor can later affect proceedings when you try to recover any outstanding debt.
Every contract should be tailored to your particular business needs – one size does not fit all.
Regardless of the nature of your business, your contracts should be clearly written to avoid disputes over what was agreed. You should consider the following issues when preparing your contracts:
Is the other party accurately recorded in the contract ? Is the other party a company, a trust, an individual trading under another name or an individual ? Make sure the name of the contracting party is correct.
Be specific about the goods or services that you are providing. If there is any limitation on what you are providing, state that clearly in the contract.
Be clear about the price of the goods or services you’re providing, or how the price is to be calculated if a formula is used. What does this price include or exclude ?
Are the risk and insurance clauses, and retention of title clauses, appropriate and enforceable ?
Consider whether to limit or exclude your liability for products or services to the extent that you are able to in law (there are some obligations in law that you cannot contract out of).
Check that there is a clause in the contract allowing you to charge interest on overdue accounts. Recording on invoices or statements that interest will be charged on overdue accounts may not be enforceable. Ensure that the method of calculating the interest is simple to apply.
Where the debtor is a company or a trust, get a personal guarantee from a director or trustee.
It’s important that you review your contracts regularly to ensure they are up to date. Include any changes to the law or any changes to your business practices.
The contract should be signed by the other party before the goods or services are provided. This avoids any disputes about whether the terms of the contract apply.
After the contract is signed, make sure that you:
Register any security interest on the Personal Property Securities Register (PPSR).
Manage the contract tightly and proactively – do not let overdue accounts sit dormant for long periods.
Record any variations to the contract terms in writing.
If you are having difficulty recovering a debt, the first step is to communicate with the debtor – why are they not paying and should you continue to provide them with goods and services while the debt is outstanding ?
Before pursuing the debtor, you should check to see whether they have any assets or other means of paying. Find out if they own any property and check the PPSR to see if any creditors have a security interest over their property.
If there is a dispute over an amount sought in a payment claim, and if the reasons for not paying for the claimed amount have been included in a valid payment schedule, the adjudication procedure in the CCA can be used.
Recovering debt from individuals
If the debt is disputed, you can file a claim against the debtor in the Disputes Tribunal for claims under $15,000 (or up to $20,000 if the debtor agrees). If the debt is not disputed, you cannot file your claim in the Disputes Tribunal.
If the debt is under $200,000, you can file a claim in the District Court. If the debt is over $200,000, you will need to file a claim in the High Court. If the debtor does not file a statement of defence within 25 working days of being served with the statement of claim, you can apply for default judgment.
Once you have obtained judgment against an individual, you have several options:
Obtain an attachment order to salary or wages for the debt to be paid in instalments.
Obtain a charging order over property owned by the debtor.
Obtain a sale order in respect of the debtor’s property.
Apply to bankrupt the debtor.
Recovering debt from a company
If a company owes you an outstanding debt, the first step is to serve a letter of demand. If that letter of demand is not complied with and the debt is not disputed, a statutory demand can be served on the debtor, which requires payment to be made within 15 working days.
If the statutory demand is not complied with, you can apply to liquidate the company. If the debtor is a company, you should also look to pursue the guarantor in respect of the debt.
Collecting your debts promptly after issuing invoices results in healthy cash flow. It is essential to ensure that your processes are effective right from the beginning of the contract to the debt collection process itself.
It’s important to remember that clear and well-written contracts combined with good communication are essential to the debt collection process.

Covid-19 has generated a lot of change in a short space of time, but as Duncan Cotterill explains, employers and employees are still bound by their pre-Covid legal obligations
Earlier this year, when New Zealand entered a nationwide lockdown, businesses grappled with urgent and challenging employment decisions. Employment issues triggered by that lockdown are now being decided by the Employment Relations Authority (Authority) and it is likely that further appeals will be made to the Employment Court. These cases serve as a reminder of continuing employment obligations and what to be mindful of in your own employment dealings.
YOUR OBLIGATIONS REMAIN THE SAME
Although both employers and employees faced, and continue to face, increased pressure due to Covid-19, overarching employment obligations have not changed. Both parties bear the same legal obligations as before the pandemic. The Authority has confirmed that the lockdown and the continuing challenges of Covid-19 has not created a “free pass” for employees or employers, who fall short of their responsibilities.
Every employment relationship is governed by the principle of good faith. This requires employers and employees to be active and constructive in maintaining the employment relationship by being responsive and communicative with each other. Neither party should seek to mislead or deceive the other. The employer must also provide the employee with sufficient information, and the ability to comment on that information, before the employer makes a decision that may adversely impact the continuation of the employee’s employment.
MINIMUM RESPONSIBILITIES AND RIGHTS
Under New Zealand employment law, employers and employees both have rights and responsibilities.
Employer responsibilities include:
Paying employees in accordance with their employment contract (and at least minimum wage).
Not deducting money from wages unlawfully.
Giving employees at least four weeks’ paid annual holiday.
Giving employees the day off on public holidays, or giving them an alternative holiday if they work (and if an employee works on a public holiday, paying them at least time and a half).
Giving employees at least five days’ sick leave annually.
Providing a safe workplace.
Providing rest and meal breaks.
Acting in good faith and honesty.
Employee responsibilities include:
Being at work and being willing to work at the agreed time(s).
Following all reasonable and lawful requests.
Exercising reasonable care, skill and knowledge.
Exercising reasonable behaviour.
Keeping yourself and others safe when you are at work.
Acting in good faith and honesty.
RECENT CASE LAW
Sandhu v Gate Gourmet New Zealand Ltd is a recent case that dealt with pay obligations and the minimum wage during the first Covid-19 lockdown. Gate Gourmet New Zealand Limited (Gate), the employer, was an essential service. Gate had acted in good faith and obtained the employees’ agreement to receiving 80% of their normal pay, with the option to use leave to supplement their income back to 100%, during lockdown.
At the time the agreement was made, all of their employees were on the minimum wage.  On 1 April 2020, the minimum wage increased to $756/week for full-time employees. While Gate increased their employees’ normal pay by the minimum wage increase, because of the agreement to only receive 80% of their normal pay, the employees were only receiving $604.80/week.
The Authority did not accept “no work, no pay” arguments and found that Gate could not pay what would amount to less than the legal minimum wage for full-time workers. It also rejected arguments that the employees were not able to work or should only receive partial remuneration for partial performance, as Gate had instructed the employees not to come to work.
In summary, even though the employees had agreed to be paid at 80%, Gate was not legally able to pay them less than the minimum wage. The Authority ordered Gate to repay the difference between what the employees had been paid and the minimum wage.
REDUNDANCY AND RESTRUCTURING
The significant impact of Covid-19 on New Zealand businesses has meant that many employers have had to consider restructuring and redundancies. In all circumstances, any termination on the grounds of redundancy must be justified substantively and be procedurally fair.
Employers should consider whether their actions are what a fair and reasonable employer could have done in the circumstances at the time. Covid-19 provides no excuse to avoid these responsibilities or make a hasty decision.
A genuine reason may be:
A significant downturn in sales or revenue.
A loss of customers or suppliers.
A shift in market requirements.
These reasons should be well-documented and have evidence to support them.
A fair process includes:
Acting in good faith.
Complying with the terms of employment agreements and policies.
Being open, communicative and constructive.
Documenting the employer’s business case, reasons and proposals.
Providing all relevant information to employees.
Giving employees a reasonable opportunity to consider and respond to any proposals.
Considering alternatives such as varying the terms of their employment.
Genuinely taking the employees’ responses into account before coming to a decision.
RECENT CASE LAW
De Wys v Solly’s Freight (1987) Limited serves as a reminder to employers of the importance that there is a substantive justification for a redundancy, as well as a fair process, even during Covid-19.
The employer, Solly’s Freight (1987) Limited (Solly’s) applied for the Government Wage Subsidy (GWS) and for registration as an essential service during the first lockdown. However, only some of Solly’s usual services were deemed essential. In response to its reduced operations, the company initiated a restructuring process, which, among other measures, led to the dismissal of a number of permanent employees by way of redundancy.
The Authority found that there had been no consultation with employees and that there was no evidence Solly’s had taken any action to retain staff, despite signing the GWS Declaration, which required employers to make their “best endeavours” to keep staff in employment. In response, the Authority awarded two former employees a combined pay-out of $58,039 for lost wages and compensation for their unjustified redundancies.

The Government is considering merging Building Consent Authorities (BCAs) to create larger regional BCAs for improved consistency and efficiency during the consent issuing process
The Government wants to make New Zealand’s building consent system more efficient and consistent across the country.
To do so, it will investigate a “more consistent and streamlined model” that reduces the number of Building Consent Authorities (BCAs) and creates a single point of contact for consent applications, said Building and Construction minister Chris Penk.
“There are currently 67 BCAs across the country, each with different practices and approaches. We have a single Building Code that is supposed to apply consistently to all building work nationally. However, there are many instances of builders submitting the exact same plans to different BCAs and finding considerable additional costs and delays resulting from differing interpretations of the Building Code.
“This is especially challenging for large-scale home builders and off-site manufacturers, along with modular and prefab builders, who work across regional boundaries. For example, in a recent survey of Master Builders Association members, 80% reported having to deal with multiple BCAs and 66% experienced delays.”
To establish a more consistent national model, Penk said options under consideration include:
Voluntary consolidation – allowing councils to group together to deliver building control functions. Some are already pooling resources but face barriers to full integration. This approach will focus on removing those barriers.
Regional BCAs – establishing a smaller number of relatively large regional BCAs to replace the current 66 district and city council BCAs. This approach focuses on improving consistency and forming entities with the critical mass to drive economies of scale.
Single point of contact – setting up a single point of contact for builders to submit plans to. Building inspection may be contracted out to existing BCAs or private consenting providers, creating competition and encouraging specialisation.
Additionally, the Government is looking at “liability settings” across the whole building system to encourage less risk-averse decision-making from BCAs.
“Under the current settings, councils and their ratepayers are liable for defective work,” said Penk. “Joint and several liability means councils can be ‘the last person standing’ to foot the bill when things go wrong. This creates a highly conservative and risk-averse approach, which contributes cost and draws out deadlines.”
The decision to look at liability goes hand in hand with the Government’s proposed crackdown on phoenixing (when directors of a failed company set up a new company with a similar name, staff and assets to the failed one).
Responding to the news on NewstalkZB , New Zealand Certified Builders Chief Executive Malcolm Fleming provided cautious support.
“There’s a lack of detail [in the announcement] but [we support] the idea of merging large metro and small regional BCAs. Merging would create greater local capacity and, at the moment, consent application levels are a little lower but will start to go up in the next couple of years, so the Government is right to be looking at this now,” he said.

Changes to the Fair Trading Act prohibiting the inclusion of unfair contract terms are now in effect. As such, you need to be mindful of any fine print incorporated into standard-form consumer contracts and understand what the changes mean for your business
Most people involved in the building industry should now be familiar with the requirements for written contracts to be provided for residential building work costing $30,000 or more (GST included). Contractors must also provide checklists and disclose certain information when requested.
Although the new requirements provide default clauses that will apply automatically if a written contract doesn’t include the minimum content required, businesses should be mindful of any fine print incorporated into such contracts.
In one of the biggest changes to consumer protection law in recent times, a new regime applies under the Fair Trading Act 1986, as of 17 March. The changes prohibit including unfair terms in standard-form consumer contracts, including written contracts for residential building work.
These changes are equally important to both consumers and businesses.
The prohibition of unfair contract terms will apply to any industry that uses a ‘standard-form consumer contract’, when providing goods or services of a kind that are ordinarily acquired for personal, domestic or household use or consumption.
Standard-form consumer contracts are contracts that are not usually negotiated between parties, and where one party (generally the business), would give consumers a pre-prepared contract to sign before the goods or services are provided. These contracts are generally offered on a ‘take it or leave it’ basis; typically, the same contract would be used for all of the businesses’ customers. Any pre-prepared contract or standard terms of trade are likely to be standard-form consumer contracts.
The way in which the prohibition on unfair contract terms will work is that it allows a consumer to make a complaint to the Commerce Commission, alleging that a contract’s terms are unfair. It will then be up to the Commerce Commission to investigate and, if considered appropriate, apply to a court for a declaration that a particular term, or terms, used in a standard-form consumer contract are ‘unfair’.
“The prohibition on unfair contract terms will apply to any industry, which uses a ‘standard form consumer contract’, when providing a service or product to a consumer
Providing a definitive answer to what might be considered an unfair contract term is beyond the scope of this article; however, there are three factors a court will consider in determining whether a term or terms of a contract are unfair. These are:
The term causes ‘significant imbalance’ in the rights and obligations of the parties arising under the contract.
The term is not reasonably necessary to protect the legitimate interest of the party who would be advantaged by it.
The term would cause detriment (financial or otherwise) to a party if it were applied, enforced or relied upon.
A court can also consider any matter that it thinks relevant, but must take into account the contract as a whole and the extent to which the term is “transparent”.
It is also important to note that some terms of a contract cannot be declared unfair. These include the main subject matter (ie the goods or services being provided), the upfront price or any term expressly permitted by law.
If you have, or are currently using, a standard-form written contract for residential building work, you may wish to review it. The Act provides a list of things to look out for, including clauses that allow or have the effect of permitting one party to unilaterally:
Vary the terms of the contract.
Avoid or limit performance of the contract.
Terminate the contract.
Penalise another party for breaching or ending the contract.
Renew or not renew the contract.
Vary the price payable under the contract without the right of another party to terminate the contract.
Vary the characteristics of the goods or services to be supplied under the contract.
Determine whether the contract has been breached, or interpret its meaning.
If in doubt, seek advice.
If you use a standard-form consumer contract to provide residential building work, you will need to keep abreast of the legislation for ‘unfair’ contractual terms. You may also need to conduct a periodic review of your contracts. There are plenty of commercial incentives to get your contracting process and terms right. Potential fines are up to $600,000 for companies and $200,000 for individuals, if a party continues to use or enforce an unfair contract term.

TITLE   : RECOVERING THE COSTS OF COVID

As restrictions ease and construction projects resume, the scale of impact from COVID-19 on the construction industry may become starkly apparent
Faced with extra costs, delays, supply chain disruptions and problems with your personnel, what steps can you take to calculate and recover costs or come to a new agreement?
A. CALCULATE YOUR COSTS
You may have increased costs as a result of COVID-19 and the ensuing lockdown, including:
Demobilising and then remobilising staff and projects.
Extra hire costs for tools or on-site equipment (such as scaffolding).
Complying with relevant health and safety measures.
Off-site storage costs or other costs in relation to delays in the supply chain.
Damage to the site due to inaccessibility of the site.
Personnel and staff issues.
Inability to progress due to delays in consents or approvals.
Extra costs needed for the acceleration of work after the lockdown.
Calculating the value of the costs incurred will be a complex and context-dependent exercise. Ensure your calculations are evidenced by diligently recording funds and correspondence. Both increases and decreases in costs should be considered, including wage subsidies and other government support.
B. REVIEW YOUR CONTRACT: WHAT COSTS CAN YOU RECOVER?
For NZS3910:2013 contracts, if the engineer issued a suspension notice under clause 6.7.1, then the contractor is entitled to a variation under clause 6.7.3. If a suspension notice was not issued, the contractor is still entitled to a variation of the contract under clause 5.11.10.
Other contract forms may also provide for variations due to unforeseen events (which would include a pandemic). In other cases, you may be able to come to an agreement between the parties to vary the contract.
In any case, the increase in costs that are being claimed as a variation must be reasonable and reflect the actual increase in expense or direct cost to the contractor or subcontractor incurred in performing the contract because of the lockdown. This is unlikely to include costs associated with idle labour.
C. REVIEW YOUR CONTRACT: WHAT TIMEFRAMES APPLY?
Make sure you are aware of the timeframes and procedures that may apply to submitting claims and/or notices. Working in accordance with the terms of the contract help to eliminate disputes later on.
It is also important that payment claims, and payment schedules are issued on time and comply with the Construction Contracts Act 2002. Specific information must go into those documents or they will be ineffective.
D. OPEN THE LINES OF COMMUNICATION
The most cost-effective and efficient method of recovering any additional costs is to communicate openly with the other parties and work collaboratively to come to an agreement. Engage in discussions early and proactively to find a mutually beneficial solution. Consider:
Evidence: provide evidence and justification for any increase in costs – while also disclosing decreases in costs.
Mitigate: show where you have mitigated delays and costs where possible.
Cooperate: act cooperatively with all parties through every step of the contract – this includes head contractors passing on benefits to subcontractors and suppliers.
If you come to an agreement, record it in writing to prevent future disputes.
E. CONSIDER CASHFLOW
Parties may also want to consider agreeing to alternative cashflow arrangements to ensure a project continues. Alternative arrangements could include:
Advances: principals could advance payments for materials, works or even variations that have not been fully valued yet.
Payment cycles: parties could agree to shorter payment cycles (e.g. weekly or fortnightly compared to monthly).
Retentions: releasing or reducing retentions or bonds.
Again, if you come to an agreement, record it in writing to prevent future disputes.
If you cannot agree to any of the above and you are facing solvency issues, you should familiarise yourself with the changes the Government has introduced. These changes have been designed to support businesses struggling from the impact of COVID-19 and the Government-imposed lockdown. More on this can be found in previous Under Construction May issue online.
F. GET LEGAL ADVICE
If you are unable to come to an agreement with the other parties, speak with a lawyer to carefully review your options going forward. In most cases, increased costs and delays are unlikely to be enough to create frustration with a contract, and you should seek legal advice before terminating your agreement.
There are many options available to resolve disputes and/or get paid, including mediation, adjudication, and/or preparing a statutory demand. Our next article will cover these options in more detail.

To help strengthen the residential development sector, the Government has announced a Residential Development Underwrite (RDU) scheme to increase developers’ access to finance
To combat the twin threats of high interest rates and low building consents, the RDU will help support residential construction activity in the near-term and will ensure a supply of new homes to market when interest rates drop and buyers re-enter the market.
“In times of expensive borrowing, underwrites are an effective tool for supporting housing supply,” said Housing Minister Chris Bishop.
“This is because underwrites increase developers’ access to finance, where they otherwise wouldn’t have been able to get it and therefore wouldn’t have been able to deliver the houses.”
Increased confidence
Building and Construction minister Chris Penk added that the RDU is designed to ‘prime the pump’ during tricky economic conditions.
“While the mood on the ground has started to shift with some encouraging signs of renewed optimism, the new underwrite will provide important support and confidence to the building and construction sector during a tough economic period.”
However, the RDU won’t be available to all builders. Only companies delivering developments at scale can apply. New entries into the market won’t be able to take advantage of the scheme either, added Penk.
“For a development to be approved for the underwrite, it must have a minimum of 30 houses. The developer must have a proven track record of successfully building and selling houses of a similar size and scale, have ownership or use of the land (or an option to do so), and have all the required resource consents for residential housing.
“In addition to providing a recent market valuation from a registered valuer, the developer must also be able to provide satisfactory evidence that underwrites are needed for the development to proceed within 6-12 months – for example, evidence that reasonable attempts have been made to market the development, that finance approval is conditional on pre-sales, and that the required workforce is available. There will be no price caps or eligible buyer restrictions.”
Re-hash of old ideas?
This isn’t the first time a government has underwritten the construction industry. The previous Labour Government introduced an underwrite as part of KiwiBuild in 2018 and the RDU will use unallocated funds from KiwiBuild and BuildReady Development.
Labour’s housing spokesperson Kieran McAnulty said thousands of builders could have been kept in the workforce had National not scrapped KiwiBuild and BuildReady Development.
“Over the past few months, thousands of construction workers have lost their jobs. Maintaining a government underwrite through this period would have helped some of them keep their job.”

The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) is seeking feedback on a range of options to increase the uptake of remote inspections and improve efficiency and productivity in the building inspection process.
In September, Under Construction reported that MBIE was planning to run a public consultation on the Government’s plan to make it a requirement for Building Consent Authorities (BCAs) to use remote inspections as the default approach to cut costs and improve build times. That consultation is now under way.
“A constant frustration getting in the way of building is the cumbersome consenting system and building inspections, which are carried out to ensure a build is compliant with the Building Code,” said Minister for Building and Construction Chris Penk at the time it was announced.
However, Simon Thomas, MBIE Head of Building System Delivery and Assurance, stressed that the pace of change would be more sedate than Penk suggested.
“While the Government has indicated it is exploring a range of options to increase the uptake of remote inspections, onsite inspections remain standard practice for BCAs.”
As a result, MBIE is seeking feedback on options which include:
Requiring BCAs to use remote inspections as the default approach.
Requiring BCAs to have the systems and capability to conduct remote inspections.
Non-regulatory initiatives to lift inspection productivity.
Creating a new offence to deter deceptive behaviour during a remote inspection and give building consent authorities more confidence to inspect remotely.
The consultation also seeks feedback on increasing the use of Accredited Organisations (Building) to undertake inspections – private organisations, which can process consent applications on behalf of BCAs.
People who wish to make a submission can do so by completing an online survey, completing the submission form template found HERE and emailing it to building@mbie.govt.nz or by mailing it to:

It’s important to be aware of the difference in law between a contractor and an employee, and whether the relationship with your contractors has progressed to the next level.
S ubcontracting and labour-only contracting are common in building and construction industries and can be a convenient, efficient way of engaging labour. However, there can be hidden risks with such practices.
Simply labelling an agreement as an “independent contractor agreement” does not, of itself, determine the relationship’s legal status. Although it is still important to get the documentation right, the real nature of the relationship in practice will be the key factor.
If a contractor’s status is successfully challenged and they are found to be an employee, the employer may be faced with serious ramifications. For example, if the employer decided to terminate the engagement without cause (which is a common feature of an independent contractor agreement), a successful unjustifiable dismissal claim could be brought by the worker.
The employer would then be liable for accrued holiday pay, sick and bereavement leave dating back up to six years. The employer would also need to account for unpaid PAYE deductions to the Inland Revenue Department and potentially pay a penalty and interest for late payment.
The courts consider a number of factors when determining whether an employment relationship exists. In essence, people who are classified as contractors, but who are closely controlled and directed by a principal and/or are integrated into the principal’s business and/or are not performing services as a business on their own account may (if they challenge their status) be held at law to be employees.
“If a contractor’s status is successfully challenged, and they are foudn to be an employee, the employe maybe faced with serious ramifications
It is important in each case to balance all the circumstances of the relationship between the parties, in order to determine the true status of the worker.
Set hours and days of work.
Receiving payment for overtime.
Being provided with a company vehicle and using the company’s tools and equipment.
Not being able to profit from managing work efficiently.
Being subject to a high degree of control over day-to-day activities.
Being subject to PAYE and other deductions such as ACC levies required to be made by the employer.
Being bound to one employer and not being permitted to compete/offer skills to another employer.
Being registered for GST purposes and personally responsible for ACC levies and all other insurance and tax responsibilities.
Providing own equipment.
Meeting own fuel costs.
Having no guarantee of any particular level of work.
Ability to earn greater levels of income depending upon availability of work.
Work being performed not being integral to the main business of the company.
Ability to provide services to different organisations.
Ability to make a greater profit from the manner in which one’s own time and affairs are organised.
Being required to remedy defective work at their own cost.
We recommend you undertake a review of your existing contractor arrangements to satisfy yourself that there are no potential issues as to the contractor’s status.
“The courts consider a number of factors when determining whether an employment relationship exists
We also recommend, when engaging a contractor, that the parties enter into an appropriately worded agreement, which properly reflects how the relationship will operate. Although the nature of an independent contractor’s relationship can ‘evolve’ over time, care needs to be taken that this evolution does not result in an employment relationship.

Do you remember the animated TV show Bob the Builder? What you may not recall is his young apprentice, Leo, a college student who works for Bob from time to time. While Bob appreciates the extra pair of hands, deciding whether to treat Leo as an employee or contractor gives him a headache
This is an important decision for any business owner, but is particularly relevant for builders given the nature of the construction industry. Determining the employment status of your staff will affect the statutory rights and protections afforded to them under the Employment Relations Act 2000 (the Act), so it’s important you get it right.
For example, employees are entitled to the minimum wage, annual holidays, public holidays, paid sick leave, bereavement leave and protection from unjustifiable actions and unjustifiable dismissal.
What’s the difference?
In New Zealand, Section 6 of the Act sets out the test for determining whether a worker is considered an employee. It states that an individual is an employee if they are employed to do any work for hire or reward under a ‘contract of service’ by the employer.
Section 6 also says that, in deciding whether a person is employed under a ‘contract of service’, the Court or Authority would look at the real nature of the relationship between the parties. This is a broad section, which provides the Court or Authority considerable scope to decide the matter in the event of a dispute. Over time, the courts have developed a number of tests to differentiate between employees and contractors. These tests are not determinative, but they provide a useful guide.
The intention test
If Leo entered into an agreement with Bob that expressly stated he was a contractor, this may indicate that the intention of the parties is for Leo to operate as a self-employed worker. While this is important when ascertaining the true nature of the parties’ relationship, it is not a conclusive test, as the agreement reflects only what the parties originally intended the work relationship to look like.
However, it does not necessarily reflect the real ongoing nature of the relationship. Occasionally, a working relationship that began as a principal-contractor relationship may morph into an employment relationship. Therefore, even if Leo is expressly named as a contractor in the agreement, if the nature of the relationship changes over time, Leo can become an employee.
Control vs independence test
The greater the control Leo has over his work and when he performs the work, the more likely it is that he is a contractor. On the other hand, if Bob largely controls what Leo does for the business and how he does it, he is more likely to be considered an employee.
Factors that may indicate a high level of independence include if Leo chooses:
The type of work that he does.
The amount of time he spends working.
His hours.
When he goes on holiday.
If, however, Bob had continuous and detailed control over Leo and required Leo to be at work for set hours on set days, apply for leave to go on holiday, and/or was always under the supervision of Bob or another while at work, this would indicate that Leo was an employee.
Integration test
If Leo and his work are highly integrated into Bob’s building company, it is more likely he would be considered an employee. For example, if the work Leo undertakes is integral to the running of Bob’s building business, this would suggest that Leo is an employee.
Work undertaken by a contractor is generally supplementary to the business, rather than an integral part. Other questions that should be asked as part of the integration test include:
Does Leo work with his own equipment?
Is he paid for what he produces rather than by the hour?
If the answer is yes to one or both of those questions, it would be more likely that Leo is a contractor.
Fundamental/economic reality test
When looking at the parties’ relationship as a whole, several factors may indicate the economic reality. For example, if Leo is paid a salary or a wage, and if Bob’s building company processes PAYE tax and ACC on Leo’s behalf, then this would weigh in favour of Leo being considered an employee.
If, however, Leo pays tax directly to Inland Revenue, is able to engage other workers to perform his work (through sub-contracting or employing his own staff), is entitled to the profits and is responsible for any losses from his work, this would suggest that Leo is a contractor
Why does it matter?
An employer must provide employees with the minimum standards set out in legislation, such as the Employment Relations Act 2000, Minimum Wage Act 1983 and the Holidays Act 2003. A contractor, however, is technically a self-employed individual and would not be covered by most employment laws and statutory entitlements.
This could affect Leo in several ways. For example, he would not be paid annual leave or sick leave, unless it was expressly provided for in his services agreement. Further, he would not be able to bring a personal grievance if he was dismissed and he may have to arrange to pay his own taxes.
If Bob’s building company wrongly treated Leo as a contractor rather than an employee, this could have adverse financial effects for Bob and his business. For example, they may be liable to pay costs such as unpaid PAYE tax, unpaid minimum wages and holidays and leave entitlements if they incorrectly treated Leo as a contractor.
Ultimately, the key message is to ensure that all parties accurately agree the nature of the working relationship between them from the outset of the relationship.

The recent collapse of Mainzeal Property & Construction Limited – currently in receivership and liquidation – has again highlighted various issues for the construction industry, including:
• Can sub-contractors access the construction site to remove their tools and equipment?
• Who has the rights to any retention payments held by the company in receivership?
• What rights do unpaid suppliers have to goods supplied to the company in receivership but not paid for?
If you believe that any retention payment is being held on trust, then you should notify the receiver as soon as possible.
A receiver is appointed by a secured creditor, who is generally a bank. In Mainzeal’s case, the Bank of New Zealand appointed the receivers.
The receiver will often take over management of the company. Generally, receivers can either continue to trade under existing contracts on the same terms, or refuse to continue to trade, while trying to sell off the company’s business as a whole, or sell off particular assets.
A receiver generally acts for the benefit of the secured creditor only, and not in the interests of creditors generally.
In most receiverships, one of the receiver’s first tasks will be to identify who owns what. On a large construction project, this can take some time and it is not unusual for a receiver to lock everyone out of the site until they have completed that process. A receiver will be careful to avoid releasing property owned by the company in receivership and to avoid releasing property owned by one party to a third party, to avoid potential claims against the receiver.
Importantly, a receivership will generally not affect ownership of any tools and equipment owned by a subcontractor. These will usually be released by a receiver once ownership has been confirmed.
A subcontractor can assist this process by contacting the receiver and clearly identifying the items in question to be recovered and providing as much evidence of ownership as possible.
On a large development, the retention payments held by the company may be substantial. Prior to 1987, retention payments were secured by the Wages Protection and Contractors’ Lien Act 1939. However, since that Act’s repeal, this is not the case now unless it has been specifically agreed.
Unless the retention payment is held on trust, it is likely covered by the secured creditor’s security agreement. The receiver can pay that money to the secured creditor. The subcontractor, or other affected party, will then be left with an unsecured claim against the company.
There is support in some quarters for amending the Construction Contracts Act 2002, to provide protection for retention payments in the event that the Head Contractor runs into problems. However, there are no immediate plans to change the current legal position.
If you are concerned about a retention payment, you should seek immediate legal advice as to the status of that payment. If you believe that any retention payment is being held on trust, then you should notify the receiver as soon as possible.
Importantly, a receivership will generally not affect ownership of any tools and equipment owned by a subcontractor
The Personal Property Securities Act 1999 provides protection to parties, who have supplied goods to a construction company and who have not been paid (provided certain criteria are met).
If your supply contract has a retention of title clause, and you have properly registered your security interest on the Personal Property Securities Register, then your security interest in the goods supplied (and their proceeds) will generally take priority over all other security interests.
Again, you should immediately notify the receiver if you are claiming a security interest in any property under their control.
Alternatively, if you are regularly supplying goods on credit terms without having registered a security interest on the Personal Property Securities Register, you may need to consult your solicitor for advice regarding how to register on the Personal Property Securities Register.

TITLE   : Know your boundaries!

This month we look at what builders’ legal obligations are in relation to residential fencing, what the consequences are of non-compliance and some key points to take home
F Fencing disputes between neighbours are common and normally arise in relation to the cost, repair and location of fences. Fencing requirements between neighbours, and how to resolve disputes, are primarily governed by the Fencing Act 1978.
Additionally, a builder must meet their legal requirements under the Building Act 2004 when they have entered into a contract to build a fence for an owner. This is on the basis that building a fence constitutes ‘building work’ under the Building Act 2004 and such a contract to build a fence would result in a ‘residential building contract’.
Builders’ legal obligations include the following:
1. Before entering into the contract
Providing disclosure information and a checklist.
If a client requests, or the fence costs $30,000 or more, a builder must provide their client with disclosure information and a checklist before entering into the contract.
Disclosure information will provide information to a client about the builder. A checklist will provide guidance to a client on what matters he/she should take into consideration when entering into the contract to build the fence.
2. Form and content of a residential building contract:
If the fence costs $30,000 or more, the contract to build the fence must be in writing, dated and comply with any regulations made under the Building Act 2004.
3. During the contract
The builder warrants to the client that:
The building work will be carried out in a proper and competent manner, and in accordance with any requirements set out in the contract and any building consents.
The materials supplied for the building work will be fit for purpose and, unless otherwise stated, new.
The building work will comply with all legal requirements.
The building work will be carried out with reasonable care and skill and completed by the date specified. If no date is specified, the building work must be carried out within a reasonable time frame.
The building work will be reasonably fit for its intended purpose of a fence.
4. After the contract is completed
Once the fence is built, the builder must provide certain information and documentation in writing to the client:
The purpose of this information is to ensure that the owner and future owners of the fence have knowledge of ongoing maintenance requirements and who carried out the building work.
This information may include information on insurance, maintenance and guarantees.
If the building work carried out on the fence is defective and able to be remedied, the builder must remedy the defect if the client notifies them within 12 months from the completion of the building work.
Consequences of Non-Compliance with Legal Obligations
The consequences of a builder failing to comply with the legal requirements above are wide ranging and may include liability for offences, damages or compensation .
5. Offences
Failing to comply with any of the below are considered offences under the Building Act 2004:
The content and form requirements of the residential building contract (ie, enters into an unwritten contract, where it must be written).
The requirement to provide disclosure information and a checklist, before the residential contract is entered into.
The requirement to provide certain information and documentation, after the residential contract is completed.
Where a builder has failed to comply with these requirements and commits an offence, he/she will be liable to a fine not exceeding $2,000.
6. Damages and/or compensation:
Where a builder has breached any warranty owed to a client, the client may require the builder to remedy the breach (ie, repairing the work or replacing defective materials).
If the builder refuses to, or neglects to do so within a reasonable period, a client may claim costs for someone else to complete the repair work or cancel the contract. If the breach of the warranty cannot be remedied or is substantial, the client may receive compensation for the reduction in value or cancel the contract.
Despite receiving remedies for a breach of warranty or defect, a client may in some circumstances still be entitled to claim damages for loss or damage resulting from the defect or breach of warranty.
Further things to note
A building consent is required for a fence exceeding 2.5 metres in height.
A builder must still ensure the building work in relation to the fence complies with the Building Code’s requirements and any regulations, to the extent required by the Building Act 2004.
A person’s rights under the Fair Trading Act 1986 or Consumer Guarantees Act 1993 are not affected by a residential building contract.
Getting to the Point
Contracting to build a residential fence will constitute a residential building contract under the Building Act 2004. As such, a builder will owe a number of legal obligations.
This is important to remember, as these obligations and requirements are far reaching and can have wide-ranging consequences in the event of non-compliance.
Before contracting to build a fence for someone, ensure you are clear about the requirements and obligations owed. Being clear on these from the outset will help avoid potential non-compliance down the track.
If you are ever unsure about your obligations and legal requirements when contracting to build someone a fence, or worried that you may have failed to comply with the requirements, get legal advice from a professional. This could save time and costs later.

Health and safety and employment go hand in hand. Part 2 of this series of articles looked at when WorkSafe New Zealand should intervene when an allegation of workplace bullying is raised. This final part explores the intersection between employment law and regulatory defence when health and safety concerns — or even WorkSafe intervention — arise out of a bullying allegation
W here the issue is limited to an employee raising a complaint internally, the employer is obliged to address the issue and take appropriate action (which we have set out in more detail below).
In our view, where there is a joint process of an employment complaint and a WorkSafe investigation, the method in which the employer addresses the complaint would likely not change. Nonetheless, the intersection between employment law and the regulatory framework can be challenging. A particular tension arises in the context of s168 of the HSWA, primarily in relation to WorkSafe exercising its powers to require a PCBU to produce information 1 and to present at a duty holder interview. 2 T he reality is that the information required, and questions put to the employer, will often extend beyond addressing the complaint made by the complainant.
An exploration of wider practices, policies and history of similar issues within the business will typically occur. In these circumstances, the employer may lose a significant amount of control over information, and this can give rise to risk in both the employment and regulatory contexts, whereas in employment only processes, that control largely sits with the employer.
Addressing a complaint
T he nature of the complaint will often inform the level of formality required in the employer’s response to it.
On one end, a complaint that involves relatively low-level alleged conduct (such as one-off instances of swearing or raised voices) may warrant a discussion, meeting, facilitation or other informal resolution.
On the other end, a more serious or complex complaint (harassment or continued bullying) or involving multiple complainants or respondents will usually warrant a formal investigation, carried out internally or externally.
An entire article could be written on the various steps necessary for a full and fair formal investigation, but in summary an employer ought to:
Clearly frame the allegations and terms of investigation from the outset.
Engage with the complainant and respondent regarding the approach to the investigation, proposed witnesses and proposed investigator.
Obtain consent from the complainant to provide details of the complaint to the respondent and other parties (otherwise risking a claim under the Privacy Act 2020).
Ensure the complainant and respondent are advised of their right to support and representation.
Ensure any external investigator is either a registered lawyer or is licensed in accordance with the Private Security Personnel and Private Investigators Act 2010. Investigate the complaint with a focus on impartiality and evidential scrutiny.
Obtain feedback from the complainant and respondent on any resulting investigation report prior to it being finalised. Where a WorkSafe investigation is ongoing or reasonably anticipated, employers should treat all statements, correspondence and investigation reports as discoverable by WorkSafe.
Managing concurrent personal grievance and a worksafe investigation
Seldom does an employer manage a complaint of bullying (whether informally or formally) without a personal grievance being raised by either the complainant or respondent.
Furthermore, situations can and do arise where a complainant is dissatisfied with their employer’s response to their complaint and so turns to WorkSafe as a means of escalating it.
Therefore, having heard from WorkSafe about its approach to psychosocial hazards in the section above, it is essential to consider the possibility of a personal grievance being lodged in the employment jurisdiction concurrently with an ongoing WorkSafe investigation.
In respect of relevant timeframes:
WorkSafe will have one year from the date of receipt of the complaint to determine whether it will prosecute. 3
The employee has 90 days, from the date the issue arose, to raise a personal grievance and three years from the date of raising the personal grievance to file a statement of problem in the Employment Relations Authority (Authority). 4
Typically, cases will be set down in the Authority within one year of filing of a statement of problem.
Where concurrent processes do occur, the difficulty rests in the magnitude of “worst case scenarios” in each process. Employment claims may garner awards of $20,000 to $30,000 as compensation, three months’ lost wages (where a resignation or dismissal has occurred) and modest tariff costs.
In contrast, prosecutions under the HSWA can — depending on the charges filed — attract conviction, potentially have a maximum fine of $500,000, 5 $1,500,000 6 or $3,000,000 7 , lay charges against officers, 8 make orders for reparation (this will vary depending on the degree of harm suffered) and incur prosecutor costs. If there were Authority proceedings on foot concurrent with a WorkSafe investigation, it would likely be appropriate to seek adjournment of the Authority’s proceedings until the WorkSafe process had concluded.
The realistic risk of prosecution
No prosecutions have been brought in respect of issues relating to bullying, harassment and intimidation in New Zealand by WorkSafe. Indeed, WorkSafe has taken a more holistic approach in addressing concerns raised regarding mentally healthy work, as described in the section above.
Notwithstanding this, our own experience tells us that WorkSafe has investigated allegations of bullying by an individual and reached a duty holder interview stage. At the same time, a personal grievance claim was timetabled for a hearing in the Authority.
Again, based on our own experience, we know that in matters where WorkSafe has proceeded with an investigation, its examination has been thorough and wide-reaching, covering years of records requiring substantial allocation of client resources to attend to requirements to produce information.
For example, an employer or PCBU will be required to produce years’ worth of any bullying complaints received, in addition to evidence/documentation of how the PCBU triaged and addressed those complaints.
While the type of information requested is not at odds with an employer’s relevant obligations in employment law, the concern relates to how extensive and far-reaching these requests can be.
An employment process is focused on particular individuals. In contrast, WorkSafe is looking for a PCBU to demonstrate it has robust and effective bullying policies and procedures in place, that workers are aware of how to raise complaints appropriately, and that the PCBU can demonstrate it follows its own policies.
WorkSafe can, and has, taken enforcement action short of prosecution in these investigations, such as the issuing of improvement notices under s101 of the HSWA. While a prosecution based on psychosocial risk or harm has not yet eventualised in New Zealand, it is certainly feasible.
In South Australia, which operates under a similar legislative framework, 9 a prosecution has successfully been brought regarding the bullying of a young apprentice. 10 The particular conduct in that case was egregious, namely by squirting and lighting flammable liquid onto the victim’s clothing. There is no reason why WorkSafe would not bring a prosecution for similar conduct.
Conclusion
We consider a New Zealand prosecution for psychosocial risk or harm related to bullying is a matter of when, not if. As with any litigation risk, the best way to mitigate liability is early intervention and prevention.
Balancing a PCBU/employer’s obligations, and applied specifically to this issue, employers should consider:
Developing tailored policies that denounce bullying, intimidation, harassment and other offensive behaviour, as well as prescribing procedure for complaints to be raised and dealt with.
Training employees and management on working in a manner consistent with such policies, including refresher training throughout employment.
Establishing lines of communication for employees to report any related issues. Ensuring that each complaint received is considered and addressed with appropriate weight.
Ensuring the triaging of complaints is compliant with employment law principles.
Where a complaint is upheld against an employee, ensuring that appropriate corrective or disciplinary action occurs.

Specify who the parties to the contract are. Are you contracting as yourself, or your company ?
Who is your client ? Are you contracting with a company, a trust or the owners personally ?
Make sure you include a date of contract. This can be important later on.
You should identify the address wherethe work will be done. This is particularly important if you are working on more than one site owned by that client.
It is important to specify the type of contract. For example, it could be:
A full contract, where you are responsible for all labour materials and site supervision, including supervision of your or your client’s subcontractors.
A labour-only contract.
A managed labour contract, where the client purchases materials and you carry out and supervise work, including supervision of your or the client’s subcontractors.
You need to be as clear as possible about the exact scope of the work to be done under the contract. This is particularly important, if you are not in control of the entire project.
If you are only responsible for part of the work, it is important to specify who is responsible for checking the interface between your work and the work of previous or subsequent contractors.
Consider whether you need to incorporate other documents into your written contract, such as your tender/estimate/quote, drawings and specifications, building consent conditions or other documents.
You should outline the process for how any variations to the written contract will be handled. This may mean including a requirement that variations be ordered and priced in writing and signed off by both parties.
When describing the time frame in which the work will be completed, you should include (as far as possible):
When you will start the work.
The estimated end date.
What happens if you’re late in completing the work.
What happens if others delay you.
Having appropriate insurance cover is a requirement that must be addressed before the project begins. The contract should state who is responsible for insuring the contract works and who is to be named as ‘insured’ under the Contract Works Policy.
Being clear about how the contract price is calculated is crucial. Clients hate surprises when it comes to costs!
It is also important to state when and how often payment claims can be issued. If this is not stated in writing, the fall-back position (under the Construction Contracts Act 2002) is that payment claims will be issued monthly.
A reminder about payment claims:
If you wish to take advantage of the enforcement provisions in the Construction Contracts Act 2002, your payment claims must be served on the payer and must:
Be in writing.
Contain details to identify the written construction contract to which the payment relates.
Identify the construction work and the period to which the payment relates.
Describe the claimed amount and due date for payment.
Describe how you calculated the claimed amount.
State that the payment claim is made under the Construction Contracts Act 2002.
If a payment claim is made on a residential client, it must be accompanied by a written notice describing the process for responding to the payment claim, and explain the consequences of not responding if full payment is not made by the due date. There is an online form you can use for this.
It is also important to state when payments are due. If this is not stated in writing, the fall-back position (under the Construction Contracts Act 2002) is that payments are due 20 working days after the payment claim was served. The payment section should also include whether interest is payable on late payments.
Your contract should include a defects repair period, during which you are responsible for repairing or rectifying defects that appear in the contract works.
This usually begins upon practical completion of the works and runs for a specified time frame (one, two or three months are common periods for small to medium projects).
It is important to set out an agreed method for resolving disputes, should they arise. Negotiation and mediation are commonly used dispute resolution processes. Arbitration is also commonly included in construction contracts, but this can be a very expensive and time-consuming process.
It is also very helpful to include a clause that says, even if there is a dispute, the payer cannot withhold payment from you.

The Supreme Court recently issued a decision that is relevant to any business facing hard trading conditions
The Supreme Court has issued a new decision, Madsen-Ries and Levin as Liquidators of Debut Homes Limited (in liquidation) v Cooper , which reviews the law relating to breaches of directors’ duties. The decision provides important guidance for company directors when facing hard trading conditions.
The Supreme Court found that companies in insolvency or near-insolvency situations must use the various formal mechanisms provided in the Companies Act 1993 (the Act), rather than trying to trade through. A copy of the decision is available here: courtsofnz.govt.nz/assets/cases/SC-29-2019-Debut-Homes-v-Cooper.pdf
Background The defendant, Mr Cooper, was the sole director of Debut Homes Ltd, a residential building company. At the end of 2012, one of Debut Homes’ financiers decided to cease funding them. Based on advice from the company’s accountant, Mr Cooper decided to wind down operations, while completing existing developments but not taking on any new projects. It was expected that once the company wound down, there would be approximately $300,000 owing in GST to IRD.
The decision to wind down operations, rather than cease trading immediately, was to the benefit of the homeowners of the completed residential properties and unsecured trade creditors, who supplied materials and labour, but was to IRD’s detriment as the company neglected to pay GST on the sale of the properties.
The High Court and Court of Appeal The High Court decided that Mr Cooper had breached his duties as a director, and ordered him to pay $280,000 to the liquidators of Debut Homes, to cover some of the shortfall to creditors.
The Court of Appeal overturned the High Court’s decision, determining that the decision to complete the houses was a “perfectly sensible business decision”.
The Supreme Court The Supreme Court overruled the Court of Appeal and restored the decision of the High Court, including ordering Mr Cooper to pay $280,000.
In coming to its decision, the Supreme Court reviewed each director duty contained in the Act:
Section 135 – reckless trading Under this section, a director must not agree to the business of the company being carried on, or cause or allow the business of the company to be carried on, in a manner likely to create a substantial risk of serious loss to creditors.
The Supreme Court decided: “If a company reaches the point where continued trading will result in a shortfall to creditors and the company is not salvageable, then continued trading will be in breach of s135 of the Act… this applies whether or not continued trading is projected to result in higher returns to some of the creditors than would be the case if the company had been immediately placed into liquidation, and whether or not any overall deficit was projected to be reduced.”
Section 136 – duty to not incur obligations Under this section, a director must not agree to the company incurring an obligation unless the director reasonably believes that the company will be able to perform the obligation as and when required. The focus of this section is on a particular obligation, rather than the business as a whole.
The Supreme Court’s view on section 136 is: “It is not legitimate to enter into a course of action to ensure some creditors have a higher return, where this is at the expense of incurring new liabilities which will not be paid. In other words, it is not legitimate to ‘rob Peter to pay Paul’.”
Section 131 – duty to act in good faith and in best interests of the company This section requires a director to act in good faith and in the best interests of the company.
The Supreme Court confirmed that this is a subjective test and that the courts are not well-equipped to second-guess business decisions made by directors.  However, the Court also noted that there are a number of exceptions to the subjective test, including where:
There is no evidence of actual consideration by the director of the best interests of the company.
In an insolvency or near-insolvency situation, there is a failure to consider the interests of creditors.
There is a conflict of interest, or the action was one no director with any understanding of fiduciary duties could have taken.
A director’s decisions are irrational.
In this case, Mr Cooper had failed to consider the interests of all creditors in an insolvency situation. Instead, he considered some creditors, but discounted the interests of others.
What should the director have done? The Act has a number of mechanisms available for dealing with insolvency and near-insolvency situations:
A creditor’s compromise, which usually involves all or part of a company’s debts being cancelled and must be approved by a majority of creditors.
A court-approved creditor’s compromise, where the court must also agree that the compromise is fair and reasonable to all creditors.
Voluntary administration, which provides for the appointment of an administrator to maximise the chances of the company’s survival, and which also must be approved by a majority of creditors.
Liquidation, to wind up the operation of the company.
A feature of all of these mechanisms is that the decision-making is placed in the hands of either the creditors or an independent party. The Supreme Court noted that:
“The removal of decision-making powers from directors in such circumstances is a recognition that directors are not the appropriate decision-makers in times of insolvency or near-insolvency.  This is because their decisions may be compromised by conflicting interests and, even where that is not the case, they may be too close to the company and its business to be able to take a realistic and impartial view of the company’s situation.”
If a company is or may be insolvent, a director must consider the views of all of its creditors. Quite when and how this is done remains a difficult balancing act.
If you are a director of a company which is in an insolvency or near-insolvency situation, it is critical for you to take steps to deal with the situation as quickly as possible, otherwise you face potentially significant personal liability.

TITLE   : BUILDING ACT CHANGES OVERVIEW

On 8 May 2020, the Minister for Building and Construction introduced the Building (Building Products and Methods, Modular Components, and Other Matters) Amendment Bill to the House. This Bill contains the most comprehensive changes to the Building Act 2004 for some time and will affect all within the industry
The changes in this Bill form part of a wider programme of work to lift performance of the regulatory system and drive better outcomes for the sector and for New Zealanders.
Public input on the proposed reforms was sought last year and, in November 2019, the Government announced the first changes it intended to implement.
The aim of this Bill is to make changes that will allow the sector to shift to new, more effective ways of working, help support productivity improvements, lift the efficiency and quality of building work and improve trust and confidence in the building regulatory system.
In particular the Bill has a focus on modern construction methods, such as off-site manufacturing and prefabrication. These methods have the potential to deliver innovative and less expensive buildings. The current consenting process is based on traditional construction methods, which can cause delays and are seen as a barrier to these methods. Steps to address these barriers will be welcome news to those wishing to make use of and develop these methods.
Listed below are the key changes included in the Bill.
MINIMUM INFORMATION
Manufacturers and suppliers will be required to make a minimum level of information publicly available regarding the building products that they sell. There will be duties on manufacturers and suppliers to ensure product information is not false or misleading and provide evidence to substantiate product claims. These changes should result in there being fewer delays during the consenting process which will reduce time and cost for building owners.
The information that will be required will be the subject of later regulations. It is anticipated to include:
A description of the product.
Details of the supplier.
Information on the scope and limitations of use of the product.
Design, installation and maintenance requirements.
A declaration as to whether the product is subject to a warning or a ban.
MANUFACTURER CERTIFICATION
The Bill introduces a new voluntary manufacturer certification scheme for manufacturers of off-site prefabricated and modular buildings. The certification process will involve an assessment of the whole process, from design and manufacture, through to transportation and delivery to site.
The scheme will provide a shorter and more efficient consenting process for certified manufacturers, which should save time and money without compromising quality. This could lead to wider use of off-site products in the building industry.
PENALTIES
New offences and penalties have been created in relation to breaches of the minimum information requirements and certification of off-site products. Penalties have also been increased for existing offences under the Act. The period to file charges has also been extended from six to twelve months. These changes aim to provide greater protection for building users and deter sub-standard work and poor practices within the industry.
CODEMARK
The CodeMark scheme will be strengthened to prevent the registration of unsuitable products by certification bodies and provide greater product assurance. The amendments seek to give MBIE greater oversight of the scheme, the right to set compliance rules and the ability to suspend or revoke a body’s ability to certify products if they do not comply with these rules.
There will also be a registration requirement for certification bodies. These changes will provide greater confidence in the CodeMark scheme for both building owners and consenting authorities.
BUILDING LEVY
An increase to the scope of the Building Levy, which will enable MBIE to spend levy funds on activities relating to the broader oversight of the industry.
WHAT HAPPENS FROM HERE?
The Bill will now have its first reading in Parliament before the Select Committee process begins. You can follow the Bill’s progression on the Parliamentary website.
Submissions are invited on the proposed amendments. Details of how to make a submission will be available soon, so make sure to keep an eye on building.govt.nz .
If you have questions or would like assistance to make a submission on the Bill, please contact Alysha Hinton on (04) 4719452 or at alysha.hinton@duncancotterill.com , or your local Duncan Cotterill advisor ( duncancotterill.com ).

The Government has announced substantial changes to the Companies Act 1993 (Companies Act), which are designed to support businesses struggling as a result of the impact of COVID-19 and the Level 4 Government-imposed lockdown
The aim of these changes is to preserve business and to help companies avoid insolvency during this turbulent period and for a six-month period thereafter, thereby reducing the long-term impact on our economy. The emphasis is very much on providing a comprehensive framework to assist companies that are acting reasonably and prudently, but are otherwise encountering difficulties as a direct result of COVID-19.
What temporary changes have been announced to prevent insolvency?
The Government has announced two key legislative changes to the Companies Act designed to prevent solvent businesses facing temporary financial distress from being prematurely placed into liquidation.
The two key insolvency regimes announced by the Government include the:
‘Business Debt Hibernation’ ( BDH ) regime, which provides businesses with an option to place existing debts on hold until they can start trading normally again, subject to creditor agreement;
‘Safe Harbour’ regime, which provides directors with security against a legal claim for failing to meet their insolvency duties under the Companies Act as a direct result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
These changes are intended to assist by providing directors with the assurance needed to continue to trade, despite the risks of insolvency due to decreased cashflow. Similar regimes have already been implemented to help preserve solvent businesses in Australia and the United Kingdom.
Both regimes are subject to legislation being passed in Parliament over the coming weeks, and once passed will apply retrospectively from 3 April 2020.
Business Debt Hibernation
The BDH regime provides a simple and flexible method for businesses to negotiate an arrangement with their creditors to place the payment of existing debts on hold until they can resume trading as usual. This is similar to the Creditors Compromise scheme under Part 14 of the Companies Act, which allows a company to implement an arrangement with some or all of its creditors.
The process of the BDH regime is expected to operate as follows:
The affected business notifies its creditors that it intends to put forward a BDH proposal, subject to meeting the threshold required (the details of which have yet to be announced).
The creditors have a month to vote on the proposal from the date of notification. The creditors are prevented from taking legal action against the company to recover their debt during this month.
If 50% of the company’s creditors (calculated by number and value) agree to the company’s existing debt being “hibernated” under the proposal, it becomes binding on all creditors. In this instance:
The creditors are prevented from taking legal action against the company to recover their debt for a period of six months.
The business in BDH continues to trade and to pay new third-party creditors. The payments made to third-party creditors will not be subject to the voidable transactions regime if they meet certain requirements.
If the proposal is rejected by the creditors, the directors have the option of either continuing to trade, entering into a voluntary administration, or appointing a liquidator.
The BDH regime is designed to open the lines of communication between debtor and creditors and enable directors to retain control of the company, rather than passing control to an insolvency practitioner upon liquidation. It will also provide certainty to new creditors that they won’t have to repay any money they receive if the business is subsequently placed into liquidation. This in turn will encourage businesses to continue transacting with companies who are in BDH by limiting their risks in doing so.
The scope and application of the proposed BDH regime at this early stage is unclear, including how it will operate practically, how quickly it will come into force, and whether creditors will engage with the scheme to enable it to succeed. If COVID-19 restrictions extend beyond four weeks, creditors may be unable to agree to existing debt being “hibernated” due to the flow on effect this will have on their own cashflow.
Other significant issues that have yet to be clarified within the BDH regime include:
Whether the “existing debt” to which the BDH applies must have arisen as a result of COVID-19, or if it can relate to prior debt.
If a debtor can reasonably “prioritise” some creditors over others, with those others having their debts deferred for six months.
Whether commercial rent can be deferred under the scheme, and the effect this has on the cancellation provisions in a Deed of Lease.
We will continue to monitor these issues and provide updates when further details on the regime are made available.
Safe Harbour regime
The impact of COVID-19 creates an unprecedented amount of challenges for company directors. A key issue is how to trade through this period of significant uncertainty without breaching their duties under the Companies Act, including the duty not to trade while insolvent. There are serious consequences for breaching these duties, including potential personal liability for reckless trading (section 135) or incurring an obligation the directors did not believe the company would be able to meet (section 136).
The Safe Harbour regime will temporarily protect directors from personal liability under section 135 and 136 of the Companies Act for a period of six months, effective from 3 April 2020. It is designed to assist directors, who are managing companies facing significant liquidity issues by limiting their risk and easing their concerns in doing so. This is intended to encourage directors to continue to trade and incur obligations, as opposed to prematurely winding up the company due to the risk of personal liability.
For the Safe Harbour regime to apply to directors’ decisions, three key requirements must be met:
In the good faith opinion of the directors, the company is facing or is likely to face significant liquidity problems in the next six months due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on them or their creditors;
The company was able to pay its debts as they fell due on 31 December 2019; and
The directors consider, in good faith, that it is more likely than not that the company will be able to pay its debts as they fall due within 18 months.
It is important to note that the regime does not relieve directors from their duty to act in good faith and in the best interests of its creditors, nor does it protect directors of businesses that were not solvent prior to COVID-19. While the scheme provides directors with an opportunity to trade through this period of uncertainty, they are still required to ensure that they are taking legitimate business risks relative to the current economic climate . If there is no prospect of recovery, directors will still be required to assess whether entering into voluntary liquidation or administration may be necessary to protect creditors.

TITLE   : PROTECT YOUR TOOLS!

Law firm Duncan Cotterill provides tips on how to protect the tools of your trade as a subcontractor
Most players in the construction industry will be faced with an insolvent counterparty sooner or later. If you work as a subcontractor, you face unique risks if the head contractor goes into liquidation or receivership.
Here we look at how subcontractors can protect their tools and equipment from being seized when the head contractor goes bust.
Liquidation vs. receivership
Though the outcome is often the same, there are a few important differences between a company going into liquidation or receivership.
Receivership: A receiver is nominated by a secured creditor (eg, a bank) and acts for the benefit of that creditor alone. A receiver decides the best way to recover the debt – they may decide to keep the company trading or may simply take possession and sell the secured assets. After this process, the company resumes possession of the remaining assets and theoretically could continue trading, but will most commonly go into liquidation.
Liquidation: A liquidator is appointed to take possession of all the assets of the company and distribute these to the creditors in order of priority. All creditors may record their debt against the company during a meeting of the creditors. Liquidators have the power to investigate the company and hold the directors personally accountable if they have breached their duties.
Risks
Liquidators and receivers have the duty of identifying the assets of the head contractor. In order to do this, it is common for the head contractor’s sites to be locked and access restricted. If your property is on site, it may be some time before it is identified, distinguished from the head contractor’s or other third party’s property, and returned to you. This may disrupt your work schedule, delay contracts with other clients, or prevent you from  working altogether. You might even lose title to your property and it could be sold as an asset of the head contractor.
Compensation
Theoretically, you should be able to claim against the head contractor for any loss of profit while you are denied access to your tools or equipment. However, a head contractor in liquidation rarely has enough assets to even cover their secured creditors.
Access to site
Once a liquidator or receiver is appointed, the control of the site passes to them.
If you find yourself locked out of a site because a head contractor has gone under, contact the liquidator or receiver directly. Do not force entry onto the site. Accessing the site without the approval of a liquidator or receiver  could result in a trespass notice being issued and police involvement. The penalty for trespass offences is a fine of up to $1,000 or a prison term of up to three months.
Proactive steps
It is difficult to operate totally risk-free, but there are certain steps that you can take in advance to mitigate the risks:
1. Take your goods home
The most straightforward method of protecting your property is to remove it from the site at the end of each day.
2. Clearly label and identify
If it is impractical or impossible to take your property home each day (as is the case with scaffolding, cranes, etc.), ensure your property is clearly labelled, identifiable and stored separately, and that you have good records  demonstrating ownership. Beware of storage facilities that are small and cluttered, as your property is more at risk of becoming intermingled or indistinguishable from other parties’ property.
3. Have a written contract
A written contract with the head contractor can include specific terms to protect your property. Your contract should:
Identify your property and confirm you alone own it, including any materials you supply until paid in full.
Include the right to enter a locked site and re-take possession of your distinguished property.
Authorise you to register a security interest over your property – see our comments below.
Given the importance of a contract, we recommend before signing you have the contract reviewed by your advisor to ensure it is appropriate to your particular circumstances.
4. Register a personal property security interest
The Personal Property Securities Act 1999 (PPSA) governs interests in personal property (eg, materials, equipment, vehicles). If your contract with the head contractor is for an indefinite period or for more than one year, or  contains a retention of title arrangement, you can register a security interest on the Personal Property Securities Register (or the PPSR).
Failing to register your security interest can mean that you lose priority against other claimants, or even that your interest is extinguished, so it is best to register your security interest as soon as you have entered into the  contract.
5. Be alert
It is difficult to predict when a company is in financial difficulties. Insist on regular billing, follow up on unpaid invoices promptly, and stay alert to market rumours.
While these steps will provide subcontractors with some protection, they will not eliminate the risks completely when a head contractor goes under. Subcontractors need to carefully plan for how they limit this exposure to their  business.

What options are available to you if all lines of communication have broken down and your dispute remains unresolved?
In our previous article, we discussed the most prudent first steps to recovering costs when hit with delays, disruptions and variations. While coming to an agreement between the parties is significantly cheaper and faster for everyone involved; if this has proved difficult, what are your options?
A.Communicate your dispute clearly and formally, with evidence
If you are not making any progress resolving your dispute directly through emails or phone calls, it is now time to send a formal letter.
This may help to instil a sense of urgency or legitimacy to your dispute, and it is a helpful paper trail to establish. Address the letter to the other party or parties’ registered office(s), and be sure to include:
the nature and grounds of the dispute.
any documentation or evidence supporting this dispute, including correspondence between the parties.
your expectations of the other party, and the date you expect these to be fulfilled.
the action you intend to take if these expectations are not met.
any of your own obligations and the date you anticipate these to be fulfilled.
a request for acknowledgement of the letter.
You may wish to instruct a lawyer to send this letter on your behalf to further legitimise the dispute and give weight to any further actions you intend to take if the dispute is not resolved.
B.Instigate an adjudication
The Construction Contracts Act 2002 provides simple and speedy dispute resolution procedures specifically for construction payment claims and building defects. If your contract includes an adjudication clause, this should be your first avenue to find a resolution. Carefully read your contract and the Construction Contracts Act, to ensure you comply with the necessary timeframes and any procedural steps that need to be satisfied.
In brief, adjudication is initiated by the claimant serving a notice of adjudication on the other party to the construction contract. An adjudicator is then appointed, either by agreement or by a nominating body agreed by the parties.
The claimant must then serve an adjudication claim, specifying the nature and grounds of the dispute, and provide any supporting evidence. This must set out all the disputes between the parties, as additional disputes cannot be added at a later stage. The respondent then has five working days to respond to the adjudication claim.
The adjudicator may decide to take a number of steps, including requesting further documents, appointing an expert advisor, inspecting anything relevant to the dispute and/or calling a conference of the parties. The adjudicator will then release a determination.
As a general position, parties will share equally in the adjudicator’s fees and expenses.
You may pursue an adjudication parallel with court proceedings or other dispute resolution process. An adjudication determination is binding and enforceable, but not final. If you are unhappy with the determination, you have the option of appealing it.
As indicated above, however, be sure to first review the dispute resolution procedures in any relevant construction contract you have in place to ensure you comply with timeframes and any agreed steps to escalate a dispute.
C.Escalate
To appeal an adjudication determination, or further escalate the dispute, you may choose to pursue mediation, arbitration, or proceedings such as in the Disputes Tribunal or the District Court.
Each of these options has its own merits and limitations and you should talk to a lawyer to consider which avenue is best for your circumstances. A lawyer will be well placed to conduct a cost-benefit analysis with you, considering the merits of your claims, the ability of the other party to pay, any legal or other costs involved, likely timeframes, and the amount you may realistically recover through each mechanism.
D.Issue (or defend) a statutory demand
Further, if the dispute involves a debt to be paid to you, there may also be grounds to issue a statutory demand under section 289 of the Companies Act 1993.
A statutory demand may only be issued if the debt is not in dispute, or else it may be considered an abuse of process. However, to be “in dispute” requires more than an assertion; the debtor must have some evidence or grounds for the dispute.
If you wish to issue a statutory demand, ensure you include the necessary details and correctly serve it on the debtor. Be mindful, though, a statutory demand can be an effective way to get a debtor to prioritise a debt, but it may also inflame the dispute or sour your relationship with that party – this can have particularly negative consequences if your relationship is ongoing.
If you have received a statutory demand, pay close attention to the time frames. You have ten working days if you wish to challenge the demand or apply to set it aside, or 15 working days to pay the debt. If you miss these deadlines, the creditor can seek an order to place your company into liquidation.
A lawyer will be able to assist with issuing or defending a statutory demand correctly.

O ver the past several months, these legal features have discussed certain areas of the Construction Contracts Act 2002 (Act) , including why the Act provides a useful aid to getting paid and when payments are due under the Act. In this article, we focus on the dispute method favoured by the Act if it all goes wrong.
Generally speaking, if a dispute arises under a contract, there are a number of ways it can be sorted without resorting to the courts. Typical options include arbitration, mediation, expert determination, early neutral evaluation or adjudication.
For the purposes of this article, we have focused on adjudication. This is a legal process in which an adjudicator reviews evidence (including relevant documents and written statements) and written legal arguments, as set forth by opposing parties. It is the method favoured by the Act, on the basis that it is intended to provide a fast and cost-effective process capable of maintaining cash flow while the dispute is resolved.
Adjudication is the method favoured by the Act, on the basis that it is intended to provide a fast and cost-effective dispute resolution process
Although adjudication may be daunting to the uninitiated, the key steps under the Act are relatively straightforward and easily understood.
The key steps in an adjudication process under the Act are:
1. The claimant will serve notice on the other party (respondent).
2. Within five working days of serving the notice, the claimant should request an agreed adjudicator. If an adjudicator cannot be agreed upon, then a nominating body (as may be set out in the contract between the parties) will select an adjudicator. If a nominating body is not set out in the contract then an Authorised Nominating Authority (ANA) can be requested to select an adjudicator.
3. Once selected, the adjudicator must indicate their ability within two working days of the request that they are willing to act. The adjudicator’s acceptance must be confirmed to the claimant and the respondent.
4. The claimant then has five working days after the adjudicator’s notice of acceptance to put their dispute in writing, specifying what the dispute is over.
5. Within five working days of the claimant putting the dispute in writing, the respondent must submit a written response. If they do not file a response, the adjudication will continue anyway. The respondent may request an extension of time to file their response.
6. The adjudicator will then investigate the matter and may request further details from the parties and/or call a conference if required. The parties must cooperate with this process.
7. After the investigation is finished, the adjudicator will issue a written determination, outlining their reasons, normally within 20 days after the respondent’s response was due; that can be extended to 30 days if the parties agree.
(These steps are described in sections 28 to 49 of the Construction Contracts Act 2002) .
If your construction contract does not contain clauses relating to appointing an adjudicator, an Authorised Nominating Authority (ANA) can be used to select one for you.
In New Zealand, these include:
• Adjudicator Association of New Zealand (AANZ) ( www.adjudicators.co.nz ).
• Arbitrates and Mediator’s Institute of New Zealand (AMINZ) ( www.aminz.org.nz ).
• Building Disputes Tribunal New Zealand (BDT) ( www.buildingdisputestribunal.co.nz ).
• Construction Dispute Service ( www.constructiondisputeserices.co.nz ).
The New Zealand Institute of Quantity Surveyors Inc. has also applied to become an ANA and currently has an established list of adjudicators.
It is noted that the BDT should not be confused with New Zealand tribunals such as the Maori Land, Tenancy or ACC tribunals. The latter are tribunals created and operated by central government in a similar manner to a court. The BDT and other ANAs are non-government organisations that have been authorised under section 65 of the Construction Contracts Act 2002 .
Costs vary between the different ANAs but generally include:
• An application fee (for AMINZ this is $500, while BDT has no application fee).
• Payment of the adjudicator’s fees and expenses, which are generally shared in equal proportions between the parties under section 57 of the Construction Contracts Act 2002 (unless the claim was without merit or a party acted in an improper manner). However, some ANAs may require that the applicant pay the full estimated fee as a security fee prior to the adjudicator’s notice of acceptance.
Parties pay their own costs and expenses under the Act, unless a party acts in ‘bad faith’ or maintains allegations without substantial merit.
The total cost will depend on the adjudicator and the complexity of the matter. However, adjudication is generally a more cost-effective method of dispute resolution than resorting to the courts.
Adjudicator determinations are interim decisions and the dispute can still be pursued through the court or arbitration. However, anecdotal evidence suggests that adjudication is often the final step in many disputes.
Another key advantage of adjudication is that, unlike a court decision, an adjudication can remain confidential between the parties.

With building supply shortages threatening the timeframe requirements of many contracts, it is important to understand what your contractual options are if timeframes cannot be met. Legal firm Duncan Cotterill explains how the causes of these delays relate to your contracts and your options
COVID-19 restrictions are continuing to have an impact on the construction industry. There are numerous reports of construction projects being delayed due to a shortage of building supplies. There was always likely to be an impact on specialist products from overseas, but there are shortages of even basic materials, particularly plumbing, electrical and glass supplies. The shortage of basic supplies clearly has a wide-reaching impact across the industry.
The usual remedy of seeking to source alternative products will become more and more difficult as these will also become scarce and, of course, there is a time and cost implication of doing this. It is also necessary to get the approval of the consenting authority for a change of materials to ensure compliance with building consents and the building code, which causes further cost and delay.
There are multiple reasons for the current shortages. One of the consequences of the national lockdown in 2020 was a reduction in orders and production by suppliers as many predicted that there would be a downturn in the construction industry. While many larger construction projects were put on hold or were delayed, there has actually been an increase in some sectors, particularly residential renovations and new builds. There have also been severe delays at the Ports of Auckland, with reports of some ships having to wait up to 12 days to unload which has impacted the overseas supply chain. Many of these basic supplies come from overseas, so importation delays have a significant impact.
In terms of overall project delivery, there may be limited ability for the head contractor to mitigate delays as it may not be possible to proceed with other aspects of the build until the impacted trade can finish its works. The highlighted impacted trades are often some of the first to be done on a project and the remainder of the works are contingent on these being completed.
It is likely that the risk of supplier delays will fall on the contractor and will lead to the contractor being exposed for the consequences of late project delivery, including liquidated damages.
Usually there is no specific right for a contractor to claim an extension of time under its construction contract for supply chain delays. In the absence of a specific provision covering this issue, a contractor is likely to be left with seeking to rely on the common extension of time ground of “ circumstances not reasonably foreseeable by an experienced contractor at the time of tendering and not due to the fault of the contractor” (10.3.1(f) NZS 3910:2013 ).
It then becomes necessary to analyse whether or not supply chain issues were reasonably foreseeable at the time of tendering. Arguably COVID-19 related issues have been reasonably foreseeable for some time as these were predicted and commented on as far back as when COVID-19 began to emerge, even prior to the 2020 national lockdown. The delays at Ports of Auckland have been reported on since November 2020, so have been reasonably foreseeable since that time. Depending on what the time of tendering is, it may therefore be very difficult for contractors to be able to successfully argue an extension of time claim under 10.3.1(f).
It is therefore vital for contractors to consider current and potential future supply delays when agreeing a programme for a project to try and mitigate the risk of late delivery. Since COVID-19 emerged there has been the inclusion in many contracts of provisions enabling the contractor to claim an extension of time and potentially cost in the event of delays due to COVID-19. These range from being specific to lockdown scenarios, to others which cover any effect, and therefore would cover supply chain issues that were related to COVID-19. Contractors should check current contracts to see whether they have COVID-19 clauses they can rely on. For future projects, contractors should consider the inclusion of tag to cover this risk.
Communication between the parties also remains key, as has been seen with all other COVID-19-related issues. Clear, constructive communication means resolution can be reached and the impact on the project is minimised for all involved.

TITLE   : Limitation of liability upheld

A recent High Court decision has important implications for limitation of liability clauses, as law firm Duncan Cotterill explains
Imagine being responsible for millions of dollars of damages but only being liable to pay a fraction of this because of a clause in your contract. This is how limitation of liability clauses work. A limitation of liability clause limits the amount of money or damages that one party can recover from another party for breaches or performance failures.
The High Court has recently handed down an important decision on limitation of liability clauses in Tauranga City Council v Harrison Grierson Holdings Ltd and Constructure Auckland Ltd [2024] NZHC 714 . In this decision, the Court dismissed the argument that the limitation of liability clauses were not enforceable and accepted that the limitation can apply to breaches of duty arising under the Building Act 2004 and section 9 of the Fair Trading Act. This means the defendants’ liability for a claim of around $27 million is capped at $2 million for Harrison Grierson and $500,000 for Constructure.
The upholding of limitation of liability clauses is a big decision for the construction and insurance sectors, as it provides greater certainty for allocating risk.
Background
Tauranga City Council (TCC) purchased land in Tauranga to build a car parking building. It entered into a contract with Harrison Grierson (HG) for the structural design of the building, using a Long Form Agreement issued by Engineering NZ (HG Contract). The HG Contract contained a standard limitation of liability clause, stating that the maximum amount payable shall be:
Five times the fee, with a minimum amount of $500,000 and maximum liability of $2,000,000 for professional liability, and $10,000,000 for public liability.’
Constructure was subsequently engaged to undertake a peer review of the structural design and entered into a Short Form Agreement in the ACENZ/IPENZ format (Constructure Contract). The Constructure Contract contained a similar limitation clause:
‘The maximum amount payable, whether in contract, tort, or otherwise, in relation to claims, damages, liabilities, losses or expenses, shall be five times the fee (exclusive of GST and disbursements) with a maximum limit of $500,000.’
Throughout the project, HG and Constructure also signed various producer statements in relation to the design and its peer review, which contained a standard producer statement limitation clause:
‘Note: This statement shall only be relied upon by the Building Consent Authority named above. Liability under this statement accrues to the Design Firm only. The total maximum amount of damages payable arising from the statement and all other statements provided to the Building Consent Authority in relation to this building work, whether in contract, tort or otherwise (including negligence), is limited to the sum of $200,000.’
An issue with the design was encountered during construction. The work required to correct the design issues was substantial and TCC abandoned the project. It sold the land for $1, due to the cost of demolishing the partly built structure, and claimed damages of around $27 million from HG and Constructure. TCC alleged breach of contract, negligence, breach of the Building Act, breach of the Fair Trading Act and negligent misstatement.
The application of the limitation of liability clauses was dealt with as a preliminary issue.
Building Act
TCC claimed that a duty arises from the statutory requirements of the Building Act 2004, which includes a requirement that building work comply with the Building Code. TCC argued that parties cannot contract out of Building Act and that limitation of liability clauses are therefore illegal under the Contract and Commercial Law Act (CCLA).
Justice Tahana examined the history of building law in New Zealand and found that:
Each defendant owes a duty to TCC to exercise reasonable care and skill to ensure the design (or review of the design) complies with the Building Code.
Design work is included within the definition of building work at sections 17 and 18 of the Building Act.
It is settled law that the Building Act gives rise to a common law duty by those who undertake building work to owners of commercial or non-residential buildings (in addition to residential owners) to exercise reasonable care and skill with a view to ensuring building work complies with the Building Code. This duty is owed under the statutory requirement in section 17 of the Building Act and applies to each defendant.
Limitation of liability clauses are not agreeing to a lesser standard of building work than the minimum standard set out in Building Act. Rather, they simply allocate risk and agree the sharing of financial consequences of a breach of the Building Act above the value of the liability cap. The clauses are therefore not in breach of section 17 of the Building Act.
Limitation clauses are not contrary to public policy.
Fair Trading Act
The Fair Trading Act (FTA) includes a general prohibition on contracting out, unless the parties are in trade and meet the requirements of the exception in section 5D. For this, the parties must have agreed to contract out and it must be fair and reasonable that the parties are bound by the clause.
The Court reiterated that the limitation of liability clauses seeks to limit liability with regard to the right of recovery, not as to required conduct. While a limitation of liability does not authorise the contravening conduct, it evidences an agreement that should the conduct occur, liability is to be limited to the value of the liability cap.
The Court reviewed other judgments that have considered this point, including last year’s decision in Tadd Management Ltd v Weine (as trustees of the Ruth Weine Family Trust) [2023] NZHC 764, and concluded that the limitation of liability clauses meet the requirements of section 5D for contracting out of the FTA. Any liability of each defendant for breach of section 9 of the FTA is therefore limited to the amount specified in each limitation of liability clause in the contracts.
Negligent misstatement
Justice Tahana found that the limitation of liability clauses also applies to the negligent misstatement claim. Each defendant’s issuing of a producer statement is governed by the contracts (and therefore the limitation clauses found within those contracts) as opposed to the terms of the producer statement. The Court rejected the argument that a producer statement constituted a separate contract between the TCC and each defendant, or that the producer statement cannot be relied on unless the limitation clause contained therein also applies.
The Court noted that the limitation of liability clause in the producer statement is directed to TCC as the building consent authority and not to TCC as the building owner. This means that the contracts govern the relationship between building owner and the defendants, and the limitation of liability clause in each producer statement cannot override the limitation of liability clause in the contracts.
What this means for the construction industry
This case and the Tadd Management case are great results for those in the construction industry, as it provides much greater certainty about liability. It has also highlighted the necessity of ensuring all potential claims are covered by limitation clauses, for every piece of work or advice rendered.

The Pike River Mine tragedy, in which 29 men lost their lives, was one of New Zealand’s worst workplace accidents. What followed was a Royal Commission and the creation of an Independent Taskforce into Workplace Health and Safety.
The Royal Commission’s report concluded that the board of directors of Pike River Coal completely failed in their governance role and was critical of Pike River’s “culture of production”. The Royal Commission’s report also firmly fixed the spotlight on the statutory responsibilities of directors for health and safety in the workplace, recommending that:
The statutory responsibilities of directors for health and safety in the workplace should be reviewed.
The health and safety regulator should issue an approved code of practice to guide directors on how good governance practices can be used to manage health and safety risks.
Directors should rigorously review and monitor their organisation’s compliance with health and safety.
The Health and Safety in Employment Act 1992 (HSEA) is aimed at preventing people from being harmed at work. It applies to everyone and all places of work, regardless of whether the person is an employer, employee, contractor or a visitor.
The HSEA puts the responsibility first and foremost on employers (directors can only be prosecuted under the HSEA if the director has authorised, assented to, acquiesced in or participated in a breach of the HSEA by the employer) to take all practical steps to identify and manage workplace hazards. The HSEA requires employers to take all practical steps to:
Provide and maintain a safe working environment.
Ensure that all plant, equipment and tools are safe to use.
Ensure that employees are not exposed to any hazards in or near their place of work.
Have procedures for dealing with emergencies.
The HSEA also requires employers to identify all hazards in their place of work and, where appropriate, to eliminate, isolate or minimise those hazards (in that descending order).
Employees are also responsible under the HSEA for taking all practical steps to ensure that they, or anyone else, are not harmed at work.
In the wake of the Pike River Tragedy, the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) and the Institute of Directors have recently issued a Good Governance Practice Guideline for managing health and safety risks.
The guideline is neither a policy statement nor a statutory document, but it emphasises that the directors of a company are best placed to ensure that the company effectively manages health and safety. It also stipulates that the focus of directors should be on determining an organisation’s purpose, developing an effective governance culture, holding management to account and ensuring effective compliance.
The guideline suggests that directors should focus on four key areas:
Policy and planning
Delivery
Monitoring
Reviewing
The guideline also emphasises that health and safety should be a part of everyday business and is as important as any other aspect of running a business.
A copy of the guideline can be downloaded for free by going to:
www.MBIE.govt.nz > News > In focus > Pike River > Media Releases > Guidelines for directors on their health and safety responsibilities
For many small companies, where the directors are actively involved in carrying out work and managing the health and safety issues arising from the day-to-day operation of the business, the guideline may be of limited application, as the directors will be intimately familiar with any health and safety issues.
However, as businesses grow and directors and senior managers become more removed from the day-to-day operation of the business, the guideline is a useful starting point and reminder for directors to review, consider and monitor their organisation’s compliance with the HSEA – both for the director’s own benefit and that of their business and its employees as well.

Ever been tempted to dash off a quick email response to a customer, agreeing to do something while you are off to the next job?
Emails and texts are increasingly used in businesses as a quick and easy means of communication. The problem with our dependence on emails and texts, however, is that often we do not apply the same level of thought to them before we push send as we might do with an official letter. Other times, despite our best efforts, the message may be unclear. Consequently, something you have written and sent within seconds could have lasting implications on your business.
This is what you need to know to avoid your next email getting you in a bind.
The law treats emails the same as it does any other form of communication. Section 8 of the Electronic Transactions Act 2002 makes it clear that even if a contract is concluded over the internet, rather than on paper or in person, it will still be valid and binding.
Technology has expanded the ways we can enter into contracts. Contracts can be formed by:
An exchange of emails.
An exchange of scanned hardcopy documents.
Online order forms.
Online auctions (eg on Trademe).
‘Clicking’ acceptance of terms displayed on a website.
Email or hardcopy mail acceptance of terms displayed on a website.
The conduct of a party in response to an offer on a website (ie if you act as if you have accepted that offer).
Oral communications (ie without being committed to writing in any form).
Contrary to what some people think, a contract does not necessarily have to be in writing or recorded in a signed formal document in order to be binding and enforceable. New Zealand courts have confirmed that a binding contract can be made through the exchange of emails. The courts will apply the same tests of contract formation to email correspondence as they would for other forms of communication.
For a contract to be binding under New Zealand law, the following key elements are required:
One party to the contract must make an offer.
That offer must be accepted by the other party.
Acceptance must be supported by consideration.
The terms of the contract must be certain.
There needs to be an intention by both parties to create a legal relationship.
If all of these elements can be ascertained from emails or texts, a binding contract is formed.
Certain contracts are required to be in writing and signed, such as contracts for the sale of land. Although the Electronic Transactions Act 2002 allows for contracts to be written and signed in electronic form, the typical email is unlikely to meet the specific requirements under that Act relating to signatures. These requirements include that an electronic signature must adequately identify who the signatory is and indicate his/her approval of the information to which the signature relates.
On the other hand, the recently introduced consumer protection measures requirements – which stipulate that building contractors must provide a written contract for residential building work costing $30,000 or more (including GST) – could be met by email, provided that the email covers the extensive content requirements under the Building Act regulations. This is because, for residential building contracts, the only ‘form’ requirement under that Act is that they be in writing. Under the Electronic Transactions Act 2002, the requirement for information to be in writing can be met by electronic means if it is readily accessible, so it can be used for subsequent reference (which emails typically are if you don’t delete them).
Email is a desirable means of communication because it is convenient and easily accessible. However, businesses and their personnel should always be aware of the potential implications and consequences of their email correspondence. A quick email or text fired off in response to a client’s question could be binding.
The best approach to prevent issues like this occurring is to implement an email policy for your business that lays out what types of correspondence should not be dealt with in emails. If there is any doubt about what is being discussed or agreed, it may be best to employ the old-fashioned method and pick up the phone or discuss issues face-to-face and then follow up with an email or a letter (or a written contract), which sets out exactly what has been agreed.

When it comes to the issue of workplace bullying, it is important to know when WorkSafe New Zealand should intervene in the matter and how that intersects with obligations under employment law. This series of articles looks at this question in more detail
I n 2021, the most recent year for which complete data is available, WorkSafe New Zealand received over 7,000 reports regarding health and safety concerns. 1
These can be broken down into several categories, the most general of which relates to fears about unsafe or potentially unsafe conditions and/or practices.
In 2021, there were 2,864 concerns received within this category, which is also the context in which issues about mentally healthy work are generally raised.
Mentally healthy work
In 2020, WorkSafe established a Mentally Healthy Work team of subject matter experts to provide support and direction in relation to psychosocial hazards.
In addition, Kaimahi Hauora was created, which is a small team of specialist health inspectors with a dedicated focus on health, including mentally healthy work.
Notably, in 2021 the Kaimahi Hauora team responded to 134 mentally healthy work concerns — a figure which rose to 229 in 2022.
These concerns are received via the same channels as other concerns, including the use of a dedicated mentally healthy work form available on the WorkSafe website.
Whichever route is used to raise a concern, all information is initially handled in the National Response Centre (NRC), which then acknowledges receipt of information, creates an entry in the notification database, and triages the concern to the appropriate team, while indicating a suggested prioritisation category.
Most mentally healthy work concerns are triaged directly to the Kaimahi Hauora team for review. The Kaimahi Hauora process is guided by a mentally healthy work pathway, which outlines and, as far as possible, standardises the steps taken when responding to concerns.
All notifications received are reviewed by a multidisciplinary team and are carefully considered to determine what regulatory response is appropriate to the circumstances.
WorkSafe intervention
WorkSafe’s operational policy When we intervene 2 sets out how intervention decisions are made once a health and safety risk or harm has been identified. The policy points out that it is necessary for WorkSafe to make deliberate choices about when and how to intervene, given limited resources and a desire to have the maximum impact on work-related health and safety in New Zealand.
The intervention criteria identified in this document are:
the risk or harm sits within WorkSafe’s area of responsibility;
WorkSafe is best placed to intervene if there is an overlap with another agency’s responsibility;
the significance of the risk or harm means that it warrants intervention; and
intervention is an effective use of resources.
WorkSafe does not only focus on compliance with the rules, but also works to promote and embed positive health and safety practices across the motu. To do this, it collaborates with businesses, workers, health and safety representatives, industry bodies, and others.
Its activities go beyond enforcement (which refers to more than prosecution) and into engagement and education to achieve long-term and sustainable change for businesses for the benefit of all those involved in work.
WorkSafe does have an enforcement function and, while a breach of duty resulting in psychosocial harm is yet to be prosecuted, a number of Improvement Notices have been issued and responded to by the organisations concerned.
Such notices require the business to take corrective action within a specified timeframe and can result in financial penalties for a business that does not comply. Notices issued to date have required businesses to improve psychosocial risk monitoring and data recording, develop and update policy portfolios relating to mentally healthy work, review risk reporting systems, etc. So far, all Notices have been complied with.
For clarity, a WorkSafe intervention into a mentally healthy work matter will not:
require a person to be disciplined or dismissed;
prove whether a person is a bully (for example);
mediate between parties;
restore working relationships to a friendly/positive state;
provide legal advice or counselling;
award compensation; or
deal with employment-related matters or discrimination.
The WorkSafe position statement Supporting mentally healthy work 3 sets out what is expected of persons conducting a business or undertaking (PCBUs) in supporting mentally healthy work.
It provides a definition of mentally healthy work, a clear indication that the Health and Safety at Work Act 2015 (HSWA) requires businesses to provide and maintain a work environment that is without risks to safety and health, and an indication of what WorkSafe will do if it becomes aware of mental health issues. It also states that it is unlikely that WorkSafe will intervene for one-off notifications.
Many factors are considered when making this decision, including the risk of injury, the seriousness of the harm and the compliance history of the business or undertaking. There is also a clear statement regarding which situations might prompt WorkSafe to consider intervening, these are:
multiple events arising at one PCBU;
a high level of harm resulting from the failure to manage risks; and/or
industry-wide or organisation-wide failings.

Part 1 of this series of articles looked at when WorkSafe New Zealand should intervene when an allegation of workplace bullying is raised. In this article, we explore in more detail the widespread effects of bullying and the challenges of regulation and intervention
T he WorkSafe ‘New Zealand National Psychosocial Survey 2021: Overview’ 1 explored worker exposure to offensive behaviours, specifically:
Bullying.
Cyberbullying.
Sexual harassment.
Threats of violence.
Physical violence.
The results show that over one-third of workers report being exposed to at least one of the five offensive behaviours in the previous 12 months. This is consistent with statistics reported over recent years by the Massey University Workplace Barometer study 2 , the Human Rights Commission3, Diversity Works4 and others.
‘Exposure’ in this case refers to either direct experience or witnessing it occurring to others. While some offensive behaviours are more common in certain industries, it does appear that each of the offensive behaviours is experienced across all sectors. All behaviours, except for bullying, were more commonly experienced by younger workers and all behaviours were experienced more by Māori workers.
During the period between 1 July 2021 and 30 June 2022, the Kaimahi Hauora team received 153 mentally healthy work notifications. A majority of these related to bullying (118 notifications — 77%) and the remainder related to other concerns — eg, work stress and fatigue (35 notifications — 23%).
Data from WorkSafe’s 2020 Segmentation and insights program: Employers and workers5 is consistent with other extant data that shows approximately 15% of workers5 (about 430,000 individuals) report an experience of bullying in any 12-month period. These are estimates based on self-reported data, which can often yield an overestimate. However, if even a small portion of these meet WorkSafe’s widely accepted definition of (experiencing) bullying, this would equate to many thousands of workers each year.
Challenges of regulation and intervention
An issue of this magnitude cannot easily be resolved one case at a time. High-level prevention programmes addressing the reasons why some people bully are needed, as well as the implementation of systems for early/transparent reporting and resolution.
As in all areas of health and safety, instead of waiting for the harm to happen before we act, we must design and put into effect work systems which address the contextual factors which can lead to bullying.
In most cases, WorkSafe will expect that, prior to any notification, the worker has attempted to resolve their difficulties within the workplace by talking with a senior colleague, manager, Health and Safety Representative (HSR), or by using existing resolution channels.
Where issues arise from employment or contractual matters — eg, disagreements primarily based around working hours, fulfilment of work contract commitments, etc — or where the solution to a problem may rest within the employment contract domain, WorkSafe will usually advise the parties to seek support from the appropriate agency — usually the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) — or another source of mediation support.
Sometimes it can be unclear whether the origins and resolution of an issue rest within the realm of People and Culture (Human Resources) or Health and Safety because there are elements of both, and successful assessment and resolution can involve an ability to bridge both domains.
Of course, it is also acknowledged that it is not always possible, or even advisable, for a worker to make attempts to resolve difficulties using established workplace processes, especially if they are poorly designed or implemented.
Summary
The mental health of workers is not a new consideration within our work health and safety framework; notwithstanding this fact, it has not previously been afforded the attention it is receiving at the present time.
It is possible that the Covid-19 pandemic and exhortations to be kind and “look after each other” may have focused our attention on the occasions when we are not kind to our fellow workers. High (media) profile cases of unacceptable behaviour in some workplaces may also have led to recognition that psychosocial hazards are present in all workplaces, and harm is present in most.
Now we have the data and insights about when and where the risks exist, we need to focus on building interventions that both support businesses to operate and be productive, while also prioritising the safety and health, including mental health, of all workers.

In our article of November last year, we flagged the proposed changes to the Building Act 2004, one of which will be to make written contracts mandatory for certain types of construction work. There will also be new requirements that must be included in such contracts.
While NZS3910 may not be the contract of choice for your average residential project, it’s appropriate for longer or more complex projects and the newly updated NZS3910:2013 has added components that are worth knowing about.
This follows a review that focused primarily on feedback from the construction industry, which saw 1,000 submissions and spanned a two-year period. The review resulted in a new standard form of contract that is much more comprehensive and user-friendly, and can be downloaded from the Standards New Zealand website .
In this article, we outline some of the key changes introduced by NZS3910:2013, which current users need to be aware of. The changes present a timely opportunity for contractors to consider the best contract for their needs and, for those currently using some other form of construction contract, to consider the suitability of NZS3910:2013.
Although described as “a limited technical review”, NZS3910 has changed significantly. Summarised ext are the key changes:
Three standards from one
Perhaps the most significant change is that NZS3910 has been split into three standards, which together replace NZS3190:2003:
NZS3910:2013;
NZS3916:2013 (design and construct); and
NZS3917:2013 (fixed term).
Structure
The contract agreement has been relocated to the front of the contract, so it is no longer hidden at the back of the second schedule. Further additional schedules have been added to incorporate already widely-used documents, including:
Schedule 13: Form of Contractor (or Subcontractor) Warranty
Schedule 14: Agreement for off-site Materials
Schedule 15: Practical Completion Certificate
Schedule 16: Final Completion Certificate
Also, the guidelines have been rewritten and no longer have contractual status.
Cost reimbursement contracts
NZS3910:2013 introduces a standard process for calculating the contract price under a cost reimbursement contract. In the previous version, this had been left to the parties to describe the process in the contract.
Specific provisions have been added for “cost reimbursement” contracts, including:
The contract price is determined on the basis of net cost plus percentages for overheads and profit.
Records of costs to be claimed by the contractor for reimbursement must be kept for verification purposes.
Certain costs will not be claimable (eg, where there are no records; where the costs are not reasonably incurred; and where costs are due to remedying defects).
An indicative estimate of likely contract price may be required
Comprehensive programme
NZS3910:2013 now requires a contractor to submit a simple programme that shows how they propose to meet the due date for completion. Special conditions may also require the contractor to provide a “Comprehensive Programme”, including details such as work sequencing; a critical path analysis showing activity durations and dependencies; key dates relating to site access; the provision of principal (client) supplied materials and services; and the works of separate contracts.
Safety, quality and traffic management plans
NZS3910:2013 introduces specific requirements for safety, quality and management plans. Previously, these had been left to the principal (client) or engineer to document elsewhere in the contract that the contractor must provide by way of these plans.
Advance notification
NZS3910:2013 introduces an obligation on both the contractor and the engineer to notify the other when either of them becomes aware of any matter likely to vary the contract price, delay completion of the contract works, or result in a breach of a statutory duty in connection with the contract works.
If any of these events occurs, then there is a requirement for the contractor or engineer to meet with each other to explore proposals to deal with the impact of the notified event. The introduction of these new obligations is welcomed, because it will help promote clear communication between the parties.
Insurance
NZS3910:2013 inserts new insurance provisions and the information for insurance forms contained in the Schedules are much more comprehensive. It requires the parties to elect the specific events which are to be covered by the insurances and sets out which party will be liable for insurance deductibles or excesses. Importantly, in the wake of the Christchurch earthquake, forces of nature which are identified as covered in the specific conditions will not be treated as an “excepted risk” (which previously the contractor was permitted to exclude “excepted risks” from its insurance cover).
Progress payments
Payment claims may be made for materials delivered to the site but not yet incorporated in the contract works, and for temporary works, plant or materials not yet on site. NZS3910:2013 sets out a new process within a set timeframe, which coordinates the engineer and contractor agreeing on a provisional payment schedule before a payment claim is formalised.
We have outlined some of the key changes in NZS3910:2013, which current users need to understand. The additional schedules and provisions are significant amendments and all contractors should review their written contracts in light of these, perhaps with a view to incorporating those that are particularly relevant.
The updated NZS3910:2013 presents a timely opportunity for contractors to consider the contract best suited to their needs and to those currently using some other form of construction contract, to consider the suitability of that contract.
Please note that there are a number of other changes to NZS3910:2013 that we have not been able to discuss. However, we will keep you updated in relation to the proposed changes to the Building Act 2004 and the requirement to have a written construction contract in future articles. If you have any questions about the latest changes, or would like to discuss them in more detail, please contact Michael Weatherall at Michael.Weatherall@simpsongrierson.com or Jo-Anne Knight at Jo-Anne.Knight@simpsongrierson.com.

The Government has announced that standalone dwellings no greater than 70m 2 (otherwise known as granny flats) will soon be able to be built without a building or resource consent. In this article, Julia Flattery from law firm Duncan Cotterill explores what it means for builders
Building Consent Authorities (BCAs) will not check if granny flats comply with the Building Code. This raises the question – who will take on more risk if a granny flat is defective?
What we know so far
The legislation to exempt granny flats from building and resource consents is still being drafted, so the final requirements are not yet confirmed.
The Government’s current proposal includes limits on maximum floor area and height, use of lightweight construction materials, and a requirement that all work be carried out, or supervised by, LBPs and licensed plumbers, drainlayers, gasfitters and electricians. In terms of resource management, site coverage, setbacks and other conditions will still apply.
Homeowners will be required to notify councils before construction and apply for a Project Information Memorandum (PIM). Councils must advise homeowners whether the work is likely to be exempt and, once construction is complete, homeowners must provide plans for council records.
However, councils will not review these for Building Code compliance.
As with all building work, the granny flat must still comply with the Building Code. Without a building consent, however, the council will not inspect or sign off compliance.
What this means for you
With the rise of granny flats, LBPs and other trades may be concerned about obligations and liabilities now that councils will not be inspecting or signing off these buildings.
The implied warranties under the Building Act still apply. Builders remain responsible for ensuring work is carried out in a proper and competent manner and must remedy any defects notified within 12 months of completion.
Currently, New Zealand operates under a joint and several liability model, meaning all parties in a project can be held equally liable if a building is defective. Without council oversight of granny flats, remaining parties may face a greater share of liability.
However, from mid-2026 the Government intends to replace joint and several liability with proportionate liability. Under this model, each party is responsible only for the share of work they carried out. For builders, this would mean liability is limited to their own workmanship rather than the entire project.
How to reduce your risk
Take extra care on these types of projects, as there will be no council oversight.
Continue to build in compliance with the Building Code and supervise subcontractors closely.
Encourage homeowners to notify the council and consider any council feedback.
Ensure your contracts with clients and subcontractors clearly outline risk and liability.
Factor in potential additional costs, including higher insurance premiums.
Some homeowners may still choose to seek a consent and Code Compliance Certificate for peace of mind and resale value.
When will it begin?
The Government expects the granny flat changes to take effect in early 2026. Timeframes for resource consent changes are not yet confirmed but are expected to align with the same rollout.

In response to the Government’s proposed reform of vocational education and training, the Building and Construction Training Fund (BCTF) has said the potential changes don’t do enough to create an industry-led system
A consultation on reforms to replace Te Pūkenga with a “regionally responsive vocation education and training system” ended on 12 September.
Feedback was asked for on three parts of the vocational education and training system:
A redesigned Institute of Technology and Polytechnic network that retains access to tertiary training in our regions, through a combination of stand-alone and federated ITPs.
Options for an industry-led system for standards-setting and industry training.
Changes to vocational education funding from 2026 to better support the reformed system.
Bring back regional institutions
In the consultation document, Tertiary Education and Skills Minister Penny Simmonds stated: “We propose to replace Te Pūkenga with a network of regional institutes of technology and polytechnics (ITPs) and an industry training system that is closer to industry. ITPs that have a clear pathway to financial sustainability as stand-alone institutions will be given greater autonomy under Te Pūkenga from 1 January 2025 and would be re-established as autonomous entities from 1 January 2026.
“We are proposing grouping the remaining ITPs into a federation, anchored by the Open Polytechnic of New Zealand. This would preserve ITPs’ local identities and maintain regional access while using educational programmes, academic and back-office support from the Open Polytechnic so they do not have to do everything themselves.”
Reform doesn’t go far enough
While it “welcomed” the proposed reform, the BCTF (which was formed out of the transfer of all the activities of the Building and Construction Industry Organisation in line with the Review of Vocational Education) has criticised it for letting government agencies retain too much power.
“Under the Government’s proposal, while industry would be involved in developing standards through representation on the statutory body, final sign-off would continue to sit with New Zealand Qualifications Authority,” said BCTF Chief Executive Grant Florence.
“In our view, final sign-off of standards should sit with respective industry peak bodies (the trade equivalent of a professional body, such as Engineering New Zealand) rather than continuing to sit with government agencies, so that it is truly industry-led.”
More incentives required
The BCTF also said it would prefer to see measures introduced to incentivise more on-job apprenticeship training.
“The building and construction sector [could] add a training levy to the Licensed Building Practitioner Framework, which would ensure that all potential employers of qualified tradespersons are sharing in the cost of their training rather than relying on the goodwill of a small number of employers who do training apprentices – as is the case currently.
“Not only would this likely incentivise more employers to take on apprentices, the funding raised by the levy could contribute to new apprenticeship training opportunities, including the development of ‘train the trainer’ programmes to enhance the quality of on-job training and overall learning outcomes,” said Florence.

When setting up your business or restructuring your current business, there are many things to consider – one of them being what entity structure to go with
Before you begin the exercise of picking a business structure, you need to ask yourself a few questions:
Will you be looking for investors?
Are you wanting to grow the business?
Will you want to sell the business in the future?
In this article, we examine the most common structures and their legal consequences.
Limited Liability Company
This is the most common form of business entity in New Zealand. A limited liability company is a legal entity separate from the people who own and run the company (eg, the director(s) and shareholder(s)). Companies are governed by the Companies Act 1993, their constitutions (if they have one) and the common law that applies to all businesses.
Advantages The main advantage of a company is it provides its owners (eg, shareholders) with limited liability to creditors. This encourages investment, as the risks for shareholders are greatly reduced. This limited liability is often circumvented by creditors (such as banks) requiring personal guarantees from the individuals involved.
Directors have duties to the shareholders and creditors and can be held personally liable for company debt in certain situations, such as trading while insolvent, or if they have given personal guarantees. It is therefore important that directors understand the responsibilities of their role.
Structuring the business as a separate legal entity also makes it easier to sell. The business is not specifically tied to individuals and can continue to operate indefinitely. It is easier to obtain funding and investment, which is necessary for a business to grow.
Disadvantages Incorporating a company is more complicated than other business structures, as it bears legal and financial obligations. For example, you must file annual returns in both the Companies Office and with Inland Revenue, and different tax obligations apply. There is more regulation, and consequently more paperwork and costs associated with operating a company. Conversely, this gives the business credibility.
Sole Trader/Proprietor
A sole trader structure is commonly used for small businesses. It simply involves an individual operating a business. A sole trader will need to comply with legislation and common law that applies to businesses generally.
Advantages This structure is straightforward because there is no separate legal entity from the operator. The start-up costs are low and it is easy to set up.
As a single person owns the business, there is little cause for friction or disputes over the operation of the business. The sole trader controls the business and gets all the profits. It is also possible to offset losses against other income.
Closing a business is very simple and can be carried out at little cost.
Disadvantages The key disadvantage of the sole trader structure is that an owner’s personal liability is unlimited. The owner is personally liable for any business debts or losses, including taxes. All of their assets, such as their family home and other personal bank accounts, are vulnerable to claims arising from the business. Operating as a sole trader can therefore be risky without the right asset protection (such as a family trust) and insurance in place.
It is more difficult to grow a sole trader business because it is harder to get loans and attract investment. It can also be difficult to sell as a working business due to the links to an individual.
Partnership
A partnership is established when two or more people or organisations form a business. This is a popular structure for professionals such as architects and lawyers. In a formal partnership, the partners set out in an agreement how the profits, debts and work will be shared. However, a partnership can also be informal and unincorporated.
Advantages A partnership allows for the sharing of responsibilities and expenses when running a business. In a partnership you can work collaboratively with others and it enables each partner to specialise and diversify; growing the business.
A partnership can bring in more capital investment and partners can also offset losses against other income.
The procedures and costs of formation and winding up are minimal, compared to a company.
Disadvantages Each partner is liable for all of the partnership’s debts. Without appropriate asset management, this may put their personal assets at risk.
Summary
Choosing a particular structure impacts your potential liabilities and how you operate, grow or sell your business. Accordingly, it is worth investing the time and resources (including investing in the right legal, tax and insurance advice) into assessing what structure will best suit you and your business.
It is also important to keep in mind that, as your business changes, you may wish to shift between structures. You may start out in business as a sole trader and then later form a partnership with someone, or, as your business grows, decide to incorporate a company. Always bear in mind that your obligations and the risks under each structure will change with each entity.
